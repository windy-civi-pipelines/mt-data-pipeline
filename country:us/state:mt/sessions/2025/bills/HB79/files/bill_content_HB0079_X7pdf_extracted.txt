fire hazard to be created, except where a minimum slash hazard would exist, by entering into a fire hazard

amounts for master fire hazard reduction agreements are calculated to cover the potential cost to the
department for fire hazard abatement in case of default and are based on the average annual volume of
uncompleted abatement. Master fire hazard reduction agreement bonds are to be administered as nonsite-
specific umbrella bonds, for which the entire bond or any portion of the bond may be collected to pay for
unabated fire hazards on all sites covered by the bond. The department shall review master fire hazard
reduction agreement bond amounts at least annually. The bonds must be adjusted according to the volume of
timber harvested and the level of compliance of the bond provider.
(3) The agreement must provide that:
(a) all fire hazard reduction or management work comprising nonburning methods and

by the agreement; and
(b) all burning work must be completed as specified in the agreement and in compliance with rules
adopted under this part.
(4) The bond must be released upon the issuance of the certificate of clearance. At the request of
the fire hazard reduction agreement holder, cash bonds for fire hazard reduction agreements exceeding
200,000 board feet, or the equivalent, must be partially released upon satisfactory completion of slash piling if
the fire hazard reduction agreement holder has a record of compliance with the provisions of 76-13-407 or this

Section 4:
section. The department may inspect the sites for which release or partial release is being requested, or it may
rely on the submittal of a signed affidavit provided by the person posting the bond. A person that submits a
fraudulent affidavit is subject to the penalty provisions of 45-7-202, may have other fire hazard reduction
agreements revoked, or may be denied the issuance of fire hazard reduction agreements in the future.

The written exemption under this subsection (5)(a) must be provided to the purchaser at the time of delivery of
the forest products being sold.
(b) An activity that creates a minimum slash hazard is exempt from the provisions of this part if no
