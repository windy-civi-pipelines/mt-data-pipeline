Section 1:
69th Legislature 2025 HJ 1
MONTANA URGING THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO FULLY FUND PUBLIC SAFETY AND LAW
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, PROGRAMS, SERVICES, AND ACTIVITIES WITHIN MONTANA'S INDIAN
RESERVATIONS.
WHEREAS, the Constitution of the United States of America, through the Treaty and Supremacy
Clauses, acknowledges Indian nations and tribes as prior sovereigns; and
WHEREAS, through treaties, agreements, statutes, and executive orders, Indian nations and tribes
came under the protection of the United States while reserving original sovereign authority and self-government
over tribal members and territories; and
WHEREAS, through treaties, agreements, statutes, and executive orders, the United States undertook
a federal trust responsibility, among other responsibilities, to assist Indian nations and tribes in providing public
safety, law and order, and the administration of justice; and
WHEREAS, Montana's reservations have seen drug and alcohol abuse become an epidemic as
methamphetamine, heroin, fentanyl, and other drugs have overtaken tribal lands, causing violent crime,
domestic disturbance, and trouble among youth; and
WHEREAS, generations of Montana's Native Americans have mourned a missing or murdered family
member or loved one, experienced unacceptably high levels of violence, and been victims of violent crime at
rates much higher than national averages; and
WHEREAS, justice has eluded many Native American victims, survivors, and families, while criminal
jurisdiction complexities and insufficient funding have left many injustices unaddressed; and
WHEREAS, levels of federal funding for tribal public safety, law enforcement, and tribal courts have
consistently remained insufficient to fully fund the necessary public safety activities.
