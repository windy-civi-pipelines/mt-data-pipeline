10 WHEREAS, the Constitution of the United States of America, through the Treaty and Supremacy
11 Clauses, acknowledges Indian nations and tribes as prior sovereigns; and

26 WHEREAS, levels of federal funding for tribal public safety, law enforcement, and tribal courts have
27 consistently remained insufficient to fully fund the necessary public safety activities.
