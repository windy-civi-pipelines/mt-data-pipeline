6 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT PROVIDING FOR A GREENHOUSE GAS ASSESSMENT UNDER
7 THE MONTANA ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT; REVISING DIRECTIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
8 IMPACT STATEMENTS RELATED TO GREENHOUSE GAS ASSESSMENTS; PROVIDING DEFINITIONS;
9 AMENDING SECTIONS 75-1-201, 75-1-202, AND 75-1-220, MCA; AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.”
10
11 WHEREAS, the Montana Supreme Court found that the Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA)
12 "must be construed in harmony with the substantive limitations of an agency's applicable regulatory authority"
13 (paragraph 30, Bitterrooters for Planning, Inc. v. Montana Department of Environmental Quality, 2017 MT 222,
14 388 Mont. 453, 401 P.3d 712), but also found that the Legislature granted broad authority to the Department of
15 Environmental Quality (paragraph 53, Montana Environmental Information Center v. Department of
16 Environmental Quality, DA 23-0225 (2023)); and
17 WHEREAS, the Legislature is troubled by the court's overreach and strongly disagrees with the court's
18 Held decision but recognizes that without providing direction and clear statutory sideboard, there will be
19 regulatory uncertainty and unnecessary, expensive, and continued litigation; and
20 WHEREAS, the earth's climate has never been in stasis, and there are different scientific views of the
21 degree to which human activities are influencing current climatological trends and the degree to which the
22 curtailment of human activities would affect current trends; and
23 WHEREAS, the court notes that section 75-1-201(4)(a), MCA, clarifies that an "agency may not
24 withhold, deny, or impose conditions on any permit or other authority to act based on" MEPA alone. MEPA thus
25 provides a review process for an agency's permitting consideration; it is not a regulatory enforcement law.
26 MEPA expresses the Legislature's intent that state agencies fully consider all aspects of a proposal and ensure
27 that "the public is informed of the anticipated impacts in Montana of potential state actions" (paragraph 57,
28 Montana Environmental Information Center v. Department of Environmental Quality, DA 23-0225 (2023)); and
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – SB 221

69th Legislature 2025 SB 221.1
1 WHEREAS, the court stipulates that "we did not hold in Held, and do not hold here, that DEQ is
2 required to analyze GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions for every potential state action…nor do we hold that DEQ
3 must regulate GHG emissions in an air quality permit application"; and
4 WHEREAS, the court further stipulates the department's lack of substantive authority to regulate
5 greenhouse gases and lack of authority to grant or deny a permit based on greenhouse gas emissions does not
6 absolve the agency from conducting analysis of greenhouse gas emissions in a MEPA review (paragraph 58,
7 Montana Environmental Information Center v. Department of Environmental Quality, DA 23-0225 (2023)); and
8 WHEREAS, with the court's recognitions of the regulatory limitations of MEPA to deny a permit based
9 on greenhouse gas emissions analysis and the department's recognition of its "obligation to make an adequate
10 compilation of relevant information, to analyze it reasonably, and to consider all pertinent data," (paragraph 61,
11 Montana Environmental Information Center v. Department of Environmental Quality, DA 23-0225 (2023)), the
12 Legislature directs the department to conduct an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions for state actions
13 involving fossil fuel activities; and
14 WHEREAS, the Legislature stipulates that the greenhouse gas analysis is intended to satisfy the
15 informational requirements under MEPA and that greenhouse gases will not be regulated.

17 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
18
19 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Greenhouse gas assessment. (1) Except as provided in 75-1-201(3), a
20 state agency, when conducting an environmental review in accordance with parts 1 through 3 of this chapter:
21 (a) may conduct a greenhouse gas assessment in accordance with 75-1-201 for a proposed action
22 if the agency determines the assessment is necessary to meet the requirements of parts 1 through 3 of this
23 chapter; or
24 (b) shall conduct a greenhouse gas assessment in accordance with 75-1-201 for a proposed
25 action that is defined as a fossil fuel activity as provided in 75-1-220.
26 (2) A greenhouse gas assessment is not required for a proposed action exempted from review
27 under parts 1 through 3 of this chapter or for categorical exclusions as provided in agency rules, programmatic

5 viability for similar projects having similar conditions and physical locations and determined without regard to
6 the economic strength of the specific project sponsor;
7 (II) the agency proposing the alternative shall consult with the project sponsor regarding any
8 proposed alternative, and the agency shall give due weight and consideration to the project sponsor's
9 comments regarding the proposed alternative;
10 (III) the agency shall complete a meaningful no-action alternative analysis. The no-action
11 alternative analysis must include the projected beneficial and adverse environmental, social, and economic
12 impact of the project's noncompletion.
13 (D) any regulatory impacts on private property rights, including whether alternatives that reduce,
14 minimize, or eliminate the regulation of private property rights have been analyzed. The analysis in this
15 subsection (1)(b)(iv)(D) need not be prepared if the proposed action does not involve the regulation of private
16 property.
17 (E) the relationship between local short-term uses of the Montana human Montana's environment
18 and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity;
19 (F) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources that would be involved in the
20 proposed action if it is implemented;
21 (G) the customer fiscal impact analysis, if required by 69-2-216; and

24 (v) in accordance with the criteria set forth in subsection (1)(b)(iv)(C), study, develop, and describe
25 appropriate alternatives to recommend courses of action in any proposal that involves unresolved conflicts
26 concerning alternative uses of available resources. If the alternatives analysis is conducted for a project that is
27 not a state-sponsored project and alternatives are recommended, the project sponsor may volunteer to
28 implement the alternative. Neither the alternatives analysis nor the resulting recommendations bind the project

15 government, as defined in 7-12-1103, that may be directly impacted by the project. The responsible state
16 official shall also consult with and obtain comments from any state agency in Montana with respect to any
17 regulation of private property involved. Copies of the statement and the comments and views of the appropriate
18 state, federal, and local agencies that are authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards must be
19 made available to the governor, the environmental quality council, and the public and must accompany the
20 proposal through the existing agency review processes.
21 (d) a transfer of an ownership interest in a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for
22 use or permission to act by an agency, either singly or in combination with other state agencies, does not

1 (v)(iv) A customer fiscal impact analysis pursuant to 69-2-216 or an allegation that the customer fiscal
2 impact analysis is inadequate may not be used as the basis of an action challenging or seeking review of the
3 agency's decision.
4 (b) (i) When a party challenging the decision or the adequacy of the environmental review or
5 decision presents information not in the record certified by the agency, the challenging party shall certify under
6 oath in an affidavit that the information is new, material, and significant evidence that was not publicly available
7 before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the decision or the adequacy of the agency's environmental
8 review.
9 (ii) If upon reviewing the affidavit the court finds that the proffered information is new, material, and
10 significant evidence that was not publicly available before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the
11 decision or to the adequacy of the agency's environmental review, the court shall remand the new evidence to
12 the agency for the agency's consideration and an opportunity to modify its decision or environmental review
13 before the court considers the evidence as a part of the administrative record under review.
14 (iii) If the court finds that the information in the affidavit does not meet the requirements of
15 subsection (6)(b)(i), the court may not remand the matter to the agency or consider the proffered information in
16 making its decision.
17 (c) (i) The remedies provided in this section for successful challenges to a decision of the agency
18 or the adequacy of the statement are exclusive.
19 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-19-201 and 27-19-314, a court having considered the
20 pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
21 injunction, permanent injunction, or other equitable relief may not enjoin the issuance or effectiveness of a
22 license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court
23 specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not to prevail on the merits of its
24 complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in the absence of a temporary
25 restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or other equitable relief, that the:
26 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
27 (B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
28 the public interest, a court:
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – SB 221
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 221.1
1 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
2 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
3 findings with respect to both.
4 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
5 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
6 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
7 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
8 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
9 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
10 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
11 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
12 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
13 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking
14 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
15 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
16 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
17 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
18 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
19 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
20 and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
21 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
22 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
23 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
24 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
25 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
26 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
27 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
28 (f) Attorney fees or costs may not be awarded to the prevailing party in an action alleging
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – SB 221

1 noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3.
2 (7) For purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
3 inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
4 to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
5 that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding
6 pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
7 (8) The director of the agency responsible for the determination or recommendation shall endorse
8 in writing any determination of significance made under subsection (1)(b)(iv) or any recommendation that a
9 determination of significance be made.
10 (9) A project sponsor may request a review of the significance determination or recommendation
11 made under subsection (8) by the appropriate board, if any. The appropriate board may, at its discretion, submit
12 an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue. The period of time between the request for a
13 review and completion of a review under this subsection may not be included for the purposes of determining
14 compliance with the time limits established for environmental review in 75-1-208."
15
16 Section 3. Section 75-1-202, MCA, is amended to read:
17 "75-1-202. Agency rules to prescribe fees. Each agency of state government charged with the
18 responsibility of issuing a lease, permit, contract, license, or certificate under any provision of state law may
19 adopt rules prescribing fees that must be paid by a person, corporation, partnership, firm, association, or other
20 private entity when an application for a lease, permit, contract, license, or certificate will require an agency to
21 compile an environmental impact statement as prescribed by 75-1-201 and the agency has not made the
22 finding under 75-1-205(1)(a). An agency shall determine whether it will be necessary to compile an
23 environmental impact statement and assess a fee as prescribed by this section within any statutory timeframe
24 for issuance of the lease, permit, contract, license, or certificate or, if no statutory timeframe is provided, within
25 90 days. Except as provided in 85-2-124, the fee assessed under this section may be used only to gather data
26 and information necessary to compile an environmental impact statement as defined in parts 1 through 3. A fee
27 may not be assessed if an agency intends only to file a negative declaration stating that the proposed project
28 will not have a significant impact on the human Montana's environment."

1 SENATE BILL NO. 221
2 INTRODUCED BY W. GALT, M. VINTON, E. ALBUS, C. COCHRAN, S. GIST, C. SPRUNGER, D. LOGE, M.
3 REGIER, S. VINTON, M. YAKAWICH, S. FITZPATRICK, B. LER, J. SCHILLINGER, G. OBLANDER, K.

6 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT PROVIDING FOR A GREENHOUSE GAS ASSESSMENT UNDER
7 THE MONTANA ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT; REVISING DIRECTIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
8 IMPACT STATEMENTS RELATED TO GREENHOUSE GAS ASSESSMENTS; PROVIDING DEFINITIONS;
9 AMENDING SECTIONS 75-1-201, 75-1-202, AND 75-1-220, MCA; AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.”
10
11 WHEREAS, the Montana Supreme Court found that the Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA)
12 "must be construed in harmony with the substantive limitations of an agency's applicable regulatory authority"
13 (paragraph 30, Bitterrooters for Planning, Inc. v. Montana Department of Environmental Quality, 2017 MT 222,
14 388 Mont. 453, 401 P.3d 712), but also found that the Legislature granted broad authority to the Department of
15 Environmental Quality (paragraph 53, Montana Environmental Information Center v. Department of
16 Environmental Quality, DA 23-0225 (2023)); and
17 WHEREAS, the Legislature is troubled by the court's overreach and strongly disagrees with the court's
18 Held decision but recognizes that without providing direction and clear statutory sideboard, there will be
19 regulatory uncertainty and unnecessary, expensive, and continued litigation; and
20 WHEREAS, the earth's climate has never been in stasis, and there are different scientific views of the
21 degree to which human activities are influencing current climatological trends and the degree to which the
22 curtailment of human activities would affect current trends; and
23 WHEREAS, the court notes that section 75-1-201(4)(a), MCA, clarifies that an "agency may not
24 withhold, deny, or impose conditions on any permit or other authority to act based on" MEPA alone. MEPA thus
25 provides a review process for an agency's permitting consideration; it is not a regulatory enforcement law.
26 MEPA expresses the Legislature's intent that state agencies fully consider all aspects of a proposal and ensure
27 that "the public is informed of the anticipated impacts in Montana of potential state actions" (paragraph 57,
28 Montana Environmental Information Center v. Department of Environmental Quality, DA 23-0225 (2023)); and
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – SB 221

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 221.1
1 WHEREAS, the court stipulates that "we did not hold in Held, and do not hold here, that DEQ is
2 required to analyze GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions for every potential state action…nor do we hold that DEQ
3 must regulate GHG emissions in an air quality permit application"; and
4 WHEREAS, the court further stipulates the department's lack of substantive authority to regulate
5 greenhouse gases and lack of authority to grant or deny a permit based on greenhouse gas emissions does not
6 absolve the agency from conducting analysis of greenhouse gas emissions in a MEPA review (paragraph 58,
7 Montana Environmental Information Center v. Department of Environmental Quality, DA 23-0225 (2023)); and
8 WHEREAS, with the court's recognitions of the regulatory limitations of MEPA to deny a permit based
9 on greenhouse gas emissions analysis and the department's recognition of its "obligation to make an adequate
10 compilation of relevant information, to analyze it reasonably, and to consider all pertinent data," (paragraph 61,
11 Montana Environmental Information Center v. Department of Environmental Quality, DA 23-0225 (2023)), the
12 Legislature directs the department to conduct an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions for state actions
13 involving fossil fuel activities; and
14 WHEREAS, the Legislature stipulates that the greenhouse gas analysis is intended to satisfy the
15 informational requirements under MEPA and that greenhouse gases will not be regulated.
16
17 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
18
19 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Greenhouse gas assessment. (1) Except as provided in 75-1-201(3), a
20 state agency, when conducting an environmental review in accordance with parts 1 through 3 of this chapter:
21 (a) may conduct a greenhouse gas assessment in accordance with 75-1-201 for a proposed action
22 if the agency determines the assessment is necessary to meet the requirements of parts 1 through 3 of this
23 chapter; or
24 (b) shall conduct a greenhouse gas assessment in accordance with 75-1-201 for a proposed
25 action that is defined as a fossil fuel activity as provided in 75-1-220.
26 (2) A greenhouse gas assessment is not required for a proposed action exempted from review
27 under parts 1 through 3 of this chapter or for categorical exclusions as provided in agency rules, programmatic
28 review, or statute.

3 "75-1-201. General directions -- environmental impact statements. (1) The legislature authorizes
4 and directs that, to the fullest extent possible:
5 (a) the policies, regulations, and laws of the state must be interpreted and administered in
6 accordance with the policies set forth in parts 1 through 3;
7 (b) under this part, all agencies of the state, except the legislature and except as provided in
8 subsections (2) and (3) subsection (3), shall:
9 (i) use a systematic, interdisciplinary approach that will ensure:
10 (A) the integrated use of the natural and social sciences and the environmental design arts in
11 planning and in decisionmaking for a state-sponsored project that may have an impact on the Montana human
12 Montana's environment by projects in Montana; and
13 (B) that in any environmental review that is not subject to subsection (1)(b)(iv), when an agency
14 considers alternatives, the alternative analysis will be in compliance with the provisions of subsections

21 that may impact the human environment in Montana Montana's environment are evaluated for regulatory
22 restrictions on private property, as provided in subsection (1)(b)(iv)(D);
23 (iv) include in each recommendation or report on proposals for projects, programs, and other major
24 actions of state government significantly affecting the quality of the human environment in Montana Montana's
25 environment a detailed statement on:

1 (C) alternatives to the proposed action. An analysis of any alternative included in the environmental
2 review must comply with the following criteria:
3 (I) any alternative proposed must be reasonable, in that the alternative must be achievable under

5 viability for similar projects having similar conditions and physical locations and determined without regard to
6 the economic strength of the specific project sponsor;
7 (II) the agency proposing the alternative shall consult with the project sponsor regarding any
8 proposed alternative, and the agency shall give due weight and consideration to the project sponsor's
9 comments regarding the proposed alternative;
10 (III) the agency shall complete a meaningful no-action alternative analysis. The no-action
11 alternative analysis must include the projected beneficial and adverse environmental, social, and economic
12 impact of the project's noncompletion.
13 (D) any regulatory impacts on private property rights, including whether alternatives that reduce,
14 minimize, or eliminate the regulation of private property rights have been analyzed. The analysis in this
15 subsection (1)(b)(iv)(D) need not be prepared if the proposed action does not involve the regulation of private
16 property.
17 (E) the relationship between local short-term uses of the Montana human Montana's environment
18 and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity;
19 (F) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources that would be involved in the
20 proposed action if it is implemented;
21 (G) the customer fiscal impact analysis, if required by 69-2-216; and

24 (v) in accordance with the criteria set forth in subsection (1)(b)(iv)(C), study, develop, and describe
25 appropriate alternatives to recommend courses of action in any proposal that involves unresolved conflicts
26 concerning alternative uses of available resources. If the alternatives analysis is conducted for a project that is
27 not a state-sponsored project and alternatives are recommended, the project sponsor may volunteer to
28 implement the alternative. Neither the alternatives analysis nor the resulting recommendations bind the project

16 official shall also consult with and obtain comments from any state agency in Montana with respect to any
17 regulation of private property involved. Copies of the statement and the comments and views of the appropriate
18 state, federal, and local agencies that are authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards must be

1 (v)(iv) A customer fiscal impact analysis pursuant to 69-2-216 or an allegation that the customer fiscal
2 impact analysis is inadequate may not be used as the basis of an action challenging or seeking review of the

4 (b) (i) When a party challenging the decision or the adequacy of the environmental review or
5 decision presents information not in the record certified by the agency, the challenging party shall certify under
6 oath in an affidavit that the information is new, material, and significant evidence that was not publicly available
7 before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the decision or the adequacy of the agency's environmental
8 review.
9 (ii) If upon reviewing the affidavit the court finds that the proffered information is new, material, and
10 significant evidence that was not publicly available before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the
11 decision or to the adequacy of the agency's environmental review, the court shall remand the new evidence to
12 the agency for the agency's consideration and an opportunity to modify its decision or environmental review
13 before the court considers the evidence as a part of the administrative record under review.
14 (iii) If the court finds that the information in the affidavit does not meet the requirements of
15 subsection (6)(b)(i), the court may not remand the matter to the agency or consider the proffered information in
16 making its decision.
17 (c) (i) The remedies provided in this section for successful challenges to a decision of the agency
18 or the adequacy of the statement are exclusive.
19 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-19-201 and 27-19-314, a court having considered the
20 pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
21 injunction, permanent injunction, or other equitable relief may not enjoin the issuance or effectiveness of a
22 license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court
23 specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not to prevail on the merits of its
24 complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in the absence of a temporary
25 restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or other equitable relief, that the:
26 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
27 (B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
28 the public interest, a court:
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – SB 221

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 221.1
1 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
2 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
3 findings with respect to both.
4 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
5 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
6 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
7 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
8 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
9 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
10 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
11 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
12 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
13 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking
14 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
15 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
16 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
17 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
18 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
19 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
20 and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
21 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
22 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
23 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
24 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
25 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
26 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
27 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
28 (f) Attorney fees or costs may not be awarded to the prevailing party in an action alleging

1 noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3.
2 (7) For purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
3 inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
4 to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
5 that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding
6 pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
7 (8) The director of the agency responsible for the determination or recommendation shall endorse
8 in writing any determination of significance made under subsection (1)(b)(iv) or any recommendation that a
9 determination of significance be made.
10 (9) A project sponsor may request a review of the significance determination or recommendation
11 made under subsection (8) by the appropriate board, if any. The appropriate board may, at its discretion, submit
12 an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue. The period of time between the request for a
13 review and completion of a review under this subsection may not be included for the purposes of determining
14 compliance with the time limits established for environmental review in 75-1-208."

16 Section 3. Section 75-1-202, MCA, is amended to read:
17 "75-1-202. Agency rules to prescribe fees. Each agency of state government charged with the
18 responsibility of issuing a lease, permit, contract, license, or certificate under any provision of state law may
19 adopt rules prescribing fees that must be paid by a person, corporation, partnership, firm, association, or other
20 private entity when an application for a lease, permit, contract, license, or certificate will require an agency to
21 compile an environmental impact statement as prescribed by 75-1-201 and the agency has not made the
22 finding under 75-1-205(1)(a). An agency shall determine whether it will be necessary to compile an
23 environmental impact statement and assess a fee as prescribed by this section within any statutory timeframe
