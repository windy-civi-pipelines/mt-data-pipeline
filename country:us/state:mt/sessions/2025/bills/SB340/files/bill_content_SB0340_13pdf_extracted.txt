3 planning and in decisionmaking for a state-sponsored project that may have an impact on the Montana human
4 environment by projects in Montana; and
5 (B) that in any environmental review that is not subject to subsection (1)(b)(iv), when an agency

16 actions of state government significantly affecting the quality of the human environment in Montana a detailed

18 (A) the environmental impact of the proposed action;
19 (B) any adverse effects on Montana's environment that cannot be avoided if the proposal is
20 implemented;

69th Legislature 2025 SB 340.1
1 comments regarding the proposed alternative;
2 (III) the agency shall complete a meaningful no-action alternative analysis. The no-action
3 alternative analysis must include the projected beneficial and adverse environmental, social, and economic

17 appropriate alternatives to recommend courses of action in any proposal that involves unresolved conflicts
18 concerning alternative uses of available resources. If the alternatives analysis is conducted for a project that is
19 not a state-sponsored project and alternatives are recommended, the project sponsor may volunteer to
20 implement the alternative. Neither the alternatives analysis nor the resulting recommendations bind the project
21 sponsor to take a recommended course of action, but the project sponsor may agree pursuant to subsection
22 (4)(b) to a specific course of action.
23 (vi) recognize the potential long-range character of environmental impacts in Montana and, when

5 license, certificate, authorization, or other entitlement or authority unless the review is required by a federal
6 agency or the United States congress amends the federal Clean Air Act to include carbon dioxide as a
7 regulated pollutant.
8 (iii) Except as provided in subsection (6)(b), in a challenge to the agency's decision or the
9 adequacy of an environmental review, a court may not consider any information, including but not limited to an
10 issue, comment, argument, proposed alternative, analysis, or evidence, that was not first presented to the
11 agency for the agency's consideration prior to the agency's decision or within the time allowed for comments to
12 be submitted.
13 (iv) Except as provided in subsection (6)(b), the court shall confine its review to the record certified
14 by the agency. The court shall affirm the agency's decision or the environmental review unless the court
15 specifically finds that the agency's decision was arbitrary and capricious.
16 (v) A customer fiscal impact analysis pursuant to 69-2-216 or an allegation that the customer fiscal
17 impact analysis is inadequate may not be used as the basis of an action challenging or seeking review of the

20 decision presents information not in the record certified by the agency, the challenging party shall certify under

22 before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the decision or the adequacy of the agency's environmental
23 review.
24 (ii) If upon reviewing the affidavit the court finds that the proffered information is new, material, and
25 significant evidence that was not publicly available before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the

1 (iii) If the court finds that the information in the affidavit does not meet the requirements of
2 subsection (6)(b)(i), the court may not remand the matter to the agency or consider the proffered information in
3 making its decision.
4 (c) (i) The remedies provided in this section for successful challenges to a decision of the agency
5 or the adequacy of the statement are exclusive.
6 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-19-201 and 27-19-314, a court having considered the
7 pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
8 injunction, permanent injunction, or other equitable relief may not enjoin the issuance or effectiveness of a
9 license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court
10 specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not to prevail on the merits of its
11 complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in the absence of a temporary
12 restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or other equitable relief, that the:
13 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
14 (B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
15 the public interest, a court:
16 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
17 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
18 findings with respect to both.
19 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
20 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
21 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
22 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
23 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
24 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
25 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
26 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
27 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
28 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking

1 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
2 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
3 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
4 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
5 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
6 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
7 and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
8 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
9 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
10 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
11 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
12 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
13 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
14 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
15 (f) Attorney (i) Except as expressly authorized by statute, fees or costs may not be awarded to the
16 prevailing party in an action alleging noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of brought
17 under parts 1 through 3.
18 (ii) Subsection (6)(f)(i) does not affect any right to recover fees or costs that may exist under
19 federal law.
20 (7) For purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
21 inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
22 to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
23 that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding
24 pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
25 (8) The director of the agency responsible for the determination or recommendation shall endorse
26 in writing any determination of significance made under subsection (1)(b)(iv) or any recommendation that a
27 determination of significance be made.
28 (9) A project sponsor may request a review of the significance determination or recommendation

1 made under subsection (8) by the appropriate board, if any. The appropriate board may, at its discretion, submit
2 an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue. The period of time between the request for a
3 review and completion of a review under this subsection may not be included for the purposes of determining
4 compliance with the time limits established for environmental review in 75-1-208.
5 (10) (a) If a court remands an agency's decision under parts 1 through 3, the responsible agency
6 shall:
7 (i) complete all required environmental reviews or corrective actions and issue a final decision
8 within 90 days of the court's remand order; and
9 (ii) provide notice of the final decision to all parties involved in the challenge and make the
10 decision available to the public.
11 (b) The 90-day timeline may only be extended if:
12 (i) all parties to the action agree in writing to an extension; or
13 (ii) the agency demonstrates to the court that extraordinary circumstances require additional time,
14 and the court approves a specified extension that may not exceed 60 days.
15 (11) (a) In a subsequent legal action challenging an agency's decision under parts 1 through 3 after
16 a court-ordered remand and agency corrective action, a plaintiff may raise only those issues that:
17 (i) are materially different from issues raised in prior challenges; and
18 (ii) could not have been raised during the prior proceeding with reasonable diligence.
19 (b) This subsection (11) does not limit a plaintiff's right to challenge new or different environmental
20 impacts resulting from changes to the proposed action."

17 appropriate alternatives to recommend courses of action in any proposal that involves unresolved conflicts
18 concerning alternative uses of available resources. If the alternatives analysis is conducted for a project that is
19 not a state-sponsored project and alternatives are recommended, the project sponsor may volunteer to
20 implement the alternative. Neither the alternatives analysis nor the resulting recommendations bind the project
21 sponsor to take a recommended course of action, but the project sponsor may agree pursuant to subsection
22 (4)(b) to a specific course of action.
23 (vi) recognize the potential long-range character of environmental impacts in Montana and, when
24 consistent with the policies of the state, lend appropriate support to initiatives, resolutions, and programs

2 through 3, including a challenge to an agency's decision that an environmental review is not required or a claim
3 that the environmental review is inadequate based in whole or in part upon greenhouse gas emissions and
4 impacts to the climate in Montana or beyond Montana's borders, cannot vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit,
5 license, certificate, authorization, or other entitlement or authority unless the review is required by a federal
6 agency or the United States congress amends the federal Clean Air Act to include carbon dioxide as a
7 regulated pollutant.
8 (iii) Except as provided in subsection (6)(b), in a challenge to the agency's decision or the
9 adequacy of an environmental review, a court may not consider any information, including but not limited to an
10 issue, comment, argument, proposed alternative, analysis, or evidence, that was not first presented to the
11 agency for the agency's consideration prior to the agency's decision or within the time allowed for comments to
12 be submitted.
13 (iv) Except as provided in subsection (6)(b), the court shall confine its review to the record certified
14 by the agency. The court shall affirm the agency's decision or the environmental review unless the court
15 specifically finds that the agency's decision was arbitrary and capricious.
16 (v) A customer fiscal impact analysis pursuant to 69-2-216 or an allegation that the customer fiscal
17 impact analysis is inadequate may not be used as the basis of an action challenging or seeking review of the
18 agency's decision.
19 (b) (i) When a party challenging the decision or the adequacy of the environmental review or
20 decision presents information not in the record certified by the agency, the challenging party shall certify under

22 before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the decision or the adequacy of the agency's environmental
23 review.
24 (ii) If upon reviewing the affidavit the court finds that the proffered information is new, material, and
25 significant evidence that was not publicly available before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the
26 decision or to the adequacy of the agency's environmental review, the court shall remand the new evidence to
27 the agency for the agency's consideration and an opportunity to modify its decision or environmental review
28 before the court considers the evidence as a part of the administrative record under review.

1 (iii) If the court finds that the information in the affidavit does not meet the requirements of
2 subsection (6)(b)(i), the court may not remand the matter to the agency or consider the proffered information in
3 making its decision.
4 (c) (i) The remedies provided in this section for successful challenges to a decision of the agency
5 or the adequacy of the statement are exclusive.
6 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-19-201 and 27-19-314, a court having considered the
7 pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
8 injunction, permanent injunction, or other equitable relief may not enjoin the issuance or effectiveness of a
9 license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court
10 specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not to prevail on the merits of its
11 complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in the absence of a temporary
12 restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or other equitable relief, that the:
13 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
14 (B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
15 the public interest, a court:
16 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
17 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
18 findings with respect to both.
19 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
20 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
21 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
22 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
23 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
24 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
25 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
26 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
27 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
28 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking

1 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
2 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
3 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
4 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
5 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
6 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
7 and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
8 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
9 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
10 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
11 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
12 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
13 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
14 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
15 (f) Attorney (i) Except as expressly authorized by statute, fees or costs may not be awarded to the
16 prevailing party in an action alleging noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of brought
17 under parts 1 through 3.
18 (ii) Subsection (6)(f)(i) does not affect any right to recover fees or costs that may exist under
19 federal law.
20 (7) For purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
21 inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
22 to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
23 that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding
24 pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
25 (8) The director of the agency responsible for the determination or recommendation shall endorse
26 in writing any determination of significance made under subsection (1)(b)(iv) or any recommendation that a
27 determination of significance be made.

6 shall:

8 within 90 days of the court's remand order; and
9 (ii) provide notice of the final decision to all parties involved in the challenge and make the
10 decision available to the public.
11 (b) The 90-day timeline may only be extended if:
12 (i) all parties to the action agree in writing to an extension; or
13 (ii) the agency demonstrates to the court that extraordinary circumstances require additional time,
14 and the court approves a specified extension that may not exceed 60 days.
15 (11) (a) In a subsequent legal action challenging an agency's decision under parts 1 through 3 after
16 a court-ordered remand and agency corrective action, a plaintiff may raise only those issues that:
17 (i) are materially different from issues raised in prior challenges; and
18 (ii) could not have been raised during the prior proceeding with reasonable diligence.
