Section 1:
69th Legislature HJ 54.1
1 HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 54
3
4 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
5 MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY ON WASTE-TO-ENERGY; ANALYZING THE VARIOUS
6 METHODS AND TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATED WITH WASTE-TO-ENERGY; AND REQUIRING THAT THE
7 FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
8
9 WHEREAS, economic, technological, and policy forces are rapidly transforming the supply and
10 demand of electricity on the Montana grid; and
11 WHEREAS, Montana must adopt an all-of-the-above energy strategy as a path to sustainable
12 economic growth, grid reliability, and energy independence; and
13 WHEREAS, in recent years, the United States has averaged nearly 300 million tons of municipal solid
14 waste on an annual basis, causing a significant strain on existing landfill infrastructure; and
15 WHEREAS, across the globe, countries, counties, and municipalities have successfully reduced their
16 waste footprint by constructing waste-to-energy facilities; and
17 WHEREAS, "waste-to-energy" refers to the conversion of nonrecyclable waste materials into useable
18 heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of methods.
19 WHEREAS, methods of waste-to-energy include incineration, gasification, anaerobic digestion,
20 pyrolysis, and landfill gas recovery; and
21 WHEREAS, waste-to-energy facilities could reduce Montana's landfill waste and methane emissions,
22 provide a sustainable power source, and supplement the state's existing base load and intermittent energy
23 generation resources; and
24 WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of Montana to take a proactive approach and investigate all
25 energy generation resource types.
26
27 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF

69th Legislature HJ 54.1
1 That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
2 committee, pursuant to section 5-5-217, MCA, or direct sufficient staff resources to:
3 (1) determine whether waste-to-energy facilities could supplement existing energy generation
4 resources in Montana;
5 (2) analyze the economic impact to Montana's citizens and industries if local governments and
6 utilities pursued waste-to-energy facilities.
7 (3) investigate the methods and technologies utilized in waste-to-energy facilities and the historical
8 implementation of waste-to-energy facilities both domestically and internationally; and
9 (4) assess the social and environmental impact of waste-to-energy facilities to determine whether
10 they could be a safer alternative to traditional waste management methods.
11 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the study is assigned to staff, any findings or conclusions be
12 presented to and reviewed by an appropriate committee designated by the Legislative Council.
13 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all aspects of the study, including presentation and review
14 requirements, be concluded prior to September 15, 2026.
15 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the final results of the study, including any findings, conclusions,
