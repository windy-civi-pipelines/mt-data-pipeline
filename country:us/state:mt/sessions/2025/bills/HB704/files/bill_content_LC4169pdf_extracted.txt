4 before October 17, 2014, and received a certificate of subdivision approval from the department of
5 environmental quality and a predetermination letter from the department before February 14, 2024, then the
6 water uses for the subdivision lots and the volumes allocated in the predetermination letter define the amount of
7 water allowed without a permit under the exception under this subsection (4) and will count toward the
8 maximum cumulative volume limit in subsection (4)(a)(v)(A)(IV).
9 (b) (i) The water appropriated under subsection (4)(a)(v) must be measured and reported annually
10 to the department. A totalizing metering device must be used and the measurements must be reported annually
11 on a form provided by the department.
12 (ii) An appropriation exceeding the amounts or conditions in subsection (4)(a)(v) requires a permit.
13 (b) (c) (i) Within 60 days of completion of the well or developed spring and appropriation of the ground
14 water for beneficial use, the appropriator shall file a notice of completion with the department on a form
15 provided by the department through its offices.
16 (ii) Upon receipt of the notice, the department shall review the notice and may, before issuing a
17 certificate of water right, return a defective notice for correction or completion, together with the reasons for
18 returning it. A notice does not lose priority of filing because of defects if the notice is corrected, completed, and
19 refiled with the department within 30 days of notification of defects or within a further time as the department
20 may allow, not to exceed 6 months.
21 (iii) If a notice is not corrected and completed within the time allowed, the priority date of
22 appropriation is the date of refiling a correct and complete notice with the department.
23 (c) (d) A certificate of water right may not be issued until a correct and complete notice has been filed
24 with the department, including proof of landowner notification or a written federal special use authorization as
25 necessary under subsection (1). The original of the certificate must be sent to the appropriator. The department
26 shall keep a copy of the certificate in its office in Helena. The date of filing of the notice of completion is the date
27 of priority of the right.

18 force prior to April 14, 1981, with the county clerk and recorder shall file a notice of completion, as provided in
19 subsection (3) (4), with the department to perfect the water right. The filing of a claim pursuant to 85-2-221 is
20 sufficient notice of completion under this subsection. The priority date of the appropriation is the date of the
21 filing of a notice, as provided in subsection (3) (4), or the date of the filing of the claim of existing water right.
22 (5) (6) An appropriation under subsection (4) (5) is an existing right, and a permit is not required.
23 However, the department shall acknowledge the receipt of a correct and complete filing of a notice of
24 completion, except that for an appropriation of 35 gallons a minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet a year,
25 the department shall issue a certificate of water right. If a certificate is issued under this section, a certificate
26 need not be issued under the adjudication proceedings provided for in 85-2-236.

2 (b) the appropriation is less than 30 acre-feet a year;
3 (c) the appropriation is from an ephemeral stream, an intermittent stream, or another source other
4 than a perennial flowing stream; and
5 (d) the impoundment or pit is to be constructed on and will be accessible to a parcel of land that is
6 owned or under the control of the applicant and that is 40 acres or larger.
7 (7) (8) (a) Within 60 days after constructing an impoundment or pit, the appropriator shall apply for a
8 permit as prescribed by this part. Subject to subsection (7)(b) (8)(b), upon receipt of a correct and complete
9 application for a stock water provisional permit, the department shall automatically issue a provisional permit. If
10 the department determines after a hearing that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely
11 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
12 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
13 of other appropriators.
14 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
15 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
16 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
17 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
18 (c) The purpose of use authorized for a provisional permit pursuant to subsection (9) may not be
19 changed pursuant to 85-2-402.
20 (8) (9) A person may also appropriate water without applying for or prior to receiving a permit under
21 rules adopted by the department under 85-2-113.

25 Section 4. Section 85-2-381, MCA, is amended to read:
26 "85-2-381. Water right enforcement of ground water uses exempt from permitting -- findings
27 and purpose. (1) The legislature finds that:
28 (a) the state of Montana has managed the allocation of water under the prior appropriation
- 9 - LC 4169
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 4169
1 doctrine for more than 100 years;
2 (b) Article IX, section 3, of the Montana constitution recognizes and confirms all existing water
3 rights;
4 (c) the right to the use of water through a water right is a recognized property right;
5 (d) the development of ground water wells that are exempt from permitting may have an adverse
6 effect on other water rights;
7 (e) the Water Use Act requires the department to coordinate the development and use of the water
8 resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources; and
9 (f) the ability to develop ground water wells that are exempt from permitting contributes to the full
10 utilization of the water resources of the state.
11 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
12 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
13 surface water rights.
14 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
15 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
16 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
17 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
18 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
19 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
20 enforcement according to priority by:
21 (a) any remedy legally available;
22 (b) the department, upon receiving a complaint, through the provisions of 85-2-114 and 85-2-122;
23 or
24 (c) a water commissioner appointed pursuant to 85-5-101.
25 (5) For each certificate issued pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) after October 1, 2013, the department
26 shall include written notice of the provisions of this section."

- 15 - LC 4169
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 4169
1 (A) that the ground water level is declining or is projected to decline due to pumping based on a 6-
2 year period of review, which demonstrates a chronic lowering of the ground water table or permanent loss of
3 aquifer storage. This review must be based on available data or consultation with the bureau or other relevant
4 agencies.
5 (B) that 80% or more of the ground water in the aquifer has been appropriated; or
6 (C) that 100% or more of the legally available hydraulically connected surface water has been
7 appropriated during any month. Ground water that is hydrologically connected to surface water is all ground
8 water that, if extracted, may cause stream depletion by induced filtration or pre-stream capture of tributary
9 water.
10 (iii) a study conducted under the ground water investigation program established in 2-15-1523
11 determines that groundwater withdrawals will result in a measurable net depletion of surface water, resulting in
12 adverse effects to prior appropriators.

2 (v) requiring other control provisions the department determines are appropriate and adopts
3 through rulemaking.
4 (9) (a) The department shall designate or modify a water quantity ground water monitoring area by
5 rule if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a high concentration of ground water exempt
6 from permitting pursuant to 85-2-306(4) and the department:
7 (i) determines the ground water level is declining or is projected to decline due to pumping based
8 on a review of the most recent 10-year period of record that demonstrates a chronic lowering of the ground
9 water table or permanent loss of aquifer storage. This review must be based on available data or in consultation
10 with the bureau or other relevant agencies.
11 (ii) determines that 70% or more of the ground water in the aquifer has been appropriated;
12 (iii) determines that aquifer recharge is reliant on irrigation losses or where the geologic structure
13 or formation has limited storage or limited storage potential based on available data or in consultation with the
14 bureau or other relevant agencies; or
15 (iv) determines that 90% or more of the hydraulically connected surface water has been
16 appropriated during any month.
17 (b) (i) Control provisions for water quantity ground water monitoring areas must include but are not
18 limited to:
19 (A) requiring the department to develop a monitoring plan for each designated ground water
20 monitoring area in consultation with the bureau or other relevant agencies; and
21 (B) requiring metering and reporting for all new water rights and authorizations issued pursuant to
22 85-2-311, 85-2-306, and 85-2-402 in water quantity ground water monitoring areas. A totalizing metering device
23 must be used, and the measurements must be reported annually to the department on a form provided by the
24 department.

1 (IV) the cumulative volume of water for the tract of record described in subsection (4)(a)(v)(A)(I)
2 does not exceed a total of 24 acre-feet a year; or
3 (B) if the parcel was divided from a tract of record as defined in 76-3-103 and in existence on or
4 before October 17, 2014, and received a certificate of subdivision approval from the department of
5 environmental quality and a predetermination letter from the department before February 14, 2024, then the
6 water uses for the subdivision lots and the volumes allocated in the predetermination letter define the amount of
7 water allowed without a permit under the exception under this subsection (4) and will count toward the
8 maximum cumulative volume limit in subsection (4)(a)(v)(A)(IV).
9 (b) (i) The water appropriated under subsection (4)(a)(v) must be measured and reported annually
10 to the department. A totalizing metering device must be used and the measurements must be reported annually
11 on a form provided by the department.
12 (ii) An appropriation exceeding the amounts or conditions in subsection (4)(a)(v) requires a permit.
13 (b) (c) (i) Within 60 days of completion of the well or developed spring and appropriation of the ground
14 water for beneficial use, the appropriator shall file a notice of completion with the department on a form
15 provided by the department through its offices.
16 (ii) Upon receipt of the notice, the department shall review the notice and may, before issuing a
17 certificate of water right, return a defective notice for correction or completion, together with the reasons for
18 returning it. A notice does not lose priority of filing because of defects if the notice is corrected, completed, and
19 refiled with the department within 30 days of notification of defects or within a further time as the department
20 may allow, not to exceed 6 months.
21 (iii) If a notice is not corrected and completed within the time allowed, the priority date of
22 appropriation is the date of refiling a correct and complete notice with the department.
23 (c) (d) A certificate of water right may not be issued until a correct and complete notice has been filed
24 with the department, including proof of landowner notification or a written federal special use authorization as
25 necessary under subsection (1). The original of the certificate must be sent to the appropriator. The department
26 shall keep a copy of the certificate in its office in Helena. The date of filing of the notice of completion is the date
27 of priority of the right.

2 (ii) The department shall allocate a volume of 10 acre-feet a year to the system and issue a
3 certificate of water right after the conditions in subsection (3)(d)(i) (4)(e)(i) are met.
4 (iii) The department shall consider a water right as perfected after the conditions in subsection
5 (3)(d)(i) (4)(e)(i) are met.
6 (iv) When the appropriation is for a water supply system that is subject to Title 75, chapter 6, part 1,
7 and is located outside of a stream depletion zone and does not exceed 10 acre-feet a year:
8 (A) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b)(i) (4)(c)(i), the appropriation will be considered perfected
9 upon completion of construction of the water supply system.
10 (B) A copy of the department of environmental quality approval for the water supply system must
11 be submitted with the notice of completion. This section does not preclude the public water supply developer or
12 any subsequent owners from expanding the water system or from revising the water use restrictions within the
13 subdivision, provided that the total amount does not exceed 10 acre-feet per year.
14 (C) Water appropriated under this exception must be measured and reported annually to the
15 department.
16 (4) (5) An appropriator of ground water by means of a well or developed spring first put to beneficial
17 use between January 1, 1962, and July 1, 1973, who did not file a notice of completion, as required by laws in
18 force prior to April 14, 1981, with the county clerk and recorder shall file a notice of completion, as provided in
19 subsection (3) (4), with the department to perfect the water right. The filing of a claim pursuant to 85-2-221 is
20 sufficient notice of completion under this subsection. The priority date of the appropriation is the date of the
21 filing of a notice, as provided in subsection (3) (4), or the date of the filing of the claim of existing water right.
22 (5) (6) An appropriation under subsection (4) (5) is an existing right, and a permit is not required.
23 However, the department shall acknowledge the receipt of a correct and complete filing of a notice of
24 completion, except that for an appropriation of 35 gallons a minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet a year,
25 the department shall issue a certificate of water right. If a certificate is issued under this section, a certificate
26 need not be issued under the adjudication proceedings provided for in 85-2-236.

1 (a) the maximum capacity of the impoundment or pit is less than 15 acre-feet;
2 (b) the appropriation is less than 30 acre-feet a year;
3 (c) the appropriation is from an ephemeral stream, an intermittent stream, or another source other
4 than a perennial flowing stream; and
5 (d) the impoundment or pit is to be constructed on and will be accessible to a parcel of land that is
6 owned or under the control of the applicant and that is 40 acres or larger.
7 (7) (8) (a) Within 60 days after constructing an impoundment or pit, the appropriator shall apply for a
8 permit as prescribed by this part. Subject to subsection (7)(b) (8)(b), upon receipt of a correct and complete
9 application for a stock water provisional permit, the department shall automatically issue a provisional permit. If
10 the department determines after a hearing that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely
11 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
12 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
13 of other appropriators.
14 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
15 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
16 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
17 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
18 (c) The purpose of use authorized for a provisional permit pursuant to subsection (9) may not be
19 changed pursuant to 85-2-402.

26 "85-2-381. Water right enforcement of ground water uses exempt from permitting -- findings
27 and purpose. (1) The legislature finds that:
28 (a) the state of Montana has managed the allocation of water under the prior appropriation
- 9 - LC 4169

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 4169
1 doctrine for more than 100 years;
2 (b) Article IX, section 3, of the Montana constitution recognizes and confirms all existing water
3 rights;
4 (c) the right to the use of water through a water right is a recognized property right;
5 (d) the development of ground water wells that are exempt from permitting may have an adverse
6 effect on other water rights;
7 (e) the Water Use Act requires the department to coordinate the development and use of the water
8 resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources; and
9 (f) the ability to develop ground water wells that are exempt from permitting contributes to the full
10 utilization of the water resources of the state.
11 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
12 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
13 surface water rights.
14 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
15 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
16 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
17 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
18 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
19 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
20 enforcement according to priority by:
21 (a) any remedy legally available;
22 (b) the department, upon receiving a complaint, through the provisions of 85-2-114 and 85-2-122;
23 or
24 (c) a water commissioner appointed pursuant to 85-5-101.
25 (5) For each certificate issued pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) after October 1, 2013, the department
