harm to the person or to others or who appears to have a mental disorder and to be substantially unable to
provide for the person's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety into custody only for
sufficient time to contact a professional person for emergency evaluation. If possible, a professional person
should be called prior to taking the person into custody.
(2) If Except as provided in subsection (5), if the professional person agrees that the person
detained is a danger to the person or to others and that an emergency situation as defined in 53-21-102 exists,
then the person may be detained and treated until the next regular business day. At that time, the professional
person shall release the detained person or file findings with the county attorney who, if the county attorney
determines probable cause to exist, shall file the petition provided for in 53-21-121 through 53-21-126 in the
county of the respondent's residence. In either case, the professional person shall file a report with the court
explaining the professional person's actions.
(3) The county attorney of a county may make arrangements with a federal, state, regional, or
private mental facility or with a mental health facility in a county for the detention of persons held pursuant to
this section. If an arrangement has been made with a facility that does not, at the time of the emergency, have
a bed available to detain the person at that facility, the person may be transported to the state hospital or to a
behavioral health inpatient facility, subject to 53-21-193 and subsection (4) of this section, for detention and
treatment as provided in this part. This determination must be made on an individual basis in each case, and
the professional person at the local facility shall certify to the county attorney that the facility does not have
adequate room at that time.
(4) Before a person may be transferred to the state hospital or to a behavioral health inpatient
facility under this section, the state hospital or the behavioral health inpatient facility must be notified prior to
transfer and shall state whether a bed is available for the person. If the professional person determines that a
behavioral health inpatient facility is the appropriate facility for the emergency detention and a bed is available,
the county attorney shall direct the person to the appropriate facility to which the person must be transported for
emergency detention.
(5) If the professional person determines that the person meets the requirements for a 72-hour
mental health hold prescribed in [section 1], then the requirements of [section 1] apply."

Section 5:
Section 4. Section 53-21-132, MCA, is amended to read:
"53-21-132. Cost of examination and commitment. (1) The cost of psychiatric precommitment
examination, detention, treatment, and taking a person who is suffering from a mental disorder and who
requires commitment to a mental health facility must be paid pursuant to subsection (2)(a). The sheriff must be

involuntary commitment proceeding by a professional person acting pursuant to 53-21-123 must be billed to the
following entities in the listed order of priority:
(i) the respondent, the parent or guardian of a respondent who is a minor, or the respondent's

service by a public assistance program.
(b) The county of residence is not required to pay costs of treatment and custody of the
respondent after the respondent is committed pursuant to this part. Precommitment costs related to the use of
two-way electronic audio-video communication in the county of commitment must be paid by the county in
which the person resides at the time that the person is committed. The costs of the use of two-way electronic
audio-video communication from the state hospital for a patient who is under a voluntary or involuntary
commitment to the state hospital must be paid by the state. The fact that a person is examined, hospitalized, or
receives medical, psychological, or other mental health treatment pursuant to this part does not relieve a third
party from a contractual obligation to pay for the cost of the examination, hospitalization, or treatment.
(3) The adult respondent or the parent or guardian of a minor shall pay the cost of treatment and
custody ordered pursuant to 53-21-127, except to the extent that the adult or minor is eligible for public mental
health program funds.
(4) A community service provider that is a private, nonpublic provider may not be required to treat

present at a hearing, as provided in 53-21-115(2) and 53-21-116, is satisfied by:
(a) the respondent's physical appearance before the court; or
(b) in the discretion of the court, by electronic audio-video communication.
(2) For purposes of this chapter, :
(a) electronic audio-video communication must allow all participants to be observed and heard
simultaneously; and
(b) a hearing that is conducted by the use of two-way electronic audio-video communication,

hearing in open court.
(2) Whenever the law requires that a respondent or patient in any of the hearings provided for in
subsection (3) be present before a court, this requirement may, in the discretion of the court, be satisfied either
by the respondent's or patient's physical appearance before the court or by two-way electronic audio-video
communication. The audio-video communication must operate so that the respondent or patient, the
respondent's or patient's counsel, and the judge can see each other simultaneously and converse with each
other, so that the respondent or patient and the respondent's or patient's counsel can communicate privately,
and so that the respondent or patient and counsel are both present during the two-way electronic audio-video
communication. A respondent or patient may request that counsel from the board be present, for consulting
purposes only, if the respondent or patient is located at the state hospital.
(3) At the discretion of the court, the following hearings may be conducted through two-way
electronic audio-video communication:
(a) the initial hearing provided for in 53-21-122;

facility as provided for in 53-21-197;
(g) a hearing on an extension of the conditions of release as provided for in 53-21-198.
(4) This section does not abrogate a person's rights under 53-21-115, 53-21-116, or 53-21-117. A
respondent or patient, the respondent's or patient's counsel, and a friend of respondent or patient, if any, must
be informed of these rights prior to a hearing by two-way electronic audio-video communication in lieu of a
hearing in person. A respondent or patient or the respondent's or patient's counsel and a friend of respondent
or patient, acting together, may waive any of the rights, as provided under 53-21-119.
(5) A two-way electronic audio-video communication may not be used:
(a) in an initial hearing provided for in 53-21-122 if the professional person objects; or
(b) in a hearing referred to in subsections (3)(b) through (3)(g) if a respondent or patient, the
respondent's or patient's counsel, or the professional person objects."
