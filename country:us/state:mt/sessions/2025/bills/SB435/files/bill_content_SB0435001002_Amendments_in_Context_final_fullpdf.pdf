1 "53-21-132. Cost of examination and commitment. (1) The cost of psychiatric precommitment
2 examination, detention, treatment, and taking a person who is suffering from a mental disorder and who
3 requires commitment to a mental health facility must be paid pursuant to subsection (2)(a). The sheriff must be
4 allowed the actual expenses incurred in taking a committed person to the facility, as provided by 7-32-2144.
5 (2) (a) The costs of precommitment psychiatric detention, precommitment psychiatric examination,
6 and precommitment psychiatric treatment of the respondent and any cost associated with testimony during an
7 involuntary commitment proceeding by a professional person acting pursuant to 53-21-123 must be billed to the
8 following entities in the listed order of priority:
9 (i) the respondent, the parent or guardian of a respondent who is a minor, or the respondent's
10 private insurance carrier, if any;
11 (ii) a public assistance program, such as medicaid, for a qualifying respondent; or
12 (iii) the county of residence of the respondent in an amount not to exceed the amount paid for the

19 commitment to the state hospital must be paid by the state. The fact that a person is examined, hospitalized, or
20 receives medical, psychological, or other mental health treatment pursuant to this part does not relieve a third
21 party from a contractual obligation to pay for the cost of the examination, hospitalization, or treatment.
22 (3) The adult respondent or the parent or guardian of a minor shall pay the cost of treatment and
23 custody ordered pursuant to 53-21-127, except to the extent that the adult or minor is eligible for public mental
24 health program funds.

1 Section 4. Section 53-21-140, MCA, is amended to read:
2 "53-21-140. Use of two-way electronic audio-video communication. (1) A respondent's right to be
3 present at a hearing, as provided in 53-21-115(2) and 53-21-116, is satisfied by:
4 (a) the respondent's physical appearance before the court; or
5 (b) in the discretion of the court, by electronic audio-video communication, unless the respondent
6 or patient, the respondent's or patient's counsel, or a professional person objects.
7 (2) For purposes of this chapter, :
8 (a) electronic audio-video communication must allow all participants to be observed and heard
9 simultaneously; and
10 (b) a hearing that is conducted by the use of two-way electronic audio-video communication,
11 allowing all of the participants to be observed and heard by all present simultaneously, is considered to be a
12 hearing in open court.
13 (2) Whenever the law requires that a respondent or patient in any of the hearings provided for in
14 subsection (3) be present before a court, this requirement may, in the discretion of the court, be satisfied either
15 by the respondent's or patient's physical appearance before the court or by two-way electronic audio-video
16 communication. The audio-video communication must operate so that the respondent or patient, the
17 respondent's or patient's counsel, and the judge can see each other simultaneously and converse with each
18 other, so that the respondent or patient and the respondent's or patient's counsel can communicate privately,
19 and so that the respondent or patient and counsel are both present during the two-way electronic audio-video
20 communication. A respondent or patient may request that counsel from the board be present, for consulting
21 purposes only, if the respondent or patient is located at the state hospital.
22 (3) At the discretion of the court, the following hearings may be conducted through two-way
23 electronic audio-video communication:
24 (a) the initial hearing provided for in 53-21-122;
25 (b) the detention hearing provided for in 53-21-124;
26 (c) the trial or hearing on a petition provided for in 53-21-126;

3 facility as provided for in 53-21-197;

6 respondent or patient, the respondent's or patient's counsel, and a friend of respondent or patient, if any, must
7 be informed of these rights prior to a hearing by two-way electronic audio-video communication in lieu of a
8 hearing in person. A respondent or patient or the respondent's or patient's counsel and a friend of respondent
9 or patient, acting together, may waive any of the rights, as provided under 53-21-119.
10 (5) A two-way electronic audio-video communication may not be used:
11 (a) in an initial hearing provided for in 53-21-122 if the professional person objects; or
