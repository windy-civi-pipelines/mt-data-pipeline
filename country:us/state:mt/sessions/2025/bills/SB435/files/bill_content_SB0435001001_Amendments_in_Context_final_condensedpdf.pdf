1 "53-21-129. Emergency situation -- petition -- detention -- exception. (1) When an emergency
2 situation as defined in 53-21-102 exists, a peace officer or emergency care provider as defined in 50-6-202 may
3 take any person who appears to have a mental disorder and to present an imminent danger of death or bodily
4 harm to the person or to others or who appears to have a mental disorder and to be substantially unable to
5 provide for the person's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety into custody only for
6 sufficient time to contact a professional person for emergency evaluation. If possible, a professional person
7 should be called prior to taking the person into custody.
8 (2) If Except as provided in subsection (5), if the professional person agrees that the person
9 detained is a danger to the person or to others and that an emergency situation as defined in 53-21-102 exists,
10 then the person may be detained and treated until the next regular business day. At that time, the professional
11 person shall release the detained person or file findings with the county attorney who, if the county attorney
12 determines probable cause to exist, shall file the petition provided for in 53-21-121 through 53-21-126 in the
13 county of the respondent's residence. In either case, the professional person shall file a report with the court
14 explaining the professional person's actions.
15 (3) The county attorney of a county may make arrangements with a federal, state, regional, or
16 private mental facility or with a mental health facility in a county for the detention of persons held pursuant to
17 this section. If an arrangement has been made with a facility that does not, at the time of the emergency, have
18 a bed available to detain the person at that facility, the person may be transported to the state hospital or to a
19 behavioral health inpatient facility, subject to 53-21-193 and subsection (4) of this section, for detention and
20 treatment as provided in this part. This determination must be made on an individual basis in each case, and

24 facility under this section, the state hospital or the behavioral health inpatient facility must be notified prior to
25 transfer and shall state whether a bed is available for the person. If the professional person determines that a
26 behavioral health inpatient facility is the appropriate facility for the emergency detention and a bed is available,
27 the county attorney shall direct the person to the appropriate facility to which the person must be transported for

5 Section 4. Section 53-21-132, MCA, is amended to read:
6 "53-21-132. Cost of examination and commitment. (1) The cost of psychiatric precommitment
7 examination, detention, treatment, and taking a person who is suffering from a mental disorder and who
8 requires commitment to a mental health facility must be paid pursuant to subsection (2)(a). The sheriff must be
9 allowed the actual expenses incurred in taking a committed person to the facility, as provided by 7-32-2144.
10 (2) (a) The costs of precommitment psychiatric detention, precommitment psychiatric examination,
11 and precommitment psychiatric treatment of the respondent and any cost associated with testimony during an
12 involuntary commitment proceeding by a professional person acting pursuant to 53-21-123 must be billed to the
13 following entities in the listed order of priority:
14 (i) the respondent, the parent or guardian of a respondent who is a minor, or the respondent's
15 private insurance carrier, if any;
16 (ii) a public assistance program, such as medicaid, for a qualifying respondent; or
17 (iii) the county of residence of the respondent in an amount not to exceed the amount paid for the
18 service by a public assistance program.
19 (b) The county of residence is not required to pay costs of treatment and custody of the
20 respondent after the respondent is committed pursuant to this part. Precommitment costs related to the use of
21 two-way electronic audio-video communication in the county of commitment must be paid by the county in
22 which the person resides at the time that the person is committed. The costs of the use of two-way electronic
23 audio-video communication from the state hospital for a patient who is under a voluntary or involuntary
24 commitment to the state hospital must be paid by the state. The fact that a person is examined, hospitalized, or
25 receives medical, psychological, or other mental health treatment pursuant to this part does not relieve a third
26 party from a contractual obligation to pay for the cost of the examination, hospitalization, or treatment.
27 (3) The adult respondent or the parent or guardian of a minor shall pay the cost of treatment and
