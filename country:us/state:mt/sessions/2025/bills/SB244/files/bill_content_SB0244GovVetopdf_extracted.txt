Dear Governor Gianforte:
of Montana Benefit Plan (State Plan), which insures nearly 30,000 employees, legislators,
retirees, and their dependents. The State Plan is funded by both taxpayer dollars, also known
as the State Share, and employee contributions. Under your administration, through good
stewardship and strong financial management of the funds entrusted to us, we have been
able to achieve significant cost savings with the State Plan. During this session, however, the
69th Legislature approved several bills that will increase costs, reduce reserves, and
threaten the progress we have made.
One of those bills, Senate Bill 244 (SB 244), requires insurance companies and the State Plan
to cover the cost of providing behavioral health screenings at no out-of-pocket cost to the
insured or plan member. If SB 244 is enacted, the State Plan will incur an additional
$160,000-$200,000 in annual costs to provide behavioral health screenings to plan
members without a fee.
Typically, the State Share and employee contributions to the State Plan are a major focus of
collective bargaining with state employees and the unions who represent them. Prior to
session, the state and unions negotiated and agreed to the State Share amount and
indirectly, the employee contributions that were ultimately included in House Bill 13 (HB 13).
With your encouragement, HB 13 received broad, bipartisan support from the Legislature
and you signed it into law earlier this year.
During negotiations with employees, there was no indication they wanted the State Plan to
cover behavioral health screenings with no out-of-pocket cost sharing. Thus, no funding was
included in the state’s budget or HB 13 to pay for behavioral health screenings with no out-
of-pocket cost to plan members. Although the additional cost of behavioral health
screenings to the State Plan was noted in the fiscal note for SB 244, no appropriation was
included to offset the expense.
As a result, the costs associated with SB 244 will be paid from and deplete the State Plan’s
reserve funds. This will add to the likelihood that the state will need to increase the amount
of tax dollars used to support the State Plan (the State Share), negotiate with employees to
increase their contributions to the State Plan, or agree to a reduction in other benefits offered
under the State Plan.
Alternatively, if you chose to exercise your power to veto SB 244, this issue could be subject
to negotiations with state employees prior to the next session, included in that session’s pay
plan bill, or brought forward in a standalone bill that includes the funding necessary to
provide behavioral health screenings without plan member cost sharing. In the meantime,
we would encourage plan members to access the generous behavioral health benefits
already provided through the plan, including integrated primary and behavioral health
services available at the Montana Health Centers, wellness programs and workshops,
substance use coverage, and the robust benefits available through our comprehensive
Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Many of these services are available at no cost to the
plan member and some services can be accessed virtually for plan members who reside in
remote locations.
Given the extensive coverage and options already available through the state plan, and in the
spirit of financial responsibility that has guided our efforts to keep a lid on health plan
increases, we respectfully request that you carefully consider whether SB 244’s mandated
coverage is aligned with your goal to carefully and conservatively manage state finances.
Sincerely,
Misty Ann Giles
Director
