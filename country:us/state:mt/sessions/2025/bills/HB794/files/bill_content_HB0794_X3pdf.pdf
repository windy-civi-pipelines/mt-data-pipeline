equivalent of the brand-name drug prescribed by the physician, unless the generic-name drug is unavailable.
(2) If an injured worker prefers a brand-name drug, the worker may pay directly to the pharmacist
the difference in the reimbursement rate between the brand-name drug and the generic-name product, and the
pharmacist may bill the insurer only for the reimbursement rate of the generic-name drug.
(3) The pharmacist may bill only for the cost of the generic-name product on a signed itemized

Interest on account balances accrues to the account. The purpose of the account is to:
(a) reimburse participating retail pharmacies for the secondary discounted price; and
(b) reimburse the department for contracted services, administrative costs, associated computer
costs, professional fees paid to participating retail pharmacies, pharmacy benefit administrators, and other
reasonable program costs.
(3) The department shall provide for sufficient personnel to ensure efficient administration of the
program. The extent and the magnitude of the program must be determined by the department on the basis of
the calculated need of the recipient population and available funds. The department may not spend more on
this program than is available through appropriations, federal or other grants, and other established and
committed funding sources. The department may accept, for the purposes of carrying out this program, federal
funds appropriated under any federal law relating to the furnishing of free or low-cost drugs to disadvantaged,
elderly, and disabled individuals, may take action that is necessary for the purposes of carrying out that federal
law, and may accept from any other agency of government, individual, group, or corporation funds that may be
available to carry out this part.
(4) The department may adopt rules relating to the conduct of this program.
(5) The department shall, if the department determines that sufficient funds are available, adopt

may establish a secondary discounted price to encourage the use of generic drugs over higher-cost brand-
name drugs.
(6) The department shall establish by rule eligibility based upon the applicant's family income as
provided in 53-6-1003. The total income may not exceed 250% of the federal poverty level. The department
may adopt rules defining income. In establishing eligibility based upon income, the department shall take into
account the amount of funding available for the program. The department shall issue enrollment materials to
eligible individuals.
(7) Establishment of the program is contingent upon compliance with all applicable federal laws.
The department may adopt rules necessary to implement conditions required by federal law.
(8) If program costs are expected to exceed the legislative authorization for the program, the
department shall adjust discounted prices or eligibility standards to maintain the program within the available

funding.

(10) (a) The department may not contract with either an in-state or out-of-state mail service order
pharmacy, as defined in 37-7-702, for the purposes of the program for at least 1 year after persons eligible for
the program have begun to purchase drugs through the program. At that time, the department shall evaluate
the number of pharmacies within the state providing prescription drugs as part of the program.
(b) If the department determines that there are insufficient pharmacies participating in the program
to allow reasonable access to persons qualified to purchase prescription drugs through the program, it may,
after the evaluation provided for in subsection (10)(a), use one or more in-state or out-of-state mail service
order pharmacies, or both, for the purposes of the program."
