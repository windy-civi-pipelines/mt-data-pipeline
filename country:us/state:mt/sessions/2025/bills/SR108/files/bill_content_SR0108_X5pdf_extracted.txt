Section 1:
69th Legislature 2025 SR 108
2025, AS TWO LIGHTS FOR TOMORROW WEEK IN MONTANA.
WHEREAS, the Montana Senate recognizes the importance of honoring and commemorating the 250th
anniversary of the founding of our nation and reminding our citizens of the vital significance and relevance of
our founding principles and ideals that created a unique national identity worth fighting for; and
WHEREAS, the events of 1775 that began the revolution the year before independence was declared
are significant moments that signaled the creation of a national identity and unity of purpose that transcended
traditional geographic, cultural, and societal divides; and
WHEREAS, individuals and communities across all of the colonies came together to support their
fellow countrymen; and
WHEREAS, on the evening of April 18, 1775, with impending hostile action from the British army in
Boston, Massachusetts, Paul Revere and William Dawes, along with other alarm riders, undertook a perilous
ride to alert everyone in the countryside of the coming danger; and
WHEREAS, preceding their departure from Boston, a prearranged signal was set in the Old North
Church steeple to ensure that the message got out and did not solely rely on just one or two alarm riders; and
WHEREAS, the two lanterns that were the signal were immortalized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's
poem "Paul Revere's Ride" as "one if by land, and two if by sea" and have become an enduring symbol of
American vigilance, perseverance, and preparedness in the face of adversity; and
WHEREAS, those alarm riders and the citizens who answered the call to arms to serve and defend
their fellow countrymen that night and the following day at the battles of Lexington and Concord exemplify the
spirit of community and shared responsibility that has defined our nation since its inception; and
WHEREAS, we are reminded, 250 years later, that the call for unity and the call to serve each other is

ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature 2025 SR 108
no less relevant today than it was in 1775; and
WHEREAS, a national initiative has been proposed that two lights be displayed in public spaces across
the country for all to see, marking that significant anniversary in April 2025 and the beginning of the 250th
anniversary commemorations leading up to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July
4, 2026; and
WHEREAS, state commissions, state governments, federal agencies, and community, heritage, and
historical organizations across the country, including the Montana 250th Commission, have eagerly endorsed
the initiative, have pledged to support it and participate in it, and have encouraged others to do the same; and
WHEREAS, some participating agencies have also pledged to encourage a day of community service
on April 19, 2025, as a way to encourage understanding about the true meaning of these historical
commemorations, knowing that these events are not just marking history for history's sake but rather
encouraging reflection on the idea that all of these historic events were endeavoring toward one common goal:
the chance for a better tomorrow, together.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the Montana Senate proclaims the week of April 14, 2025, as Two Lights for Tomorrow Week and
calls on all citizens to unite in remembrance of our shared history, honoring the sacrifices made by those who
fought for our independence and reminding ourselves of the values we hold dear today.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Montana Senate encourages all government buildings,
community centers, museums, public spaces, historic preservation entities, and citizens to take part in this
symbolic commemoration by prominently displaying two lights for all to see during the night of April 18, 2025,
and to reflect on how those lights shining out in the darkness during this vigil symbolically illustrate our ongoing
journey as a nation.
