5 2025, AS TWO LIGHTS FOR TOMORROW WEEK IN MONTANA.
6
7 WHEREAS, the Montana Senate recognizes the importance of honoring and commemorating the 250th
8 anniversary of the founding of our nation and reminding our citizens of the vital significance and relevance of
9 our founding principles and ideals that created a unique national identity worth fighting for; and
10 WHEREAS, the events of 1775 that began the revolution the year before independence was declared
11 are significant moments that signaled the creation of a national identity and unity of purpose that transcended
12 traditional geographic, cultural, and societal divides; and
13 WHEREAS, individuals and communities across all of the colonies came together to support their
14 fellow countrymen; and
15 WHEREAS, on the evening of April 18, 1775, with impending hostile action from the British army in
16 Boston, Massachusetts, Paul Revere and William Dawes, along with other alarm riders, undertook a perilous
17 ride to alert everyone in the countryside of the coming danger; and
18 WHEREAS, preceding their departure from Boston, a prearranged signal was set in the Old North
19 Church steeple to ensure that the message got out and did not solely rely on just one or two alarm riders; and
20 WHEREAS, the two lanterns that were the signal were immortalized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's
21 poem "Paul Revere's Ride" as "one if by land, and two if by sea" and have become an enduring symbol of
22 American vigilance, perseverance, and preparedness in the face of adversity; and
23 WHEREAS, those alarm riders and the citizens who answered the call to arms to serve and defend
24 their fellow countrymen that night and the following day at the battles of Lexington and Concord exemplify the
25 spirit of community and shared responsibility that has defined our nation since its inception; and
26 WHEREAS, we are reminded, 250 years later, that the call for unity and the call to serve each other is
27 no less relevant today than it was in 1775; and
28 WHEREAS, a national initiative has been proposed that two lights be displayed in public spaces across
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – SR 108
69th Legislature 2025 SR 108.1
1 the country for all to see, marking that significant anniversary in April 2025 and the beginning of the 250th
2 anniversary commemorations leading up to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July
3 4, 2026; and
4 WHEREAS, state commissions, state governments, federal agencies, and community, heritage, and
5 historical organizations across the country, including the Montana 250th Commission, have eagerly endorsed
6 the initiative, have pledged to support it and participate in it, and have encouraged others to do the same; and
7 WHEREAS, some participating agencies have also pledged to encourage a day of community service
8 on April 19, 2025, as a way to encourage understanding about the true meaning of these historical
9 commemorations, knowing that these events are not just marking history for history's sake but rather
10 encouraging reflection on the idea that all of these historic events were endeavoring toward one common goal:
11 the chance for a better tomorrow, together.
12
13 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
14 That the Montana Senate proclaims the week of April 14, 2025, as Two Lights for Tomorrow Week and
15 calls on all citizens to unite in remembrance of our shared history, honoring the sacrifices made by those who
16 fought for our independence and reminding ourselves of the values we hold dear today.
17 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Montana Senate encourages all government buildings,
18 community centers, museums, public spaces, historic preservation entities, and citizens to take part in this
19 symbolic commemoration by prominently displaying two lights for all to see during the night of April 18, 2025,
20 and to reflect on how those lights shining out in the darkness during this vigil symbolically illustrate our ongoing
21 journey as a nation.
