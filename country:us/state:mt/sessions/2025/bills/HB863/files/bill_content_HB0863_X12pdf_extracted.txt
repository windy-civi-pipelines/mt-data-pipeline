tax under this chapter, except farmers or ranchers as defined in subsection (6), shall pay for the tax year,
through employer withholding, as provided in 15-30-2502, through payment of estimated tax in four
installments, as provided in subsection (2) of this section, or through a combination of employer withholding and
estimated tax payments, at least:
(i) 90% of the tax for the current tax year, less tax credits and withholding allowed the taxpayer; or
(ii) an amount equal to 100% of the individual's tax liability for the preceding tax year, if the
preceding tax year was a period of 12 months and if the individual filed a return for the tax year.
(b) Payment of estimated taxes under this section is not required if:
(i) the combined tax liability of employer withholding and estimated tax for the current year is less
than $500 after reductions for credits and withholding;
(ii) the individual did not have any tax liability for the preceding tax year, which was a tax year of
12 months, and if the individual was a citizen or resident of the United States throughout that tax year;
(iii) the underpayment was caused by reason of casualty, disaster, or other unusual circumstances
that the department determines to constitute good cause; or
(iv) the individual retired in the tax year after having attained the age of 62 or if the individual
became disabled in the tax year. In addition, payment of estimated taxes under this section is not required in
the tax year following the tax year in which the individual retired or became disabled.

Fourth 15th day of the month following the close of the tax year
(3) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4), each installment must be 25% of the required annual
payment determined pursuant to subsection (1). If the taxpayer's tax situation changes, each succeeding
installment must be proportionally changed so that the balance of the required annual payment is paid in equal
installments over the remaining period of time.
(b) If the taxpayer's tax situation changes after the date for the first installment or any subsequent
installment, as specified in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), so that the taxpayer is required to pay estimated taxes,
the taxpayer shall pay 25% for each succeeding installment except for the first one in which a payment is
required. For estimated taxes required to be paid beginning with the second installment provided for in
subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), the taxpayer shall pay 50% for that installment and 25% for the third and fourth
installments, respectively. For estimated taxes required to be paid beginning with the third installment provided
for in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), the taxpayer shall pay 75% for that installment and 25% for the fourth
installment.
(4) (a) If for any required installment the taxpayer determines that the installment payment is less
than the amount determined under subsection (3)(a), the lower amount may be paid as an annualized income
installment.
(b) For any required installment, the annualized income installment is the applicable percentage
described in subsection (4)(c) applied to the tax computed on the basis of annualized Montana taxable income
in the tax year for the months ending before the due date for the installment less the total amount of any prior
required installments for the tax year.

Fourth 90%
(d) A reduction in a required installment resulting from the application of an annualized income
installment must be recaptured by increasing the amount of the next required installment, determined under
subsection (3)(a), by the amount of the reduction. Any subsequent installment must be increased by the
amount of the reduction until the amount has been recaptured.
(5) (a) Subject to subsection (5)(e), if an estimated tax, an employer withholding tax, or a
combination of estimated tax and employer withholding tax is underpaid, there must be added to the amount
due under this chapter interest on the amount of the underpayment as provided in 15-1-216. The interest is
computed on the amount of the underpayment, as determined in subsection (5)(b), for the period from the time
the payment was due to the date payment was made or to the 15th day of the 4th month of the year following
the tax year in which the payment was to be made, whichever is earlier.
(b) For the purpose of determining the amount of interest due in subsection (5)(a), the amount of
the underpayment is the required installment amount less the installment amount paid, if any, on or before the
due date for the installment.
(c) For the purpose of determining the amount of interest due in subsection (5)(a), an estimated
payment must be credited against unpaid required installments in the order in which those installments are
required to be paid.
(d) Interest may not be charged with respect to any underpayment of the fourth installment of
estimated taxes if:
(i) the taxpayer pays in full the amount computed on the return as payable; and
(ii) the taxpayer files a return on or before the last day of the month following the close of the tax
year referred to in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b).

(e) Interest on the underpayment of estimated tax may not be assessed against a taxpayer if the
tax paid by the taxpayer from employer withholding and estimated tax payments satisfies the requirements of
subsection (1)(a)(i) or (1)(a)(ii) and the taxpayer has paid approximately equal quarterly installments of
estimated taxes.
(6) For the purposes of this section, "farmer or rancher" means a taxpayer who derives at least
66&#8201;2/3% of the taxpayer's gross income, determined for federal income tax purposes, from farming or
ranching operations, or both.
(7) The department shall promulgate rules governing reasonable extensions of time for paying the
estimated tax. An extension may not be for more than 6 months.
(8) (a) Notwithstanding 15-1-206(2), the department may, in its discretion, waive the interest
required to be added under subsection (5), for underpaid estimated taxes attributable to the 2024 tax year, if
the taxpayer:
(i) timely files a Montana income tax return for the 2024 income tax year, as provided in 15-3024

Section 2. Section 15-30-2512, MCA, is amended to read:
"15-30-2512. Estimated tax -- payment -- exceptions -- interest. (1) (a) Each individual subject to
tax under this chapter, except farmers or ranchers as defined in subsection (6), shall pay for the tax year,
through employer withholding, as provided in 15-30-2502, through payment of estimated tax in four
installments, as provided in subsection (2) of this section, or through a combination of employer withholding and
estimated tax payments, at least:
(i) 90% of the tax for the current tax year, less tax credits and withholding allowed the taxpayer; or
(ii) an amount equal to 100% of the individual's tax liability for the preceding tax year, if the
preceding tax year was a period of 12 months and if the individual filed a return for the tax year.
(b) Payment of estimated taxes under this section is not required if:
(i) the combined tax liability of employer withholding and estimated tax for the current year is less
than $500 after reductions for credits and withholding;
(ii) the individual did not have any tax liability for the preceding tax year, which was a tax year of

that the department determines to constitute good cause; or
(iv) the individual retired in the tax year after having attained the age of 62 or if the individual
became disabled in the tax year. In addition, payment of estimated taxes under this section is not required in
the tax year following the tax year in which the individual retired or became disabled.
(2) Estimated taxes must be paid in four installments according to one of the following schedules:
(a) Subject to the due date provision in 15-30-2604(1)(b), for each taxpayer whose tax year begins

69th Legislature 2025 HB 863
Third September 15
Fourth January 15 of the following tax year
(b) Subject to the due date provision in 15-30-2604(1)(b), for each taxpayer whose tax year begins
on a date other than January 1, estimated tax payments are due on the following dates:
Installment Date
First 15th day of the 4th month following the beginning of the tax year
Second 15th day of the 6th month following the beginning of the tax year
Third 15th day of the 9th month following the beginning of the tax year
Fourth 15th day of the month following the close of the tax year
(3) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4), each installment must be 25% of the required annual
payment determined pursuant to subsection (1). If the taxpayer's tax situation changes, each succeeding
installment must be proportionally changed so that the balance of the required annual payment is paid in equal
installments over the remaining period of time.
(b) If the taxpayer's tax situation changes after the date for the first installment or any subsequent
installment, as specified in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), so that the taxpayer is required to pay estimated taxes,
the taxpayer shall pay 25% for each succeeding installment except for the first one in which a payment is
required. For estimated taxes required to be paid beginning with the second installment provided for in
subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), the taxpayer shall pay 50% for that installment and 25% for the third and fourth
installments, respectively. For estimated taxes required to be paid beginning with the third installment provided
for in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), the taxpayer shall pay 75% for that installment and 25% for the fourth
installment.
(4) (a) If for any required installment the taxpayer determines that the installment payment is less
than the amount determined under subsection (3)(a), the lower amount may be paid as an annualized income
installment.
(b) For any required installment, the annualized income installment is the applicable percentage
described in subsection (4)(c) applied to the tax computed on the basis of annualized Montana taxable income
in the tax year for the months ending before the due date for the installment less the total amount of any prior
required installments for the tax year.

(c) For the purposes of this subsection (4), the applicable percentage is determined according to
the following schedule:
Required Installment Applicable Percentage

Second 45%
Third 67.5%
Fourth 90%
(d) A reduction in a required installment resulting from the application of an annualized income
installment must be recaptured by increasing the amount of the next required installment, determined under
subsection (3)(a), by the amount of the reduction. Any subsequent installment must be increased by the
amount of the reduction until the amount has been recaptured.
(5) (a) Subject to subsection (5)(e), if an estimated tax, an employer withholding tax, or a
combination of estimated tax and employer withholding tax is underpaid, there must be added to the amount
due under this chapter interest on the amount of the underpayment as provided in 15-1-216. The interest is
computed on the amount of the underpayment, as determined in subsection (5)(b), for the period from the time
the payment was due to the date payment was made or to the 15th day of the 4th month of the year following
the tax year in which the payment was to be made, whichever is earlier.
(b) For the purpose of determining the amount of interest due in subsection (5)(a), the amount of
the underpayment is the required installment amount less the installment amount paid, if any, on or before the
due date for the installment.
(c) For the purpose of determining the amount of interest due in subsection (5)(a), an estimated
payment must be credited against unpaid required installments in the order in which those installments are
required to be paid.
(d) Interest may not be charged with respect to any underpayment of the fourth installment of
estimated taxes if:
(i) the taxpayer pays in full the amount computed on the return as payable; and
(ii) the taxpayer files a return on or before the last day of the month following the close of the tax
year referred to in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b).

(e) Interest on the underpayment of estimated tax may not be assessed against a taxpayer if the
tax paid by the taxpayer from employer withholding and estimated tax payments satisfies the requirements of
subsection (1)(a)(i) or (1)(a)(ii) and the taxpayer has paid approximately equal quarterly installments of
estimated taxes.
(6) For the purposes of this section, "farmer or rancher" means a taxpayer who derives at least
66&#8201;2/3% of the taxpayer's gross income, determined for federal income tax purposes, from farming or
ranching operations, or both.
(7) The department shall promulgate rules governing reasonable extensions of time for paying the
estimated tax. An extension may not be for more than 6 months.
(8) (a) Notwithstanding 15-1-206(2), the department may, in its discretion, waive the interest
required to be added under subsection (5), for underpaid estimated taxes attributable to the 2024 tax year, if
the taxpayer:
(i) timely files a Montana income tax return for the 2024 income tax year, as provided in 15-3024
2604; and
(ii) when filing the return as provided in subsection (8)(a)(i), pays to the department any balance of

revenue fund to the credit of the department. The department may spend from that account in accordance with
an expenditure appropriation by the legislature based on an estimate of the costs of collecting and disbursing
the proceeds of the tax. Before allocating the balance of the tax proceeds in accordance with the provisions of
17-2-124 and as provided in subsections (2)(a) through (2)(j) (2)(k) of this section, the department shall
determine the expenditures by state agencies for in-state lodging for each reporting period and deduct 4% of
that amount from the tax proceeds received each reporting period. The department shall distribute the portion
of the 4% that was paid with federal funds to the department of administration for return to the federal
