5 on January 1, estimated tax payments are due on the following dates:
Installment Date
First April 15
Second June 15
Third September 15
Fourth January 15 of the following tax year

8 (3) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4), each installment must be 25% of the required annual

16 subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), the taxpayer shall pay 50% for that installment and 25% for the third and fourth
17 installments, respectively. For estimated taxes required to be paid beginning with the third installment provided

2 installment.
3 (4) (a) If for any required installment the taxpayer determines that the installment payment is less
4 than the amount determined under subsection (3)(a), the lower amount may be paid as an annualized income
5 installment.
6 (b) For any required installment, the annualized income installment is the applicable percentage

11 the following schedule:
Required Installment Applicable Percentage
First 22.5%
Second 45%
Third 67.5%
Fourth 90%
12 (d) A reduction in a required installment resulting from the application of an annualized income
13 installment must be recaptured by increasing the amount of the next required installment, determined under
14 subsection (3)(a), by the amount of the reduction. Any subsequent installment must be increased by the
15 amount of the reduction until the amount has been recaptured.
16 (5) (a) Subject to subsection (5)(e), if an estimated tax, an employer withholding tax, or a
17 combination of estimated tax and employer withholding tax is underpaid, there must be added to the amount

21 the tax year in which the payment was to be made, whichever is earlier.
22 (b) For the purpose of determining the amount of interest due in subsection (5)(a), the amount of

1 the underpayment is the required installment amount less the installment amount paid, if any, on or before the
2 due date for the installment.
3 (c) For the purpose of determining the amount of interest due in subsection (5)(a), an estimated
4 payment must be credited against unpaid required installments in the order in which those installments are
5 required to be paid.
6 (d) Interest may not be charged with respect to any underpayment of the fourth installment of
7 estimated taxes if:
8 (i) the taxpayer pays in full the amount computed on the return as payable; and
9 (ii) the taxpayer files a return on or before the last day of the month following the close of the tax
10 year referred to in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b).
11 (e) Interest on the underpayment of estimated tax may not be assessed against a taxpayer if the
12 tax paid by the taxpayer from employer withholding and estimated tax payments satisfies the requirements of
13 subsection (1)(a)(i) or (1)(a)(ii) and the taxpayer has paid approximately equal quarterly installments of
14 estimated taxes.
15 (6) For the purposes of this section, "farmer or rancher" means a taxpayer who derives at least 66
16 2/3% of the taxpayer's gross income, determined for federal income tax purposes, from farming or ranching
17 operations, or both.
18 (7) The department shall promulgate rules governing reasonable extensions of time for paying the
19 estimated tax. An extension may not be for more than 6 months.
20 (8) (a) Notwithstanding 15-1-206(2), the department may, in its discretion, waive the interest
21 required to be added under subsection (5), for underpaid estimated taxes attributable to the 2024 tax year, if
22 the taxpayer:
23 (i) timely files a Montana income tax return for the 2024 income tax year, as provided in 15-30-
24 2604; and
25 (ii) when filing the return as provided in subsection (8)(a)(i), pays to the department any balance of
26 income tax remaining unpaid.
27 (b) The waiver authority provided for under this subsection (8) terminates January 1, 2026."
