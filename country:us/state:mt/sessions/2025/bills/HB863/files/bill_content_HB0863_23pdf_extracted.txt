12 (ii) an amount equal to 100% of the individual's tax liability for the preceding tax year, if the
13 preceding tax year was a period of 12 months and if the individual filed a return for the tax year.
14 (b) Payment of estimated taxes under this section is not required if:

3 (3) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4), each installment must be 25% of the required annual
4 payment determined pursuant to subsection (1). If the taxpayer's tax situation changes, each succeeding
5 installment must be proportionally changed so that the balance of the required annual payment is paid in equal
6 installments over the remaining period of time.
7 (b) If the taxpayer's tax situation changes after the date for the first installment or any subsequent
8 installment, as specified in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), so that the taxpayer is required to pay estimated taxes,
9 the taxpayer shall pay 25% for each succeeding installment except for the first one in which a payment is
10 required. For estimated taxes required to be paid beginning with the second installment provided for in
11 subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), the taxpayer shall pay 50% for that installment and 25% for the third and fourth

17 installment.
18 (b) For any required installment, the annualized income installment is the applicable percentage
19 described in subsection (4)(c) applied to the tax computed on the basis of annualized Montana taxable income
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 863

Required Installment Applicable Percentage
First 22.5%
Second 45%
Third 67.5%
Fourth 90%
5 (d) A reduction in a required installment resulting from the application of an annualized income
6 installment must be recaptured by increasing the amount of the next required installment, determined under
7 subsection (3)(a), by the amount of the reduction. Any subsequent installment must be increased by the
8 amount of the reduction until the amount has been recaptured.
9 (5) (a) Subject to subsection (5)(e), if an estimated tax, an employer withholding tax, or a
10 combination of estimated tax and employer withholding tax is underpaid, there must be added to the amount
11 due under this chapter interest on the amount of the underpayment as provided in 15-1-216. The interest is
12 computed on the amount of the underpayment, as determined in subsection (5)(b), for the period from the time
13 the payment was due to the date payment was made or to the 15th day of the 4th month of the year following
14 the tax year in which the payment was to be made, whichever is earlier.
15 (b) For the purpose of determining the amount of interest due in subsection (5)(a), the amount of
16 the underpayment is the required installment amount less the installment amount paid, if any, on or before the
17 due date for the installment.
18 (c) For the purpose of determining the amount of interest due in subsection (5)(a), an estimated
19 payment must be credited against unpaid required installments in the order in which those installments are
20 required to be paid.
21 (d) Interest may not be charged with respect to any underpayment of the fourth installment of
22 estimated taxes if:
23 (i) the taxpayer pays in full the amount computed on the return as payable; and

2 year referred to in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b).
3 (e) Interest on the underpayment of estimated tax may not be assessed against a taxpayer if the
4 tax paid by the taxpayer from employer withholding and estimated tax payments satisfies the requirements of
5 subsection (1)(a)(i) or (1)(a)(ii) and the taxpayer has paid approximately equal quarterly installments of
6 estimated taxes.
7 (6) For the purposes of this section, "farmer or rancher" means a taxpayer who derives at least
8 66&#8201;2/3% of the taxpayer's gross income, determined for federal income tax purposes, from farming or
9 ranching operations, or both.
10 (7) The department shall promulgate rules governing reasonable extensions of time for paying the
11 estimated tax. An extension may not be for more than 6 months.
12 (8) Notwithstanding 15-1-206(2), the department may, in its discretion, waive the interest required
13 to be added under subsection (5), for underpaid estimated taxes attributable to the 2024 tax year, if the
14 taxpayer:
15
16 (i) timely files a Montana income tax return for the 2024 income tax year, as provided in 15-3024

3 (3) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4), each installment must be 25% of the required annual
4 payment determined pursuant to subsection (1). If the taxpayer's tax situation changes, each succeeding

6 installments over the remaining period of time.
7 (b) If the taxpayer's tax situation changes after the date for the first installment or any subsequent
8 installment, as specified in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), so that the taxpayer is required to pay estimated taxes,
9 the taxpayer shall pay 25% for each succeeding installment except for the first one in which a payment is
10 required. For estimated taxes required to be paid beginning with the second installment provided for in
11 subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b), the taxpayer shall pay 50% for that installment and 25% for the third and fourth

17 installment.
18 (b) For any required installment, the annualized income installment is the applicable percentage
19 described in subsection (4)(c) applied to the tax computed on the basis of annualized Montana taxable income
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 863

4 the following schedule:
Required Installment Applicable Percentage
First 22.5%
Second 45%
Third 67.5%
Fourth 90%
5 (d) A reduction in a required installment resulting from the application of an annualized income
6 installment must be recaptured by increasing the amount of the next required installment, determined under
7 subsection (3)(a), by the amount of the reduction. Any subsequent installment must be increased by the
8 amount of the reduction until the amount has been recaptured.
9 (5) (a) Subject to subsection (5)(e), if an estimated tax, an employer withholding tax, or a
10 combination of estimated tax and employer withholding tax is underpaid, there must be added to the amount
11 due under this chapter interest on the amount of the underpayment as provided in 15-1-216. The interest is
12 computed on the amount of the underpayment, as determined in subsection (5)(b), for the period from the time
13 the payment was due to the date payment was made or to the 15th day of the 4th month of the year following
14 the tax year in which the payment was to be made, whichever is earlier.
15 (b) For the purpose of determining the amount of interest due in subsection (5)(a), the amount of
16 the underpayment is the required installment amount less the installment amount paid, if any, on or before the
17 due date for the installment.
18 (c) For the purpose of determining the amount of interest due in subsection (5)(a), an estimated
19 payment must be credited against unpaid required installments in the order in which those installments are
20 required to be paid.
21 (d) Interest may not be charged with respect to any underpayment of the fourth installment of
22 estimated taxes if:
23 (i) the taxpayer pays in full the amount computed on the return as payable; and
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 863

2 year referred to in subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b).
3 (e) Interest on the underpayment of estimated tax may not be assessed against a taxpayer if the
4 tax paid by the taxpayer from employer withholding and estimated tax payments satisfies the requirements of
5 subsection (1)(a)(i) or (1)(a)(ii) and the taxpayer has paid approximately equal quarterly installments of
6 estimated taxes.
7 (6) For the purposes of this section, "farmer or rancher" means a taxpayer who derives at least
8 66&#8201;2/3% of the taxpayer's gross income, determined for federal income tax purposes, from farming or
9 ranching operations, or both.
10 (7) The department shall promulgate rules governing reasonable extensions of time for paying the
11 estimated tax. An extension may not be for more than 6 months.
12 (8) Notwithstanding 15-1-206(2), the department may, in its discretion, waive the interest required
13 to be added under subsection (5), for underpaid estimated taxes attributable to the 2024 tax year, if the
14 taxpayer:
15
16 (i) timely files a Montana income tax return for the 2024 income tax year, as provided in 15-3024
