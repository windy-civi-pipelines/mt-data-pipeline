funds. Reallocation must be based on the remaining participants' proportionate shares under the allocation

(10) An independent committee may not be construed to violate the requirement that it is not
controlled directly or indirectly by a candidate or that it may not coordinate with a candidate in connection with
the making of expenditures as provided in 13-1-101 solely because:
(a) the independent committee participates in a joint fundraising committee; and
(b) the joint fundraising committee makes a total gross contribution to a candidate that is in excess
of an individual independent committee's limits provided in 13-37-216 but that is not in excess of the remaining
combined limit, if any, of all the entities within the joint fundraising committee.
(11) The joint fundraising committee is liable for its violations of the provisions of Title 13, chapters
