Section 1:
69th Legislature 2025 SJ 26
MONTANA URGING THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT THE TRADING OF INDIVIDUAL
STOCKS BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILIES.
WHEREAS, the citizens of the United States expect that their elected representatives act in the public
interest and not for personal financial gain; and
WHEREAS, members of the United States Congress have access to sensitive, nonpublic information
and wield significant influence over legislation and regulatory actions that can directly impact the stock market
and individual companies; and
WHEREAS, public trust in government is undermined when members of Congress engage in stock
trading, creating the appearance or reality of conflicts of interest, insider trading, and self-dealing; and
WHEREAS, prohibiting members of Congress and their immediate families from trading individual
stocks would strengthen ethical standards, restore public confidence in government institutions, and affirm
Congress's commitment to serving the American people above personal financial interests; and
WHEREAS, numerous bipartisan proposals have been introduced in Congress to address this issue,
reflecting widespread agreement across the political spectrum that stronger restrictions on congressional stock
trading are necessary.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the 69th Legislature of Montana urges the United States Congress to pass a law prohibiting the
trading of individual stocks by members of Congress and their immediate families to restore the American
people's confidence in government institutions.
