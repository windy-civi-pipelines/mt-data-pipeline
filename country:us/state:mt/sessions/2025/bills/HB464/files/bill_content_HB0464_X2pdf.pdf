name of the person insured is specified in a policy insuring property, the insurance can be applied only to the
person's own proper interest.

insurance of property, and the insurance passes to the person taking the insured's interest in the thing insured.
A change of interest in real property by a transfer on death deed on the death of the insured does not avoid an
insurance of real property, and the real property insurance coverage continues beyond the death of the named
insured in accordance with 72-6-412(5) and policy coverage, including all applicable terms and conditions.
(3) A transfer of interest by one of several partners, joint owners, or owners in common, who are
jointly insured, to the others does not avoid an insurance of property even though it has been agreed that the
insurance must cease upon an alienation of the thing insured."

"72-6-412. Effect of transfer on death deed at transferor's death. (1) Except as otherwise provided
