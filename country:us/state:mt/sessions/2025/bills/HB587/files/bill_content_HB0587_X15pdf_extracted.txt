BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:

Section 2:
Section 1. Section 82-4-203, MCA, is amended to read:
"82-4-203. Definitions. Unless the context requires otherwise, in this part the following definitions
apply:
(1) "Abandoned" means an operation in which a mineral is not being produced and that the
department determines will not continue or resume operation.
(2) "Adjacent area" means the area outside the permit area where a resource or resources,
determined in the context in which the term is used, are or could reasonably be expected to be adversely
affected by proposed mining operations, including probable impacts from underground workings.
(3) "Affected drainage basin" means an area of land where surface water and ground water quality
and quantity are affected by mining activities and where they drain to a common point.
(4) (a) "Alluvial valley floor" means the unconsolidated stream-laid deposits holding streams where
water availability is sufficient for subirrigation or flood irrigation agricultural activities.
(b) The term does not include upland areas that are generally overlain by a thin veneer of colluvial
deposits composed chiefly of debris from sheet erosion and deposits by unconcentrated runoff or slope wash,
together with talus, other mass movement accumulation, and windblown deposits.
(5) "Amendment" means a change in the mine or reclamation plan that increases the operation's

permitted boundaries. The term includes major revisions but does not include incidental boundary revisions or
minor revisions.
(6) "Approximate original contour" means that surface configuration achieved by backfilling and
grading of the mined area so that the reclaimed area, including any terracing or access roads, closely
resembles the general surface configuration of the land prior to mining and blends into and complements the
drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain, with all highwalls, spoil piles, and coal refuse piles eliminated, so
that:
(a) the reclaimed terrain closely resembles the general surface configuration if it is comparable to
the premine terrain. For example, if the area was basically level or gently rolling before mining, it should retain
these features after mining, recognizing that rolls and dips need not be restored to their original locations and
that level areas may be increased.
(b) the reclaimed area blends with and complements the drainage pattern of the surrounding area
so that water intercepted within or from the surrounding terrain flows through and from the reclaimed area in an
unobstructed and controlled manner;
(c) postmining drainage basins may differ in size, location, configuration, orientation, and density
of ephemeral drainageways compared to the premining topography if they are hydrologically stable, soil erosion
is controlled to the extent appropriate for the postmining land use, and the hydrologic balance is protected; and
(d) the reclaimed surface configuration is appropriate for the postmining land use.
(7) "Aquifer" means any geologic formation or natural zone beneath the earth's surface that
contains or stores water and transmits it from one point to another in quantities that permit or have the potential
to permit economic development as a water source.
(8) (a) "Area of land affected" means the area of land from which overburden is to be or has been
removed and upon which the overburden is to be or has been deposited.
(b) The term includes:
(i) all land overlying any tunnels, shafts, or other excavations used to extract the mineral;
(ii) lands affected by the construction of new railroad loops and roads or the improvement or use
of existing railroad loops and roads to gain access and to haul the mineral;

(27) "Imminent danger to the health and safety of the public" means the existence of any condition
or practice or any violation of a permit or other requirement of this part in a strip- or underground-coal-mining
and reclamation operation that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial physical harm to persons
outside the permit area before the condition, practice, or violation can be abated. A reasonable expectation of
death or serious injury before abatement exists if a rational person, subjected to the same conditions or
practices giving rise to the peril, would not willingly be exposed to the danger during the time necessary for
abatement.

AN ACT REVISING MINE RECLAMATION LAWS; REVISING THE DEFINITION OF MATERIAL DAMAGE;
CLARIFYING HYDROLOGIC AND GEOLOGIC INFORMATION FOR A PERMIT; PROVIDING RULEMAKING
AUTHORITY; AMENDING SECTIONS 82-4-203 AND 82-4-222, MCA; PROVIDING FOR CONTINGENT
VOIDNESS; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE AND A RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY
DATE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
Section 1. Section 82-4-203, MCA, is amended to read:
"82-4-203. Definitions. Unless the context requires otherwise, in this part the following definitions
apply:
(1) "Abandoned" means an operation in which a mineral is not being produced and that the
department determines will not continue or resume operation.
(2) "Adjacent area" means the area outside the permit area where a resource or resources,
determined in the context in which the term is used, are or could reasonably be expected to be adversely
affected by proposed mining operations, including probable impacts from underground workings.
(3) "Affected drainage basin" means an area of land where surface water and ground water quality
and quantity are affected by mining activities and where they drain to a common point.
(4) (a) "Alluvial valley floor" means the unconsolidated stream-laid deposits holding streams where
water availability is sufficient for subirrigation or flood irrigation agricultural activities.
(b) The term does not include upland areas that are generally overlain by a thin veneer of colluvial
deposits composed chiefly of debris from sheet erosion and deposits by unconcentrated runoff or slope wash,
together with talus, other mass movement accumulation, and windblown deposits.
(5) "Amendment" means a change in the mine or reclamation plan that increases the operation's

69th Legislature 2025 HB 587
permitted boundaries. The term includes major revisions but does not include incidental boundary revisions or
minor revisions.
(6) "Approximate original contour" means that surface configuration achieved by backfilling and
grading of the mined area so that the reclaimed area, including any terracing or access roads, closely
resembles the general surface configuration of the land prior to mining and blends into and complements the
drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain, with all highwalls, spoil piles, and coal refuse piles eliminated, so
that:
(a) the reclaimed terrain closely resembles the general surface configuration if it is comparable to
the premine terrain. For example, if the area was basically level or gently rolling before mining, it should retain
these features after mining, recognizing that rolls and dips need not be restored to their original locations and
that level areas may be increased.
(b) the reclaimed area blends with and complements the drainage pattern of the surrounding area
so that water intercepted within or from the surrounding terrain flows through and from the reclaimed area in an
unobstructed and controlled manner;
(c) postmining drainage basins may differ in size, location, configuration, orientation, and density
of ephemeral drainageways compared to the premining topography if they are hydrologically stable, soil erosion
is controlled to the extent appropriate for the postmining land use, and the hydrologic balance is protected; and
(d) the reclaimed surface configuration is appropriate for the postmining land use.
(7) "Aquifer" means any geologic formation or natural zone beneath the earth's surface that
contains or stores water and transmits it from one point to another in quantities that permit or have the potential
to permit economic development as a water source.
(8) (a) "Area of land affected" means the area of land from which overburden is to be or has been
removed and upon which the overburden is to be or has been deposited.
(b) The term includes:
(i) all land overlying any tunnels, shafts, or other excavations used to extract the mineral;
(ii) lands affected by the construction of new railroad loops and roads or the improvement or use
of existing railroad loops and roads to gain access and to haul the mineral;
(iii) processing facilities at or near the mine site or other mine-associated facilities, waste

mining operation and includes plans for the removal and use of minable and marketable coal located within the
area planned to be mined.
(12) (a) "Coal preparation" means the chemical or physical processing of coal and its cleaning,
concentrating, or other processing or preparation.
(b) The term does not mean the conversion of coal to another energy form or to a gaseous or
liquid hydrocarbon, except for incidental amounts that do not leave the plant, nor does the term mean
processing for other than commercial purposes.
(13) "Coal preparation plant" means a commercial facility where coal is subject to coal preparation.
The term includes commercial facilities associated with coal preparation activities but is not limited to loading
buildings, water treatment facilities, water storage facilities, settling basins and impoundments, and coal
processing and other waste disposal areas.
(14) "Contour strip mining" means that strip-mining method commonly carried out in areas of rough
and hilly topography in which the coal or mineral seam outcrops along the side of the slope and entrance are
made to the seam by excavating a bench or table cut at and along the site of the seam outcropping, with the
excavated overburden commonly being cast down the slope below the mineral seam and the operating bench.
(15) "Cropland" means land used for the production of adapted crops for harvest, alone or in
rotation with grasses and legumes, that include row crops, small grain crops, hay crops, nursery crops, orchard
crops, and other similar crops.
(16) "Degree" means a measurement from the horizontal. In each case, the measurement is subject
to a tolerance of 5% error.
(17) "Department" means the department of environmental quality provided for in 2-15-3501.

an operation. However, the nonremoval or nonuse of minable and marketable coal that occurs because of
compliance with reclamation standards established by the department is not considered failure to conserve
coal.
(21) "Fill bench" means that portion of a bench or table that is formed by depositing overburden
beyond or downslope from the cut section as formed in the contour method of strip mining.
(22) "Fish and wildlife habitat" means land dedicated wholly or partially to the production, protection,

vegetation is actively managed for livestock grazing or browsing or occasional hay production.
(25) "Higher or better uses" means postmining land uses that have a higher economic value or
noneconomic benefit to the landowner or the community than the premining land uses.
(26) "Hydrologic balance" means the relationship between the quality and quantity of water inflow
to, water outflow from, and water storage in a hydrologic unit, such as a drainage basin, aquifer, soil zone, lake,
or reservoir, and encompasses the dynamic relationships among precipitation, runoff, evaporation, and
changes in ground water and surface water storage.
(27) "Imminent danger to the health and safety of the public" means the existence of any condition
or practice or any violation of a permit or other requirement of this part in a strip- or underground-coal-mining
and reclamation operation that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial physical harm to persons
outside the permit area before the condition, practice, or violation can be abated. A reasonable expectation of
death or serious injury before abatement exists if a rational person, subjected to the same conditions or
practices giving rise to the peril, would not willingly be exposed to the danger during the time necessary for
abatement.

least some part of the year and that obtains its flow from both ground water discharge and surface runoff.
(32) "Land use" means specific uses or management-related activities, rather than the vegetative
cover of the land. Land uses may be identified in combination when joint or seasonal uses occur and may
include land used for support facilities that are an integral part of the land use. Land use categories include
cropland, developed water resources, fish and wildlife habitat, forestry, grazing land, industrial or commercial,
pastureland, land occasionally cut for hay, recreation, or residential.
(33) "Major revision" means a change in the mining or reclamation plan that:
(a) significantly changes the postmining drainage plan, the overall postmining land use, or the
bonding level of the permitted area; or
(b) adversely affects the reclaimability of the area or the hydrologic balance on or off the permitted
area.

conducted on the land to be affected, including the nature and the depth of the various strata or overburden and
topsoil, the quantities and location of subsurface water and its quality, the thickness of any mineral seam, an
analysis of the chemical properties of the minerals, including the acidity, sulfur content, and trace mineral
elements of any coal seam, as well as the British thermal unit (Btu) content of the seam, and an analysis of the
overburden, including topsoil. If test borings or core samplings are submitted, each permit application must
contain two sets of geologic cross sections accurately depicting the known geologic makeup beneath the
surface of the affected land. Each set must depict subsurface conditions at intervals the department requires
across the surface and must run at a 90-degree angle to the other set. The department may not require
intervals of less than 500 feet. Each cross section must depict the thickness and geologic character of all
known strata, beginning with the topsoil. In addition, each application for an underground-mining permit must be
accompanied by cross sections and maps showing the proposed underground locations of all shafts, entries,
and haulageways or other excavations to be excavated during the permit period. These cross sections must
also include all existing shafts, entries, and haulageways.
(l) the name of a newspaper of general circulation in the locality of the proposed activity in which
the applicant will prominently publish at least once a week for 4 successive weeks after submission of the
application an announcement of the applicant's application for a strip-mining or underground-mining permit and
a detailed description of the area of land to be affected if a permit is granted. If that newspaper is not published
in Montana, the applicant shall also provide the name of a newspaper of general circulation in the county in
which the proposed operation is located that is published in Montana in which the applicant will publish an
announcement and description in accordance with this subsection.
(m) a determination of the probable hydrologic consequences of coal mining and reclamation
operations, both on and off the mine site, with respect to the hydrologic regime and quantity and quality of water
in surface water and ground water systems, including the dissolved and suspended solids under seasonal flow
conditions and the collection of sufficient data for the mine site and surrounding areas, so that cumulative
impacts of all anticipated mining in the area upon the hydrology of the area and particularly upon water
availability can be made. However, this determination is not required until hydrologic information on the general
area prior to mining is made available from an appropriate federal or state agency if the information is available.
If the information is not available, the department shall make a determination using hydrologic and geologic

information collected by the applicant for the purposes of completing the permit application. The permit may not
be approved until the information is available and is incorporated into the application. The determination of
probable hydrologic consequences must include findings on:
(i) whether adverse impacts may occur to the hydrologic balance;
(ii) whether acid-forming or toxic-forming materials are present that could result in the
contamination of ground water or surface water supplies;
(iii) whether the proposed operation may proximately result in contamination, diminution, or
interruption of an underground or surface source of water within the proposed permit or adjacent areas that is
used for domestic, agricultural, industrial, or other beneficial use; and
(iv) what impact the operation will have on:
(A) sediment yields from the disturbed area;
(B) acidity, total suspended and dissolved solids, and other important water quality parameters of
local impact;
(C) flooding or streamflow alteration;
(D) ground water and surface water availability; and
(E) other characteristics required by the department that potentially affect beneficial uses of water
in and adjacent to the permit area.
(n) a plan for monitoring ground water and surface water, based upon the determination of
probable hydrologic consequences required under subsection (1)(m). The plan must provide for the monitoring
of parameters that relate to the availability and suitability of ground water and surface water for current and
approved postmining land uses and the objectives for protection of the hydrologic balance.
(o) a map depicting the projected postmining topography, using cross sections, range diagrams, or
other methods approved by the department, showing the manner of spoil placement, showing removal of coal
volume and overburden swell, and including:
(i) locations and elevations of tie-in points with adjacent unmined drainageways;
(ii) approximate locations of primary or highest order drainageways and associated drainage
divides in the reclaimed topography; and
(iii) projected elevations of primary drainageways and associated drainage divides and generalized

slopes with the level of detail appropriate to project the approximate original contour;
(p) the condition of the land to be covered by the permit prior to any mining, including:
(i) the land uses existing at the time of the application and, if the land has a history of previous
mining, the uses that preceded any mining;
(ii) the capability of the land prior to any mining to support a variety of uses, giving consideration to
soil characteristics, topography, and vegetative cover; and
(iii) the productivity of the land prior to mining, including appropriate classification as prime farm
land, as well as the average yield of food, fiber, forage, or wood products from land under high levels of
management;
(q) a coal conservation plan;
(r) other or further information as the department may require.
(2) The application for a permit must be accompanied by maps meeting the requirements of
subsections (2)(a) through (2)(n). The maps must:
(a) identify the area to correspond with the application;
(b) show any adjacent deep mining or surface mining, the boundaries of surface properties, and
names of owners of record of the affected area and within 1,000 feet of any part of the affected area;
(c) show the names and locations of all streams, creeks, or other bodies of water, roads, buildings,
cemeteries, oil and gas wells, and utility lines on the area of land affected and within 1,000 feet of the area;
(d) show by appropriate markings the boundaries of the area of land affected, any cropline of the
seam or deposit of mineral to be mined, and the total number of acres involved in the area of land affected;
(e) show the date on which the map was prepared and the north point;
(f) show the final surface and underground water drainage plan on and away from the area of land
affected. This plan must indicate the directional and volume flow of water, constructed drainways, natural
