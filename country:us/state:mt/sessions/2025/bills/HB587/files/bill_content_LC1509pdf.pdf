11
12 Section 1. Section 82-4-203, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "82-4-203. Definitions. Unless the context requires otherwise, in this part the following definitions
14 apply:
15 (1) "Abandoned" means an operation in which a mineral is not being produced and that the
16 department determines will not continue or resume operation.
17 (2) "Adjacent area" means the area outside the permit area where a resource or resources,
18 determined in the context in which the term is used, are or could reasonably be expected to be adversely
19 affected by proposed mining operations, including probable impacts from underground workings.
20 (3) "Affected drainage basin" means an area of land where surface water and ground water quality
21 and quantity are affected by mining activities and where they drain to a common point.
22 (4) (a) "Alluvial valley floor" means the unconsolidated stream-laid deposits holding streams where
23 water availability is sufficient for subirrigation or flood irrigation agricultural activities.
24 (b) The term does not include upland areas that are generally overlain by a thin veneer of colluvial
25 deposits composed chiefly of debris from sheet erosion and deposits by unconcentrated runoff or slope wash,
26 together with talus, other mass movement accumulation, and windblown deposits.
27 (5) "Amendment" means a change in the mine or reclamation plan that increases the operation's
28 permitted boundaries. The term includes major revisions but does not include incidental boundary revisions or

69th Legislature 2025 LC 1509
1 minor revisions.
2 (6) "Approximate original contour" means that surface configuration achieved by backfilling and
3 grading of the mined area so that the reclaimed area, including any terracing or access roads, closely
4 resembles the general surface configuration of the land prior to mining and blends into and complements the
5 drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain, with all highwalls, spoil piles, and coal refuse piles eliminated, so
6 that:
7 (a) the reclaimed terrain closely resembles the general surface configuration if it is comparable to
8 the premine terrain. For example, if the area was basically level or gently rolling before mining, it should retain
9 these features after mining, recognizing that rolls and dips need not be restored to their original locations and
10 that level areas may be increased.
11 (b) the reclaimed area blends with and complements the drainage pattern of the surrounding area
12 so that water intercepted within or from the surrounding terrain flows through and from the reclaimed area in an
13 unobstructed and controlled manner;
14 (c) postmining drainage basins may differ in size, location, configuration, orientation, and density
15 of ephemeral drainageways compared to the premining topography if they are hydrologically stable, soil erosion
16 is controlled to the extent appropriate for the postmining land use, and the hydrologic balance is protected; and
17 (d) the reclaimed surface configuration is appropriate for the postmining land use.
18 (7) "Aquifer" means any geologic formation or natural zone beneath the earth's surface that
19 contains or stores water and transmits it from one point to another in quantities that permit or have the potential
20 to permit economic development as a water source.
21 (8) (a) "Area of land affected" means the area of land from which overburden is to be or has been
22 removed and upon which the overburden is to be or has been deposited.
23 (b) The term includes:
24 (i) all land overlying any tunnels, shafts, or other excavations used to extract the mineral;
25 (ii) lands affected by the construction of new railroad loops and roads or the improvement or use
26 of existing railroad loops and roads to gain access and to haul the mineral;
27 (iii) processing facilities at or near the mine site or other mine-associated facilities, waste
28 deposition areas, treatment ponds, and any other surface or subsurface disturbance associated with strip

11 liquid hydrocarbon, except for incidental amounts that do not leave the plant, nor does the term mean
12 processing for other than commercial purposes.
13 (13) "Coal preparation plant" means a commercial facility where coal is subject to coal preparation.
14 The term includes commercial facilities associated with coal preparation activities but is not limited to loading

16 processing and other waste disposal areas.
17 (14) "Contour strip mining" means that strip-mining method commonly carried out in areas of rough
18 and hilly topography in which the coal or mineral seam outcrops along the side of the slope and entrance are
19 made to the seam by excavating a bench or table cut at and along the site of the seam outcropping, with the
20 excavated overburden commonly being cast down the slope below the mineral seam and the operating bench.
21 (15) "Cropland" means land used for the production of adapted crops for harvest, alone or in
22 rotation with grasses and legumes, that include row crops, small grain crops, hay crops, nursery crops, orchard
23 crops, and other similar crops.

5 soil characteristics, topography, and vegetative cover; and
6 (iii) the productivity of the land prior to mining, including appropriate classification as prime farm

19 seam or deposit of mineral to be mined, and the total number of acres involved in the area of land affected;
20 (e) show the date on which the map was prepared and the north point;
21 (f) show the final surface and underground water drainage plan on and away from the area of land
22 affected. This plan must indicate the directional and volume flow of water, constructed drainways, natural
23 waterways used for drainage, and the streams or tributaries receiving the discharge.
24 (g) show the proposed location of waste or refuse area;

1 (l) show a listing of plant species encountered in the area to be affected and their relative
2 dominance in the area, together with an enumeration of tree species and the approximate number of each
3 species occurring per acre on the area to be affected, and the locations generally of the various species of

6 Title 37, chapter 67; and
7 (n) contain other or further information as the department may require.
8 (3) If the department finds that the probable total annual production at all locations of any strip-
9 mining or underground-coal-mining operation applied for will not exceed 100,000 tons, any determination of
10 probable hydrologic consequences that the department requires and the statement of result of test borings or
11 core samplings must, upon written request of the operator, be performed by a qualified public or private
12 laboratory designated by the department. The department shall assume the cost of the determination and
13 statement to the extent that it has received funds for this purpose.
14 (4) In addition to the information and maps required by this section, each application for a permit
15 must be accompanied by detailed plans or proposals showing the method of operation, the manner, time or
16 distance, and estimated cost for backfilling, subsidence stabilization, water control, grading work, highwall
17 reduction, topsoiling, planting, and revegetating, and a reclamation plan for the area affected by the operation,
18 which proposals must meet the requirements of this part and rules adopted under this part. The reclamation
19 plan must address the life of the operation and indicate the size, sequence, and the timing of the subareas for
20 which it is anticipated that individual permits will be sought.
21 (5) Each applicant for a coal mining permit shall submit as part of the application a certificate
22 issued by an insurance company authorized to do business in the state, certifying that the applicant has in force
