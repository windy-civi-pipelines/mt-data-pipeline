11 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
12
13 Section 1. Section 82-4-203, MCA, is amended to read:
14 "82-4-203. Definitions. Unless the context requires otherwise, in this part the following definitions
15 apply:
16 (1) "Abandoned" means an operation in which a mineral is not being produced and that the
17 department determines will not continue or resume operation.
18 (2) "Adjacent area" means the area outside the permit area where a resource or resources,
19 determined in the context in which the term is used, are or could reasonably be expected to be adversely
20 affected by proposed mining operations, including probable impacts from underground workings.
21 (3) "Affected drainage basin" means an area of land where surface water and ground water quality
22 and quantity are affected by mining activities and where they drain to a common point.
23 (4) (a) "Alluvial valley floor" means the unconsolidated stream-laid deposits holding streams where
24 water availability is sufficient for subirrigation or flood irrigation agricultural activities.
25 (b) The term does not include upland areas that are generally overlain by a thin veneer of colluvial
26 deposits composed chiefly of debris from sheet erosion and deposits by unconcentrated runoff or slope wash,
27 together with talus, other mass movement accumulation, and windblown deposits.
28 (5) "Amendment" means a change in the mine or reclamation plan that increases the operation's

1 permitted boundaries. The term includes major revisions but does not include incidental boundary revisions or
2 minor revisions.
3 (6) "Approximate original contour" means that surface configuration achieved by backfilling and
4 grading of the mined area so that the reclaimed area, including any terracing or access roads, closely
5 resembles the general surface configuration of the land prior to mining and blends into and complements the
6 drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain, with all highwalls, spoil piles, and coal refuse piles eliminated, so
7 that:
8 (a) the reclaimed terrain closely resembles the general surface configuration if it is comparable to
9 the premine terrain. For example, if the area was basically level or gently rolling before mining, it should retain
10 these features after mining, recognizing that rolls and dips need not be restored to their original locations and
11 that level areas may be increased.
12 (b) the reclaimed area blends with and complements the drainage pattern of the surrounding area
13 so that water intercepted within or from the surrounding terrain flows through and from the reclaimed area in an
14 unobstructed and controlled manner;
15 (c) postmining drainage basins may differ in size, location, configuration, orientation, and density
16 of ephemeral drainageways compared to the premining topography if they are hydrologically stable, soil erosion
17 is controlled to the extent appropriate for the postmining land use, and the hydrologic balance is protected; and
18 (d) the reclaimed surface configuration is appropriate for the postmining land use.
19 (7) "Aquifer" means any geologic formation or natural zone beneath the earth's surface that
20 contains or stores water and transmits it from one point to another in quantities that permit or have the potential
21 to permit economic development as a water source.
22 (8) (a) "Area of land affected" means the area of land from which overburden is to be or has been
23 removed and upon which the overburden is to be or has been deposited.
24 (b) The term includes:
25 (i) all land overlying any tunnels, shafts, or other excavations used to extract the mineral;
26 (ii) lands affected by the construction of new railroad loops and roads or the improvement or use
27 of existing railroad loops and roads to gain access and to haul the mineral;

17 processing and other waste disposal areas.
18 (14) "Contour strip mining" means that strip-mining method commonly carried out in areas of rough
19 and hilly topography in which the coal or mineral seam outcrops along the side of the slope and entrance are
20 made to the seam by excavating a bench or table cut at and along the site of the seam outcropping, with the
21 excavated overburden commonly being cast down the slope below the mineral seam and the operating bench.
22 (15) "Cropland" means land used for the production of adapted crops for harvest, alone or in
23 rotation with grasses and legumes, that include row crops, small grain crops, hay crops, nursery crops, orchard

26 death or serious injury before abatement exists if a rational person, subjected to the same conditions or
27 practices giving rise to the peril, would not willingly be exposed to the danger during the time necessary for
28 abatement.

6 DEFINITION OF "MATERIAL DAMAGE"; CLARIFYING HYDROLOGIC AND GEOLOGIC INFORMATION FOR
7 A PERMIT; PROVIDING RULEMAKING AUTHORITY; AMENDING SECTIONS 82-4-203 AND 82-4-222, MCA;
8 PROVIDING FOR CONTINGENT VOIDNESS; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE AND A
9 RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY DATE.”
10
11 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
12
13 Section 1. Section 82-4-203, MCA, is amended to read:
14 "82-4-203. Definitions. Unless the context requires otherwise, in this part the following definitions
15 apply:
16 (1) "Abandoned" means an operation in which a mineral is not being produced and that the
17 department determines will not continue or resume operation.
18 (2) "Adjacent area" means the area outside the permit area where a resource or resources,
19 determined in the context in which the term is used, are or could reasonably be expected to be adversely
20 affected by proposed mining operations, including probable impacts from underground workings.
21 (3) "Affected drainage basin" means an area of land where surface water and ground water quality
22 and quantity are affected by mining activities and where they drain to a common point.
23 (4) (a) "Alluvial valley floor" means the unconsolidated stream-laid deposits holding streams where
24 water availability is sufficient for subirrigation or flood irrigation agricultural activities.
25 (b) The term does not include upland areas that are generally overlain by a thin veneer of colluvial
26 deposits composed chiefly of debris from sheet erosion and deposits by unconcentrated runoff or slope wash,
27 together with talus, other mass movement accumulation, and windblown deposits.
28 (5) "Amendment" means a change in the mine or reclamation plan that increases the operation's

69th Legislature 2025 HB 587.1
1 permitted boundaries. The term includes major revisions but does not include incidental boundary revisions or
2 minor revisions.
3 (6) "Approximate original contour" means that surface configuration achieved by backfilling and
4 grading of the mined area so that the reclaimed area, including any terracing or access roads, closely
5 resembles the general surface configuration of the land prior to mining and blends into and complements the
6 drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain, with all highwalls, spoil piles, and coal refuse piles eliminated, so
7 that:
8 (a) the reclaimed terrain closely resembles the general surface configuration if it is comparable to
9 the premine terrain. For example, if the area was basically level or gently rolling before mining, it should retain
10 these features after mining, recognizing that rolls and dips need not be restored to their original locations and
11 that level areas may be increased.
12 (b) the reclaimed area blends with and complements the drainage pattern of the surrounding area
13 so that water intercepted within or from the surrounding terrain flows through and from the reclaimed area in an
14 unobstructed and controlled manner;
15 (c) postmining drainage basins may differ in size, location, configuration, orientation, and density
16 of ephemeral drainageways compared to the premining topography if they are hydrologically stable, soil erosion
17 is controlled to the extent appropriate for the postmining land use, and the hydrologic balance is protected; and
18 (d) the reclaimed surface configuration is appropriate for the postmining land use.
19 (7) "Aquifer" means any geologic formation or natural zone beneath the earth's surface that
20 contains or stores water and transmits it from one point to another in quantities that permit or have the potential
21 to permit economic development as a water source.
22 (8) (a) "Area of land affected" means the area of land from which overburden is to be or has been
23 removed and upon which the overburden is to be or has been deposited.
24 (b) The term includes:
25 (i) all land overlying any tunnels, shafts, or other excavations used to extract the mineral;
26 (ii) lands affected by the construction of new railroad loops and roads or the improvement or use
27 of existing railroad loops and roads to gain access and to haul the mineral;
28 (iii) processing facilities at or near the mine site or other mine-associated facilities, waste

10 concentrating, or other processing or preparation.
11 (b) The term does not mean the conversion of coal to another energy form or to a gaseous or
12 liquid hydrocarbon, except for incidental amounts that do not leave the plant, nor does the term mean
13 processing for other than commercial purposes.
14 (13) "Coal preparation plant" means a commercial facility where coal is subject to coal preparation.
15 The term includes commercial facilities associated with coal preparation activities but is not limited to loading
16 buildings, water treatment facilities, water storage facilities, settling basins and impoundments, and coal
17 processing and other waste disposal areas.
18 (14) "Contour strip mining" means that strip-mining method commonly carried out in areas of rough
19 and hilly topography in which the coal or mineral seam outcrops along the side of the slope and entrance are
20 made to the seam by excavating a bench or table cut at and along the site of the seam outcropping, with the
21 excavated overburden commonly being cast down the slope below the mineral seam and the operating bench.
22 (15) "Cropland" means land used for the production of adapted crops for harvest, alone or in
23 rotation with grasses and legumes, that include row crops, small grain crops, hay crops, nursery crops, orchard
24 crops, and other similar crops.
25 (16) "Degree" means a measurement from the horizontal. In each case, the measurement is subject
26 to a tolerance of 5% error.

3 the immediate watershed or in response to the melting of snow or ice and is always above the local water table.
4 (20) "Failure to conserve coal" means the nonremoval or nonuse of minable and marketable coal by
5 an operation. However, the nonremoval or nonuse of minable and marketable coal that occurs because of
6 compliance with reclamation standards established by the department is not considered failure to conserve
7 coal.
8 (21) "Fill bench" means that portion of a bench or table that is formed by depositing overburden
9 beyond or downslope from the cut section as formed in the contour method of strip mining.
10 (22) "Fish and wildlife habitat" means land dedicated wholly or partially to the production, protection,
11 or management of species of fish or wildlife.

13 wood-derived products.
14 (24) "Grazing land" means land used for grasslands and forest lands where the indigenous
15 vegetation is actively managed for livestock grazing or browsing or occasional hay production.
16 (25) "Higher or better uses" means postmining land uses that have a higher economic value or
17 noneconomic benefit to the landowner or the community than the premining land uses.
18 (26) "Hydrologic balance" means the relationship between the quality and quantity of water inflow
19 to, water outflow from, and water storage in a hydrologic unit, such as a drainage basin, aquifer, soil zone, lake,
20 or reservoir, and encompasses the dynamic relationships among precipitation, runoff, evaporation, and
21 changes in ground water and surface water storage.
22 (27) "Imminent danger to the health and safety of the public" means the existence of any condition
23 or practice or any violation of a permit or other requirement of this part in a strip- or underground-coal-mining
24 and reclamation operation that could reasonably be expected to cause substantial physical harm to persons
25 outside the permit area before the condition, practice, or violation can be abated. A reasonable expectation of
26 death or serious injury before abatement exists if a rational person, subjected to the same conditions or
27 practices giving rise to the peril, would not willingly be exposed to the danger during the time necessary for
28 abatement.
