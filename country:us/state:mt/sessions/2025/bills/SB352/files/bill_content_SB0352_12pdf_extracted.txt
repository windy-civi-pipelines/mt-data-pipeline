69th Legislature 2025 SB 352.1
2 INTRODUCED BY M. REGIER
3
4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT EXTENDING LEGISLATIVE IMMUNITY TO LEGISLATIVE STAFF
5 FOR INFORMATION THAT IS CONSIDERED PRIVILEGED WHEN HELD BY A LEGISLATOR; AMENDING
6 SECTIONS 2-9-101 AND 2-9-901, MCA; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE.”
7
8 WHEREAS, Article V, section 8, of the Montana Constitution contains a speech and debate clause
9 virtually identical to Article I, section 6, of the Constitution of the United States, the federal speech and debate
10 clause; and
11 WHEREAS, in the case of United States v. Johnson, 383 U.S. 169, 178 (1966), the United States
12 Supreme Court determined that the federal speech and debate clause had origins going back to the English Bill
13 of Rights of 1689, which reasoned that "the Freedom of Speech, and Debates or Proceedings in Parliament,
14 ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parliament"; and
15 WHEREAS, in the case of Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606 (1972), the United States Supreme
16 Court held that the speech and debate clause in the Constitution of the United States makes the
17 communications between members of Congress and their staff privileged and confidential; and
18 WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court explained its reasoning in the Gravel case as follows:
19 "The day-to-day work of [legislative] aides is so critical to the Members' performance that they must be treated
20 as the latter's alter ego; and that if they are not so recognized, the central role of the Speech and Debate
21 Clause--to prevent intimidation of legislators by the Executive and accountability before a possibly hostile
22 judiciary--will inevitably be diminished and frustrated"; and
23 WHEREAS, the Legislature intends by this act to apply the longstanding holding of the Gravel case to
24 the Montana Legislature.
