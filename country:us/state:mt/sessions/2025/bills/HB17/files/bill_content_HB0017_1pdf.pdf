6 LANDS TAXATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE; AMENDING SECTION 15-44-103, MCA; AND PROVIDING AN
7 IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE.”

9 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
10
11 Section 1. Section 15-44-103, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "15-44-103. Legislative intent -- value of forest lands -- valuation zones. (1) In order to encourage
13 landowners of private forest lands to retain and improve their holdings of forest lands, to promote better forest
14 practices, and to encourage the investment of capital in reforestation, forest lands must be classified and
15 assessed under the provisions of this section.
16 (2) The forest productivity value of forest land must be determined by:
17 (a) capitalizing the value of the mean annual net wood production at the culmination of mean
18 annual increment plus other agriculture-related income, if any; less
19 (b) annualized expenses, including but not limited to the establishment, protection, maintenance,
20 improvement, and management of the crop over the rotation period.
21 (3) To determine the forest productivity value of forest lands, the department shall:
22 (a) divide the state into appropriate forest valuation zones, with each zone designated so as to
23 recognize the uniqueness of marketing areas, timber types, growth rates, access, operability, and other
24 pertinent factors of that zone; and
25 (b) establish a uniform system of forest land classification that takes into consideration the
26 productive capacity of the site to grow forest products and furnish other associated agricultural uses.
27 (4) In computing the forest land productivity valuation for each forest valuation zone, the
28 department shall determine the productive capacity value of all forest lands in each forest valuation zone using

69th Legislature 2025 HB 17.1
1 the formula V = I/R, where:
2 (a) V is the per-acre forest productivity value of the forest land;
3 (b) I is the per-acre net income of forest lands in each valuation zone and is determined by the
4 department using the formula I = (M x SV) + AI - C, where:
5 (i) I is the per-acre net income;
6 (ii) M is the mean annual net wood production;
7 (iii) SV is the stumpage value;
8 (iv) AI is the per-acre agriculture-related income; and
9 (v) C is the per-unit cost of the forest product and agricultural product produced, if any; and
10 (c) R is the capitalization rate determined by the department as provided in subsection (6).
11 (5) Net income must:
12 (a) be calculated for each year of a base period, which is the most recent 10-year period for which
13 data is available prior to the date the revaluation cycle ends. Data referred to in subsection (4)(b) must be
14 averaged.
15 (b) be based on the average stumpage value of timber harvested within the forest valuation zone,
16 excluding the lowest and highest annual stumpage value in the period, and on the associated production cost
17 data for the base period from sources considered appropriate by the department; and
18 (c) include agriculture-related net income for the same time period as the period used to determine
19 average stumpage values.
20 (6) The capitalization rate must be calculated for each year of the base period and is the average
21 capitalization rate determined by the department after consultation with the forest lands taxation advisory
22 committee, plus the effective tax rate. The capitalization rate must be adopted by rule. However, the
23 capitalization rate for each year of the base period may not be less than 8%.
24 (7) The effective tax rate must be calculated for each year of the base period by dividing the total
25 estimated tax due on forest lands subject to the provisions of this section by the total forest value of those
26 lands.
27 (8) For the purposes of this section, if forest service sales are used in the determination of
28 stumpage values, the department shall take into account purchaser road credits.
