16 funds. Reallocation must be based on the remaining participants' proportionate shares under the allocation
17 formula. If reallocation results in a violation of a contributor's limit under 13-37-216, the joint fundraising
18 committee shall return the amount of the contribution that exceeds the limit to the contributor. However,
19 contributions that have been designated by a contributor may not be reallocated by the joint fundraising
