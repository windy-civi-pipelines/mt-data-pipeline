WHEREAS, the Montana Constitution has enshrined access to public information in the Right to Know
in Article II, section 9, which states that "No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to
observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in
cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure"; and
WHEREAS, the Right of Participation in Article II, section 8, of the Montana Constitution also ensures
that the public must be given a reasonable opportunity to participate in the operation of governmental agencies
prior to the final decision as may be provided by law; and
WHEREAS, these fundamental rights are the foundation on which every Montanan is able to exercise
the power to hold elected officials accountable for their actions and decisions; and
WHEREAS, the Montana Supreme Court recently issued a decision in O'Neill v. Gianforte, 2025 MT 2,
holding that the Governor enjoys a common law-based executive privilege, which protects certain
communications and information from public disclosure; and
WHEREAS, the Legislature holds the power to change the common law through the proper and valid
enactment of legislation; and
WHEREAS, the process outlined by the majority in O'Neill is unwieldy and cumbersome, requiring an in
camera review by a court of all documents for which an executive privilege is asserted, causing substantial
costs to Montanans seeking records and to the state, adding to the workload of an already burdened judicial
system, and stalling the ability of a Montana citizen to receive the public information about the workings of

government to which the citizen is otherwise entitled; and
WHEREAS, to the extent that a common law executive privilege exists, the Legislature intends to
replace the common law privilege with a statutory exemption defining the scope and limitations of the executive
exemption; and
WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that it is in the best interest of every Montanan and to further fidelity to
the Montana Constitution to better define and clarify the scope of the constitutional privacy protections and to
uphold the long and proud tradition of open government by providing access to the documents and
deliberations of state and local government while also increasing government accountability and transparency.

disclosure.

(3) The assertion of an executive exemption must be narrowly tailored to apply to only the specific
information in which the governor is claiming a privacy interest. The information for which the governor is
asserting the executive exemption may be redacted, but only to the narrowest extent possible. A person who
received public information with redaction may bring an action pursuant to 2-6-1009 alleging that the application
of an executive exemption is overly broad. The court shall review the redacted information and assess whether
the individual privacy interest clearly outweighs the merits of public disclosure.

of the exempted information serves its underlying purpose.
