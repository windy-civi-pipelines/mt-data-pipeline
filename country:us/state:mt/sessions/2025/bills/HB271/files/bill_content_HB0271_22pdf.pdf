16 WHEREAS, the Montana Constitution has enshrined access to public information in the Right to Know
17 in Article II, section 9, which states that "No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to
18 observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in
19 cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure"; and
20 WHEREAS, the Right of Participation in Article II, section 8, of the Montana Constitution also ensures
21 that the public must be given a reasonable opportunity to participate in the operation of governmental agencies
22 prior to the final decision as may be provided by law; and
23 WHEREAS, these fundamental rights are the foundation on which every Montanan is able to exercise
24 the power to hold elected officials accountable for their actions and decisions; and
25 WHEREAS, the Montana Supreme Court recently issued a decision in O'Neill v. Gianforte, 2025 MT 2,
26 holding that the Governor enjoys a common law-based executive privilege, which protects certain
27 communications and information from public disclosure; and
28 WHEREAS, the Legislature holds the power to change the common law through the proper and valid

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0271.2
1 enactment of legislation; and
2 WHEREAS, the process outlined by the majority in O'Neill is unwieldy and cumbersome, requiring an in
3 camera review by a court of all documents for which an executive privilege is asserted, causing substantial
4 costs to Montanans seeking records and to the state, adding to the workload of an already burdened judicial
5 system, and stalling the ability of a Montana citizen to receive the public information about the workings of
6 government to which the citizen is otherwise entitled; and
7 WHEREAS, to the extent that a common law executive privilege exists, the Legislature intends to
8 replace the common law privilege with a statutory exemption defining the scope and limitations of the executive
9 exemption; and
10 WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that it is in the best interest of every Montanan and to further fidelity to
11 the Montana Constitution to better define and clarify the scope of the constitutional privacy protections and to
12 uphold the long and proud tradition of open government by providing access to the documents and
13 deliberations of state and local government while also increasing government accountability and transparency.
14
15 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
16
17 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Limited executive exemption -- expiration of exemption. (1) The
18 governor may assert an executive exemption to withhold specific public information from a request for public
19 information under sections 2-6-1003 and 2-6-1006 only when the governor's individual privacy interest clearly
20 outweighs the merits of public disclosure.
21 (2) THE GOVERNOR DOES NOT HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY INTEREST IN PUBLIC INFORMATION
22 PERTAINING TO POLICY, POLITICS, OR LEGISLATIVE MATTERS.
23
24 (3) The assertion of an executive exemption must be narrowly tailored to apply to only the specific
25 information in which the governor is claiming a privacy interest. The information for which the governor is
26 asserting the executive exemption may be redacted, but only to the narrowest extent possible. A person who
27 received public information with redaction may bring an action pursuant to 2-6-1009 alleging that the application
28 of an executive exemption is overly broad. The court shall review the redacted information and assess whether
