10 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
11 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
12 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
13 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
14 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
15 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
16 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
17 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
18 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
19 sending a portion to other local governments.
20 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
21 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
22 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),
23 Chapter 584, Laws of 1999;

1 (n) state aeronautics fees pursuant to 67-3-101; and
2 (o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
3 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
4 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
5 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
6 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
7 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
8 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
9 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
10 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
11 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
12 year.
13 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
14 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
15 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
16 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
17 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
18 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
19 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
20 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
21 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
22 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
23 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
24 multiplied by 0.25.
25 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
26 the lesser of:
27 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
28 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 327
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0327.2
1 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
2 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
3 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
4 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
5 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005 years 2028, 2029, and 2030, a minimum of 1.024; and
6 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
7 (C) (B) for fiscal year 2020 2031 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The
8 rate must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been
9 calculated using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection
10 (4)(b)(ii).
11 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
12 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
13 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
14 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
15 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
16 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
17 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
18 2002.
19 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
20 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
21 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
22 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
23 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
24 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
25 be calculated separately for:
26 (A) counties;
27 (B) consolidated local governments; and
28 (C) incorporated cities and towns.

69th Legislature 2025 SB0327.2
1 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
2 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
3 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
4 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
5 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
6 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
7 United States bureau of the census.
8 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
9 follows:
10 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
11 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
12 and
13 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
14 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
15 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
16 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
17 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
18 follows:
19 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
20 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
21 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
22 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
23 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
24 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
25 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
26 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
27 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
28 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – SB 327
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0327.2
1 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
2 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
3 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
4 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
5 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
6 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
7 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
8 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
9 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
10 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
11 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
12 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
13 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
14 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
15 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
16 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
17 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
18 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
19 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
20 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
21 financing districts is as follows:
FLATHEAD Kalispell - District 2 $4,638
Flathead Kalispell - District 3 37,231
Flathead Whitefish District 148,194

3 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
4 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
5 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
6 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
7 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
8 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
9 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
10 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
11 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
12 (i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and

69th Legislature 2025 SB0327.2
1 SENATE BILL NO. 327
2 INTRODUCED BY G. HERTZ
3
4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT REVISING REGISTRATION FEES FOR VEHICLES; AND
5 AMENDING SECTIONS 15-1-121, 15-1-122, 61-3-321, AND 61-3-562, MCA.”
6
7 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
8
9 SECTION 1. Section 15-1-121, MCA, is amended to read:
10 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
11 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
12 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
13 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
14 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
15 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
16 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
17 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
18 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
19 sending a portion to other local governments.
20 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
21 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
22 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),
23 Chapter 584, Laws of 1999;

10 612(2)(a);

69th Legislature 2025 SB0327.2
1 (n) state aeronautics fees pursuant to 67-3-101; and
2 (o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
3 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
4 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
5 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
6 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
7 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
8 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
9 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
10 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
11 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
12 year.
13 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
14 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
15 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
16 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
17 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
18 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
19 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
20 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
21 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
22 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
23 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
24 multiplied by 0.25.
25 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
26 the lesser of:
27 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
28 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 327

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0327.2
1 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
2 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
3 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
4 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
5 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005 years 2028, 2029, and 2030, a minimum of 1.024; and
6 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
7 (C) (B) for fiscal year 2020 2031 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The
8 rate must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been
9 calculated using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection
10 (4)(b)(ii).
11 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
12 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
13 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
14 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
15 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
16 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
17 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
18 2002.
19 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
20 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
21 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
22 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
23 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
24 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
25 be calculated separately for:
26 (A) counties;
27 (B) consolidated local governments; and
28 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – SB 327

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0327.2
1 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
2 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
3 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
4 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
5 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
6 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
7 United States bureau of the census.
8 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
9 follows:
10 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
11 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
12 and
13 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
14 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
15 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
16 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
17 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
18 follows:
19 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
20 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
21 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
22 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
23 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
24 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
25 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
26 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
27 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
28 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – SB 327

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0327.2
1 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
2 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
3 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
