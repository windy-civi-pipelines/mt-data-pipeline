****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 241.1

12 (E) A distant state's psychology regulatory authority shall investigate and take appropriate action
13 with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a psychologist practicing under temporary

6 ARTICLE VI
7 CONDITIONS OF TELEPSYCHOLOGY PRACTICE
8 IN A RECEIVING STATE
9 (A) A psychologist may practice in a receiving state under the authority to practice
10 interjurisdictional telepsychology only in the performance of the scope of practice for psychology as assigned by
11 an appropriate state psychology regulatory authority as defined in the rules of the commission and under the
12 following circumstances:
13 (1) the psychologist initiates a client or patient contact in a home state via telecommunications
14 technologies with a client or patient in a receiving state; and
15 (2) other conditions regarding telepsychology as determined by the rules promulgated by the
16 commission.
17 ARTICLE VII
18 ADVERSE ACTIONS
19 (A) A home state must have the power to impose adverse action against a psychologist's license
20 issued by the home state. A distant state must have the power to take adverse action on a psychologist's
21 temporary authorization to practice in the distant state.
22 (B) A receiving state may take adverse action on a psychologist's authority to practice
23 interjurisdictional telepsychology within that receiving state. A home state may take adverse action against a
24 psychologist based on an adverse action taken by a distant state regarding temporary in-person, face-to-face
25 practice.
26 (C) If a home state takes adverse action against a psychologist's license, that psychologist's
27 authority to practice interjurisdictional telepsychology is terminated and the e.passport is revoked. The
28 psychologist's temporary authorization to practice is also terminated and the interjurisdictional practice
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – HB 241

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 241.1
1 certificate is revoked.
2 (1) All home state disciplinary action orders that impose adverse action must be reported to the

4 actions in accordance with the rules of the commission.

8 (D) A home state's psychology regulatory authority shall investigate and take appropriate action
9 with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a licensee that occurred in a receiving state as it
10 would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee within the home state. In such cases, the home state's law
11 must control in determining any adverse action against a psychologist's license.
12 (E) A distant state's psychology regulatory authority shall investigate and take appropriate action
13 with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a psychologist practicing under temporary
14 authorization practice that occurred in that distant state as it would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee

16 against a psychologist's temporary authorization to practice.
17 (F) Nothing in this compact may override a compact state's decision that a psychologist's
18 participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such participation must
19 remain nonpublic if required by the compact state's law. Compact states shall require psychologists who enter
20 any alternative programs to not provide telepsychology services under the authority to practice
21 interjurisdictional telepsychology or provide temporary psychological services under the temporary authorization
22 to practice in any other compact state during the term of the alternative program.
