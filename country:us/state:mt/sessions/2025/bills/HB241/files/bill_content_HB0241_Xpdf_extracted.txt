WHEREAS, this compact is intended to authorize state psychology regulatory authorities to afford legal
recognition, in a manner consistent with the terms of the compact, to psychologists licensed in another state;
and
WHEREAS, this compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health
and safety through their licensing and regulation of psychologists and that such state regulation will best protect
public health and safety; and
WHEREAS, this compact does not apply to the practice of psychology by a psychologist licensed in
both the home and receiving states; and

safety;
(3) encourage the cooperation of compact states in the areas of psychology licensure and
regulation;
(4) facilitate the exchange of information between compact states regarding psychologist
licensure, adverse actions, and disciplinary history;

the mutual recognition of compact state licenses.

ARTICLE VI
CONDITIONS OF TELEPSYCHOLOGY PRACTICE
IN A RECEIVING STATE
(A) A psychologist may practice in a receiving state under the authority to practice

issued by the home state. A distant state must have the power to take adverse action on a psychologist's
temporary authorization to practice in the distant state.
(B) A receiving state may take adverse action on a psychologist's authority to practice
interjurisdictional telepsychology within that receiving state. A home state may take adverse action against a
psychologist based on an adverse action taken by a distant state regarding temporary in-person, face-to-face
practice.
(C) If a home state takes adverse action against a psychologist's license, that psychologist's
authority to practice interjurisdictional telepsychology is terminated and the e.passport is revoked. The

ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 241
certificate is revoked.
(1) All home state disciplinary action orders that impose adverse action must be reported to the
commission in accordance with the rules promulgated by the commission. A compact state shall report adverse

(D) A home state's psychology regulatory authority shall investigate and take appropriate action
with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a licensee that occurred in a receiving state as it
would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee within the home state. In such cases, the home state's law
must control in determining any adverse action against a psychologist's license.
(E) A distant state's psychology regulatory authority shall investigate and take appropriate action
with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a psychologist practicing under temporary
authorization practice that occurred in that distant state as it would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee
within the home state. In such cases, the distant state's law must control in determining any adverse action
against a psychologist's temporary authorization to practice.
(F) Nothing in this compact may override a compact state's decision that a psychologist's
participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such participation must
remain nonpublic if required by the compact state's law. Compact states shall require psychologists who enter
any alternative programs to not provide telepsychology services under the authority to practice
interjurisdictional telepsychology or provide temporary psychological services under the temporary authorization
to practice in any other compact state during the term of the alternative program.
(G) No other judicial or administrative remedies may be available to a psychologist in the event a

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 241
regulatory authority must have the authority under this compact to:
(1) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and
testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a compact state's psychology
regulatory authority for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence, or both, from
another compact state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction according to
that court's practice and procedure in considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing state
psychology regulatory authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required
by the service statutes of the state where the witnesses or evidence are located.

practice interjurisdictional telepsychology and temporary authorization to practice.
(3) During the course of any investigation, a psychologist may not change the psychologist's home
state licensure. A home state psychology regulatory authority is authorized to complete any pending
investigations of a psychologist and to take any actions appropriate under its law. The home state psychology
regulatory authority shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the commission. Once an
investigation has been completed, and pending the outcomes of the investigation, the psychologist may change
the psychologist's home state licensure. The commission shall promptly notify the new home state of any such
decisions as provided in the rules of the commission. All information provided to the commission or distributed
by compact states pursuant to the psychologist must be confidential, filed under seal, and used for investigatory
or disciplinary matters. The commission may create additional rules for mandated or discretionary sharing of
information by compact states.
ARTICLE IX
COORDINATED LICENSURE INFORMATION SYSTEM

information system and reporting system containing licensure and disciplinary action information on all
psychologist individuals to whom this compact is applicable in all compact states as defined by the rules of the
commission.

both the home and receiving states; and
WHEREAS, this compact does not apply to permanent in-person, face-to-face practice, but it does
allow for authorization of temporary psychological practice.
Consistent with these principles, this compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and

regulation;

licensure, adverse actions, and disciplinary history;

the mutual recognition of compact state licenses.

ENROLLED BILL

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 241

must control in determining any adverse action against a psychologist's license.
(E) A distant state's psychology regulatory authority shall investigate and take appropriate action
with respect to reported inappropriate conduct engaged in by a psychologist practicing under temporary
authorization practice that occurred in that distant state as it would if such conduct had occurred by a licensee

(F) Nothing in this compact may override a compact state's decision that a psychologist's
participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such participation must
remain nonpublic if required by the compact state's law. Compact states shall require psychologists who enter
any alternative programs to not provide telepsychology services under the authority to practice
interjurisdictional telepsychology or provide temporary psychological services under the temporary authorization
to practice in any other compact state during the term of the alternative program.

resolution for disputes that arise before the commission.

the northern, middle, or southern districts of Georgia or the federal district where the commission has its
principal offices against a compact state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact
and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the
event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member must be awarded all costs of such litigation,
including reasonable attorney fees.
