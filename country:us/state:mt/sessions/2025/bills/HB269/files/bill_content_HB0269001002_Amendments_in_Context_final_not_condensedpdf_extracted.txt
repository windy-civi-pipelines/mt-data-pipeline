13 by governor to U.S. secretary of agriculture -- -- administration by department. (1) Upon petition by 50%
14 or more of certified organic producers, processors, and handlers in Montana, the department shall develop a
15 plan for a state organic certification program for producers and handlers of agricultural products that have been
16 produced using organic methods. The plan must be developed in conformity with the requirements of the
17 Organic Foods Production Act of 1990, 7 U.S.C. 6501, et seq. The state program must be designed to ensure
18 that a product that is sold or labeled as organically produced is produced and handled using organic methods.
19 The state organic certification program may contain requirements that are more restrictive than those contained
20 in the federal act for the organic certification of farms and handling operations and the production and handling
21 of agricultural products that are to be sold or labeled as organically produced.
22 (2) Once the plan is developed, the governor, as the governing state official, shall submit the plan
23 for a Montana state organic certification program to the U.S. secretary of agriculture for approval.
24 (3) If the state program is approved by the U.S. secretary of agriculture, two-thirds of the certified
25 organic producers, processors, and handlers who petitioned for development of a state plan pursuant to
26 subsection (1) may petition the department for implementation of the Montana state organic certification
27 program.
28 (4) Upon receipt and verification of the petition, the department shall implement the program.

12 (e) appropriate penalty and enforcement provisions applicable to the state organic certification
13 program;
14 (f) the awarding of research and marketing contracts; and

24 budget requirements or if the private certifiers are providing full coverage of the state.
25 (5)(4) A state organic certification program may not be construed to apply to organic producers,
26 processors, and handlers certified solely by other organic certification programs, whether public, private,
27 foreign, or domestic, nor may the state organic certification program prohibit those other certifying organizations
28 from certifying and collecting fees from organic producers, processors, handlers, or any other commercial entity
