69th Legislature HJ 74
MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY EXAMINING WATER REUSE; AND REQUIRING THAT THE
FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, Montana's water resources are of exceptional quality and are a valuable resource to the
residents of the state; and
WHEREAS, water reuse, also known as water recycling, is a process in which wastewater is purified
for a designated beneficial freshwater purpose; and
WHEREAS, the potential uses of recycled water include agricultural, industrial, and municipal
purposes; and
WHEREAS, water reuse is a tool to promote sustainable and resilient water supplies and protect
environmentally sensitive resources; and
WHEREAS, there may exist technical, regulatory, financial, and educational roadblocks preventing the
implementation of water reuse programs in Montana; and
WHEREAS, individualizing levels of treatment for specific uses is more cost and energy efficient than a
standardized treatment approach; and
WHEREAS, opportunities for water reuse may be underexplored in Montana.

THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
