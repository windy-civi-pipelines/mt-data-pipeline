69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Griffin Burns, HB0877.001.002
1 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Policy and intent. (1) October 1, 2007, marked the end of deregulation
2 in the state, which eliminated customer choice for electricity supply and initiated the rebuilding of certain public
3 utilities into vertically integrated enterprises.
4 (2) The end of deregulation in the state eliminated customer choice in electric supply while
5 preserving the choices that had been made by customers in existence on or before October 1, 2007.
6 (3) The public service commission has an important role in determining how large electric
7 customer needs are met, but that role does not extend to prohibiting large electric customers from obtaining
8 service from certain public utilities.
9 (4) It is the legislature's intent to clarify the commission's role and to clarify how new, large
10 customers may obtain electric service in order to address the opportunities and challenges that new, large
11 loads present, particularly with the rapid emergence of data centers and other large-scale energy consumers.
12
13 Section 3. Section 69-8-201, MCA, is amended to read:

17 demand of greater than or equal to 5,000 kilowatts, and that is not purchasing electricity supply service from a
18 public utility on October 1, 2007, may not purchase electricity supply service from a public utility.
19 (b) A retail customer referred to in subsection (1)(a) may, but is under no obligation to, request
20 electricity supply service from the public utility, and the public utility shall provide electricity supply service if the
21 retail customer demonstrates that the provision of electricity supply service to the retail customer will not
22 adversely impact the public utility's other customers over the long term as determined by the commission.
23 (c) If a public utility provides electricity supply service to a retail customer as provided in
24 subsection (1)(b), that service is regulated by the commission and the customer may not, at a later date,
25 purchase electricity supply service from another provider of electricity supply service.
26 (d) The commission may not prohibit a public utility from providing service to a retail customer that
27 came into existence after October 1, 2007, and that has an individual load with an average monthly demand of

1 greater than or equal to 5,000 kilowatts.

7 an average monthly demand of less than 5,000 kilowatts, and that is not purchasing electricity from a public
8 utility on October 1, 2007, may continue to purchase electricity from an electricity supplier. The retail customer
9 may subsequently purchase electricity from a public utility subject to commission rule or order, but the customer
10 may not, at a later date, choose to purchase electricity from another source.
11 (b) A retail customer that has an individual load with an average monthly demand of less than
12 5,000 kilowatts and that is currently purchasing electricity from a public utility may not choose to purchase
13 electricity from another source after October 1, 2007.
14 (3) Nothing in this section affects a retail customer's rights and obligations with respect to net
15 metering, cogeneration, self-generation, or ancillary sales of electricity related to deviations from scheduled
16 energy deliveries from nonutility suppliers, as may be provided for in law, commission rule or order, or a tariff
17 approved by the public service commission or the federal energy regulatory commission.
18 (4) (a) Except as provided in 69-5-101, 69-5-102, 69-5-104(2), 69-5-105 through 69-5-112, 69-8-
19 402, 69-8-421, and subsection (4)(b) of this section, a public utility currently doing business in Montana as part
20 of a single integrated multistate operation, no portion of which lies within the basin of the Columbia River, is
21 exempt from the requirements of this chapter.
22 (b) To the extent that a public utility described in subsection (4)(a) becomes the successor in
23 interest of another public utility that has restructured in accordance with this chapter before October 1, 2007, it
