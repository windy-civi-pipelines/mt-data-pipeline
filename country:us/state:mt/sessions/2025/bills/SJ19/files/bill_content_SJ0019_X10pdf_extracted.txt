69th Legislature 2025 SJ 19
MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY ON WAYS TO IMPROVE PASSENGER TRANSPORTATION
SERVICE AND PUBLIC TRANSIT IN MONTANA; AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE
STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, passenger rail, passenger air, public transit, and passenger bus services provide mobility
for senior citizens, persons with disabilities, students, tourists, and businesspeople; and
WHEREAS, some communities in the state are poorly served by public transportation, and options for
passenger transportation services in the state continue to decline; and
WHEREAS, the Hi-Line is Montana's major northern transportation corridor, consisting of U.S. Highway
2 and the BNSF Railway, and yet the local residents face challenges with the available methods of
transportation. Air travel is another key method of transportation for Hi-Line residents to get to hospital
appointments in Billings over 200 miles south in a timely manner, and the residents would benefit from
increased air travel locations and options; and
WHEREAS, if state services are unavailable, many Montanans need local, tribal, or county
transportation services for help getting to appointments for medical or other physical needs; and
WHEREAS, the Amtrak North Coast Hiawatha ceased operation through southern Montana in 1979,
and transportation to and from the major population centers of southern Montana would be greatly enhanced by
passenger rail service; and
WHEREAS, additional passenger transportation services will increase passenger transportation-related
employment opportunities because of the need for upgraded infrastructure and operating personnel; and
WHEREAS, tourism is the State of Montana's second-largest industry and would be enhanced by
improved passenger transportation services and public transit; and

ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature 2025 SJ 19
WHEREAS, the Amtrak Empire Builder is one of the most popular long-distance passenger trains in the
United States, and it is greatly needed for the citizens of Montana's Hi-Line who have limited public
transportation options, but it is challenged by a lack of rail capacity that results in frequent delays; and
WHEREAS, there is currently no board or commission within the state that is charged with the sole
responsibility of overseeing and advocating for passenger transportation services, including passenger rail,
passenger air, public transit, and passenger bus services; and
WHEREAS, autonomous vehicles may provide one option for transportation needs in the state in the
future, and more studies are needed to determine whether laws need to be updated to accommodate
autonomous vehicles and to determine whether policies are necessary to address safety, licensing, and other
issues of public concern.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
committee, pursuant to section 5-5-217, MCA, or direct sufficient staff resources to investigate ways to improve
passenger transportation and public transit services in the state, including but not limited to the establishment of
a passenger transportation commission and a review of applicable laws that may need updating to allow the
use of autonomous vehicles and provide for public safety.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the study is assigned to staff, any findings or conclusions be
presented to and reviewed by an appropriate committee designated by the Legislative Council.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all aspects of the study, including presentation and review
requirements, be concluded prior to September 15, 2026.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the final results of the study, including any findings, conclusions,
comments, or recommendations of the appropriate committee, be reported to the 70th Legislature.
