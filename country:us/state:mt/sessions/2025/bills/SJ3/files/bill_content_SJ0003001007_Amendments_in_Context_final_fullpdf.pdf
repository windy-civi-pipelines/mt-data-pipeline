4
5 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
6 MONTANA URGING THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO REVISE COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE
7 LAWS.
8
9 WHEREAS, federal requirements for commercial driver's licenses are cumbersome and confusing; and
10 WHEREAS, state governments are burdened with explaining and enforcing commercial driver's license
11 laws; and
12 WHEREAS, requiring commercial driver's licenses for small haulers unreasonably burdens small
13 businesses and seems irrational when compared to the lack of federal regulation on hauling recreational
14 vehicles; and
15 WHEREAS, requiring commercial driver's licenses for school bus drivers is a time-consuming and
16 costly burden on rural school districts and their drivers, who are often senior citizens offering to do this vital
17 work as a service to their community.
18
19 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
20 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
21 That the Montana Legislature Urges urges the United States Congress to revise commercial driver's
22 license laws so that a person driving a pickup truck hauling nonhazardous material on a single trailer does not
23 need a commercial driver's license.
24 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Montana Legislature urges the United States Congress to
25 revise commercial driver's license laws so that school buses have a less burdensome and less costly level of
26 licensure that is appropriate to the specific requirements of driving a school bus with children.
27 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State send a copy of this resolution to each
28 member of the Montana Congressional Delegation, to the members of the Transportation and Infrastructure
