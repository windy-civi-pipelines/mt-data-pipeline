Section 1:
69th Legislature - 2025 SJ 3
MONTANA URGING THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO REVISE COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE
LAWS.
WHEREAS, federal requirements for commercial driver's licenses are cumbersome and confusing; and
WHEREAS, state governments are burdened with explaining and enforcing commercial driver's license
laws;
WHEREAS, requiring commercial driver's licenses for small haulers unreasonably burdens small
businesses and seems irrational when compared to the lack of federal regulation on hauling recreational
vehicles; and
WHEREAS, requiring commercial driver's licenses for school bus drivers is a time-consuming and
costly burden on rural school districts and their drivers, who are often senior citizens offering to do this vital
work as a service to their community.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the Montana Legislature urges the United States Congress to revise commercial driver's license
laws so that a person driving a pickup truck hauling nonhazardous material on a single trailer does not need a
commercial driver's license.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Montana Legislature urges the United States Congress to
revise commercial driver's license laws so that school buses have a less burdensome and less costly level of
licensure that is appropriate to the specific requirements of driving a school bus with children.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State send a copy of this resolution to each
