CONFORMITY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS
As required pursuant to section 5-11-112(1)(c), MCA, it is the Legislative Services Division's
statutory responsibility to conduct "legal review of draft bills". The comments noted below
regarding conformity with state and federal constitutions are provided to assist the Legislature
in making its own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill. The comments are based
on an analysis of jurisdictionally relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the
bill. The comments are not written for the purpose of influencing whether the bill should
become law but are written to provide information relevant to the Legislature's consideration
of this bill. The comments are not a formal legal opinion and are not a substitute for the
judgment of the judiciary, which has the authority to determine the constitutionality of a law
in the context of a specific case.
This review is intended to inform the bill draft requestor of potential constitutional conformity
issues that may be raised by the bill as drafted. This review IS NOT dispositive of the issue of
constitutional conformity and the general rule as repeatedly stated by the Montana Supreme
Court is that an enactment of the Legislature is presumed to be constitutional unless it is
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the enactment is unconstitutional. See Alexander v.
Bozeman Motors, Inc., 356 Mont. 439, 234 P.3d 880 (2010); Eklund v. Wheatland County,
351 Mont. 370, 212 P.3d 297 (2009); St. v. Pyette, 337 Mont. 265, 159 P.3d 232 (2007); and
Elliott v. Dept. of Revenue, 334 Mont. 195, 146 P.3d 741 (2006).
Legal Reviewer Comments:
SB 21, as drafted, amends section 27-26-102, MCA, which addresses writs of mandamus and in
which cases one should be issued. SB 21 inserts a new subsection (3) that provides as follows:
(3) (a) When a writ of mandamus is issued to compel an elected official listed in
Article VI, section 1, of the Montana constitution, an individual legislator, or the
legislature as a whole or in part, to produce documents or to perform or not to perform an

action, the president of the senate or the speaker of the house may file a pleading that
vacates the writ in the court which issued it. The filing must be signed by either the
president or the speaker and either the governor or the attorney general and be filed
within ten business days of the writ's issuance by the court.
(b) When a writ is vacated pursuant to this subsection, the writ is considered vacated,
is unenforceable, and may not be executed upon.
(c) An elected official for whom a notice vacating a writ of mandamus pursuant to
this subsection may not be found in either civil or criminal contempt of court
SB 21, as drafted, may raise a potential separation of powers issue to the extent it allows
legislative and executive officers to vacate a writ of mandamus that has been issued by a court of
law.
The separation of powers clause of the Montana Constitution at Article III, section 1, provides:
Separation of powers. The power of the government of this state is divided into
three distinct branches--legislative, executive, and judicial. No person or persons
charged with the exercise of power properly belonging to one branch shall
exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except as in this
constitution expressly directed or permitted.
