69th Legislature 2025 HB 655
FOSTER CARE SERVICES BASED ON THE PERSON'S RELIGIOUS BELIEF; PROVIDING DEFINITIONS;
PROVIDING REMEDIES; AND PROVIDING A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
WHEREAS, the State of Montana seeks to place a child in a safe, loving, and supportive home
whenever the state is required to place a child with an adoptive or foster family; and
WHEREAS, adoption and foster care agencies in Montana assist families with adoption and foster
parent placements of children; and
WHEREAS, the adoption agencies and foster care providers of this state represent diverse
organizations and groups, some of which are faith-based and some of which are nonfaith-based; and
WHEREAS, children in need of placement services benefit from having as many adoption agencies
and foster care providers as possible because the more agencies and providers that take part in placement
services, the greater the likelihood that a child will find a permanent placement; and
WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868 (2021),
recognized the benefits of having more and not fewer adoption agencies and foster care providers, stating that
"[m]aximizing the number of foster families and minimizing liability are important goals, but the City fails to show
that granting [Catholic Social Services] an exception will put those goals at risk. If anything, including CSS in
the program seems likely to increase, not reduce, the number of available foster parents"; and
WHEREAS, children and families benefit greatly from the adoption and foster care services provided by
faith-based and nonfaith-based child placing agencies; and
WHEREAS, faith-based organizations and groups have a lengthy and distinguished history of providing
adoption and foster care services in Montana; and
WHEREAS, private child-placing agencies and individuals, including faith-based child-placing agencies
and individuals, have the right to free exercise of religion under both the state and federal constitutions, which,
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – HB 655
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 655
under well-settled principles of constitutional law, includes the freedom to abstain from conduct that conflicts
with an agency's sincerely held religious beliefs; and
WHEREAS, ensuring that faith-based child-placing agencies can continue to provide adoption and
foster care services will benefit the children and families who receive those services; and
WHEREAS, the United States Constitution allows all adoption and foster care providers to operate
according to their beliefs without fear of unjust government punishment; and
WHEREAS, in the unanimous decision in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, the U.S. Supreme Court made
clear that state governments violate the requirements of religious neutrality when they undermine religious
beliefs or practices and that the "[g]overnment fails to act neutrally when it proceeds in a manner intolerant of
religious beliefs or restricts practices because of their religious nature"; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Supreme Court in Espinoza v. Montana Dept. of Revenue, 140 S. Ct. 2246, 2276
(2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring), stated that "[t]he Constitution forbids laws that prohibit the free exercise of
religion. That guarantee protects not just the right to be a religious person, holding beliefs inwardly and secretly;
it also protects the right to act on those beliefs outwardly and publicly [italics removed]"; and
WHEREAS, the Espinoza Court noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has "long recognized the
importance of protecting religious actions, not just religious status" and, quoting Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310
U.S. 296, 3030 (1940), state that "the First Amendment protects the 'freedom to act' as well as the 'freedom to
believe'"; and
WHEREAS, in Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Security Div., 450 U.S. 707, 717-718 (1981),
the U.S. Supreme Court held that the government violates the Free Exercise Clause whenever it "conditions
receipt of an important benefit upon conduct prescribed by a religious faith, or... denies such a benefit because
of conduct mandated by a religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his
behavior and to violate his beliefs."
