5 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATORY ACTION AGAINST A PERSON
6 PROVIDING ADOPTION OR FOSTER CARE SERVICES BASED ON THE PERSON'S RELIGIOUS BELIEF;
7 PROVIDING DEFINITIONS; PROVIDING REMEDIES; AND PROVIDING A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.”

9 WHEREAS, the State of Montana seeks to place a child in a safe, loving, and supportive home
10 whenever the state is required to place a child with an adoptive or foster family; and
11 WHEREAS, adoption and foster care agencies in Montana assist families with adoption and foster
12 parent placements of children; and
13 WHEREAS, the adoption agencies and foster care providers of this state represent diverse
14 organizations and groups, some of which are faith-based and some of which are nonfaith-based; and
15 WHEREAS, children in need of placement services benefit from having as many adoption agencies
16 and foster care providers as possible because the more agencies and providers that take part in placement
17 services, the greater the likelihood that a child will find a permanent placement; and
18 WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868 (2021),
19 recognized the benefits of having more and not fewer adoption agencies and foster care providers, stating that
20 "[m]aximizing the number of foster families and minimizing liability are important goals, but the City fails to show
21 that granting [Catholic Social Services] an exception will put those goals at risk. If anything, including CSS in
22 the program seems likely to increase, not reduce, the number of available foster parents"; and
23 WHEREAS, children and families benefit greatly from the adoption and foster care services provided by
24 faith-based and nonfaith-based child placing agencies; and
25 WHEREAS, faith-based organizations and groups have a lengthy and distinguished history of providing
26 adoption and foster care services in Montana; and
27 WHEREAS, private child-placing agencies and individuals, including faith-based child-placing agencies

1 and individuals, have the right to free exercise of religion under both the state and federal constitutions, which,
2 under well-settled principles of constitutional law, includes the freedom to abstain from conduct that conflicts
3 with an agency's sincerely held religious beliefs; and
4 WHEREAS, ensuring that faith-based child-placing agencies can continue to provide adoption and
5 foster care services will benefit the children and families who receive those services; and
6 WHEREAS, the United States Constitution allows all adoption and foster care providers agencies to
7 operate according to their beliefs without fear of unjust government punishment; and
8 WHEREAS, in the unanimous decision in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, the U.S. Supreme Court made
9 clear that state governments violate the requirements of religious neutrality when they undermine religious
10 beliefs or practices and that the "[g]overnment fails to act neutrally when it proceeds in a manner intolerant of
11 religious beliefs or restricts practices because of their religious nature"; and
12 WHEREAS, the U.S. Supreme Court in Espinoza v. Montana Dept. of Revenue, 140 S. Ct. 2246, 2276
13 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring), stated that "[t]he Constitution forbids laws that prohibit the free exercise of
14 religion. That guarantee protects not just the right to be a religious person, holding beliefs inwardly and secretly;
15 it also protects the right to act on those beliefs outwardly and publicly [italics removed]"; and
16 WHEREAS, the Espinoza Court noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has "long recognized the
17 importance of protecting religious actions, not just religious status" and, quoting Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310
18 U.S. 296, 3030 (1940), state that "the First Amendment protects the 'freedom to act' as well as the 'freedom to
19 believe'"; and
20 WHEREAS, in Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment Security Div., 450 U.S. 707, 717-718 (1981),
21 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the government violates the Free Exercise Clause whenever it "conditions
22 receipt of an important benefit upon conduct prescribed by a religious faith, or... denies such a benefit because
23 of conduct mandated by a religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his
24 behavior and to violate his beliefs."
