26 economic loss, personal injury, property damage, or wrongful death for which the action is brought;
27 (ii) the product is subject to a government-mandated product recall related to consumer safety,

11 liability action that is otherwise within this section and is not barred by any other provision of law must be
12 brought no later than 2 years following the expiration of that period certain.

14 death, or property, or economic damage was not in a defective condition that is unreasonably dangerous and
15 that the manufacturer or seller of the product was not negligent. The jury must be informed of this presumption
16 if at the time the product was first sold or leased to any person or otherwise placed into the stream of

4 and drug administration to remove the product at issue from the market or to withdraw its approval.

23 the manufacturer of the product;
24 (f) personal jurisdiction over the manufacturer cannot be obtained in the state;

14 death, or property, or economic damage was not in a defective condition that is unreasonably dangerous and
15 that the manufacturer or seller of the product was not negligent. The jury must be informed of this presumption
16 if at the time the product was first sold or leased to any person or otherwise placed into the stream of
17 commerce:
18 (a) the product at issue's formula, design, labeling, warning, or instructions complied with
19 mandatory safety statutes, standards, or regulations adopted by the federal or state government or an agency
20 of the federal or state government that were applicable to the product at issue at the time of its manufacture
21 and that addressed the product risk that allegedly caused harm;
22 (b) the product at issue was subject to premarket licensing or approval by the federal or state
23 government or an agency of the federal or state government, the seller complied with all of the government's or
24 agency's procedures and requirements pertaining to premarketing licensing or approval, and the product was

3 (iv) was not sold in the United States after the effective date of any order of the United States food
4 and drug administration to remove the product at issue from the market or to withdraw its approval.
5 (8) A product liability action may not be commenced or maintained against a seller who is not also
6 a manufacturer unless the claimant proves by a preponderance of evidence that:
7 (a) the seller actually exercised substantial control over some aspect of the manufacture,
8 construction, design, formula, installation, preparation, assembly, testing, packaging, labeling, warnings, and
9 instructions of the product that was a proximate cause of the damages for which the claimant seeks recovery;
10 (b) the seller altered, modified, or installed the product after it left the manufacturer's possession,

14 (c) the seller failed to exercise reasonable care with regard to the assembly, maintenance, service,
15 or repair of the product at issue or in conveying to the claimant the manufacturer's labels, warnings, or
16 instructions, and this failure was a proximate cause of the damages for which the claimant seeks recovery;
17 (d) the seller made an express factual representation regarding the product independent of any
18 express warranty made by a manufacturer regarding the product, the product failed to conform to the seller's
19 independent express warranty, the claimant relied on the express factual representation, and the failure of the
20 product to conform to the seller's independent express warranty was a proximate cause of the damages for
21 which the claimant seeks recovery;
22 (e) the manufacturer cannot be identified, despite a good-faith exercise of due diligence to identify
23 the manufacturer of the product;
24 (f) personal jurisdiction over the manufacturer cannot be obtained in the state;
25 (g) the manufacturer has been adjudicated bankrupt and a judgment is not otherwise recoverable
26 from the assets of the manufacturer's bankruptcy estate; or
27 (h) the seller had actual knowledge that the product contained a defect at the time the seller
28 placed the product into the stream of commerce, and that known defect was a proximate cause of the damages
