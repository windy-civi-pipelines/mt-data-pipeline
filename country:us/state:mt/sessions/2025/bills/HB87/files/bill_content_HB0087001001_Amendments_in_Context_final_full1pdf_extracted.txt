14 annually with the department a copy of its federal tax return reporting any unrelated business taxable income

23 years that the property was tax-exempt under this section. The amount due is a lien upon the property and
24 when collected must be distributed by the treasurer to funds and accounts in the same ratio as property tax
25 collected on the property is distributed. At the time the exemption is granted, the department shall file a notice
26 with the clerk and recorder in the county in which the property is located. The notice must indicate that an
27 exemption pursuant to this section has been granted. The notice must describe the penalty for default under
