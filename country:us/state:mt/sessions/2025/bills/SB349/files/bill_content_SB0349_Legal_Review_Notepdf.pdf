CONFORMITY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS
As required pursuant to section 5-11-112(1)(c), MCA, it is the Legislative Services Division's
statutory responsibility to conduct "legal review of draft bills". The comments noted below
regarding conformity with state and federal constitutions are provided to assist the Legislature
in making its own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill. The comments are based
on an analysis of jurisdictionally relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the
bill. The comments are not written for the purpose of influencing whether the bill should
become law but are written to provide information relevant to the Legislature's consideration
of this bill. The comments are not a formal legal opinion and are not a substitute for the
judgment of the judiciary, which has the authority to determine the constitutionality of a law
in the context of a specific case.
This review is intended to inform the bill draft requestor of potential constitutional conformity
issues that may be raised by the bill as drafted. This review IS NOT dispositive of the issue of
constitutional conformity and the general rule as repeatedly stated by the Montana Supreme
Court is that an enactment of the Legislature is presumed to be constitutional unless it is
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the enactment is unconstitutional. See Alexander v.
Bozeman Motors, Inc., 356 Mont. 439, 234 P.3d 880 (2010); Eklund v. Wheatland County,
351 Mont. 370, 212 P.3d 297 (2009); St. v. Pyette, 337 Mont. 265, 159 P.3d 232 (2007); and
Elliott v. Dept. of Revenue, 334 Mont. 195, 146 P.3d 741 (2006).
Legal Reviewer Comments:
As drafted, SB 349generally provides that the Montana Department of Environmental Quality
has authority over existing fossil-fuel fired electric generating units within the state of Montana.
Specifically, new section 2 provides:

NEW SECTION. Section 2. Policy and requirements for fossil-fuel
generating units within borders of state. (1) Environmental regulations as it relates to
fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in the state for the purposes of regulating air
quality, water quality, and emissions and business activity performed in the state is the
principal responsibility of the department of environmental quality.
(2) The department of environmental quality shall be the sole oversight and
permitting authority for existing fossil-fuel fired electric generating units, relating to air
quality, water quality and emissions standards, pursuant to Title 75, chapter 1, chapter 2,
and chapter 5.
Supremacy Clause
Air quality, water quality, hazardous waste disposal, and emission standards are regulated under
the federal Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Resource Conversation and Recovery
Act. Thus, these acts provide that the federal programs supersede state regulation.
The Supremacy Clause under the United States Constitution, Art. VI, cl. 2. This clause provides
that the Constitution, federal laws passed pursuant to the Constitution, and treaties made under
the Constitution's authority constitute the supreme law of the land. Under the Supremacy Clause,
if a conflict between state law and federal law exists, federal law prevails. California v. ARC
America Corp., 490 U.S. 93 (1989), and Jones v. Rath Packing, 430 U.S. 519 (1977).
As drafted, SB 349 may raise potential federal constitutional issues related to the Supremacy
Clause in that it proposes to supersede federal law relating to fossil-fuel fired electric generating
units permitting and enforcement.
Commerce Clause
The Commerce clause under the United States Constitution, Art. I, Section 8, cl. 3, broadly gives
Congress the power â€œto regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states,
and with the Indian tribes."
The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held that the Commerce Clause is a grant of plenary
authority to Congress, meaning it is a power which is "complete in itself, may be exercised to its
utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution."
Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining & Reclamation Ass'n, 452 U.S. 264, 276-277 (1981).
The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the Commerce Clause's power to regulate interstate
commerce extends to "the use of channels of interstate or foreign commerce and to protection of
the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or things in commerce." Id. [internal
citations omitted]. The Court has clarified that, due to the broad scope of the Commerce Clause,
"even activity that is purely intrastate in character may be regulated by Congress, where the
activity [...] affects commerce among the States." Id. at 277.
As drafted, SB 349 may potentially implicate the Commerce Clause and U.S. Supreme Court
precedent. The Court has consistently held that the broad scope of the Commerce Clause extends

to intrastate activities.
