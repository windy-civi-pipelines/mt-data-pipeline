in the safe handling of firearms and for that purpose may cooperate with any reputable organization having as

completion from Montana's hunter safety and education course to a person successfully completing the course.
(5) The department shall provide for a course of instruction from the national bowhunter education
foundation or any other bowhunter education program approved by the department and for that purpose may

(e) a Class A-3 deer A tag;
(f) a Class A-5 elk tag;

subsection (2)(g) does not prohibit a resident minor from purchasing any individual licenses for which the minor
may be eligible under this chapter if the minor does not purchase a Class AAA license under this subsection
(2)(g). A resident minor who lawfully purchases a Class AAA license pursuant to this subsection (2)(g) at 17
years of age, but who reaches 18 years of age during that license year, may legally use the license during that
license year.
(3) A nonresident minor who is 12 years of age or older and under 18 years of age may purchase

threatening illness. In order for a youth to qualify for the free license, the department must receive
documentation that the youth has been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness from a licensed physician. The
free special permit license may be issued to a youth on a one-time basis for only one hunting season. As used
in this subsection, "life-threatening illness" means any progressive, degenerative, or malignant disease or
condition that results in a significant threat, likelihood, or certainty that the child's life expectancy will not extend
past the child's 19th birthday unless the course of the disease is interrupted or abated.
(b) In exercising hunting privileges, the youth must be accompanied by an adult in possession of a
valid Montana hunting license or of a licensed Montana outfitter and conduct all hunting within the terms and

youth prior to and during the hunt.
