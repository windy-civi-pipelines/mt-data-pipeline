10 WHEREAS, in 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order establishing an Electric Vehicle
11 mandate for new passenger cars and light trucks; and
12 WHEREAS, Montanans use and rely on gas-powered vehicles for personal, business, and recreational
13 purposes; and

15 and other lands; and
16 WHEREAS, the average range of an Electric Vehicle falls between 110 and 300 miles; and
17 WHEREAS, current availability of electric charging stations is intermittent across the state of Montana.
18 Those electric charging stations that are available are commonly within city limits or urban areas.

20 around Montana in an Electric Vehicle; and
21 WHEREAS, the surface and quality of Montana's backroads and gravel roads often requires vehicles

8 Vehicle mandate and to promote true customer choice.
