10 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Required setback for wind turbine generators. After [the effective date
11 of this act], a wind turbine generator built pursuant to a wind energy agreement as described in 70-17-406 may
12 not be constructed if the wind turbine tower is 500 feet or more in height, as measured from the natural ground
13 level at the base of the tower to the tip of the turbine rotor blade, and if the base of the tower is located at a
14 distance of less than 1,5001,400 feet from an occupied residence that is subject to a wind energy agreement as
15 described in 70-17-406 with the owner of the wind turbine generator, unless the a shorter setback distance is
16 approved by the owner of the real property.

18 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Wind turbine generator deicing -- requirement. A After [the effective
19 date of this act], a wind turbine generator constructed after [the effective date of this act] that is shall use
20 commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate icing risks during an operator-controlled turbine rotor blade deicing
21 process if the wind turbine generator is:
22 (1) 500 feet or more in height, as measured from the natural ground level at the base of the tower
23 to the tip of the turbine rotor blade,;
24 (2) constructed within an area with an ice class rating of 4 or more, as defined in international
25 energy agency guidelines published in February 2017; and
26 (3) is located within a distance of 2,500 1,400 feet from an occupied residence in accordance with
27 [section 1] may not exceed 10% of the maximum turbine rotor blade speed during the turbine rotor blade

3 Section 3. Section 70-17-406, MCA, is amended to read:
4 "70-17-406. Wind energy agreement -- contents and requirements -- notarization -- fee. (1) A
5 wind energy agreement executed after April 21, 2011 January 1, 2026, must contain but is not limited to:
6 (a) the names and addresses of the parties to the wind energy agreement;
7 (b) a legal description of the real property subject to the wind easement and contained in the wind
8 energy agreement;
9 (c) the obligations of the owner of the real property to ensure the undisturbed flow of wind on and
10 over the real property, including restrictions placed upon vegetation, structures, and other objects that would
11 impair or obstruct the wind flow on and over the real property. Structures do not include equipment necessary
12 to access minerals as they relate to the rights belonging to or the dominance of the mineral estate pursuant to
13 70-17-408.
14 (d) a specified term including the date on which the wind energy agreement or wind easement
15 terminates;
16 (e) provisions to compensate the owner of the real property for the wind easement;
17 (f) provisions ensuring that the owner of the real property is not liable for any property tax
18 associated with the wind energy project or other equipment related to the development of the wind energy
19 project during the term of the wind energy agreement;
20 (g) provisions addressing property owner and wind energy developer liability during the
21 construction and operation of the wind energy project and equipment;
22 (h) provisions obligating the wind energy developer to comply with federal, state, and local laws
23 and regulations; and
24 (i) conditions upon which the wind energy agreement may be terminated prior to its termination
25 date.
26 (2) A wind energy agreement must be notarized.
27 (3) If the terms of the wind energy agreement do not contain the requirements listed in subsection
