22 (1), a court may void the wind energy agreement or order any relief allowed by law.
23 (4) (a) Within 30 days after the agreement has been notarized and prior to construction, a wind
24 energy agreement and a micrositing map must be filed with the department of environmental quality, along with
25 a $100 filing fee, for energy development tracking purposes.
26 (b) A wind energy agreement and a micrositing map filed with the department of environmental
27 quality may be amended prior to or after the completion of the wind turbine generator construction."
