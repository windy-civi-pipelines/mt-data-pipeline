contain sufficient money to reimburse claims for completed remedial actions, a reimbursement may not be
made and the orphan share account, the department, and the state are not liable for making any
reimbursement for the costs. The department and the state are not liable for any penalties if the orphan share
account does not contain sufficient money to reimburse claims, and interest may not accrue on outstanding
claims.
(4) Except as provided in subsections (6) and (7), claims may not be submitted and remedial
action costs may not be reimbursed from the orphan share account until all remedial actions, except for
operation and maintenance, are completed at a facility.
(5) Except as provided in subsection (6), reimbursement from the orphan share account must be

share in proportion to the orphan share's allocated share, as follows:

defending the orphan share must be paid from the orphan share account in proportion to the share of liability
allocated to the orphan share.

department's costs incurred in defending the orphan share in proportion to each person's allocated share of
liability.
(b) A person who pays the orphan share's proportional share of costs has a claim against the
orphan share account and must be reimbursed as provided in subsection (3).
(c) A state agency that is liable for remedial action costs incurred has a claim against the orphan
share account and must be reimbursed as provided in subsection (3). The agency may submit a claim before or
after remedial action is complete. Reimbursement may not be made for attorney fees, legal costs, or operation
and maintenance costs. The agency may be reimbursed only after:
(i) its liability has been determined pursuant to 75-10-742 through 75-10-751 or by a court of
competent jurisdiction;
(ii) it has received a notice letter pursuant to 75-10-711; and
(iii) the department has approved the costs.
(7) (a) If the lead liable person under 75-10-746 presents evidence to the department that the
person cannot complete the remedial actions without partial reimbursement and that a delay in reimbursement
will cause undue financial hardship on the person, the department may allow the submission of claims and may
reimburse the claims prior to the completion of all remedial actions. A person is not eligible for early
reimbursement unless the person is in substantial compliance with all department-approved remedial action
plans.
(b) The department may reimburse claims from a lead liable person upon completion and
department approval of a report evaluating the nature and extent of contamination and a report formulating and
evaluating final remediation alternatives. This early reimbursement is limited to those eligible costs incurred by
the lead liable person for the preparation of the reports.
(8) A person participating in the allocation process who received funds under the mixed funding
pilot program provided for in sections 14 through 20, Chapter 584, Laws of 1995, may not claim or receive
reimbursement from the orphan share account for the amount of funds received under the mixed funding pilot
program that are later attributed to the orphan share under the allocation process.

purposes, the remaining funds must be spent for remediation of the facility complex. The department may not
seek recovery of the $1.25 million from potentially liable persons.

the state agency in a judgment or settlement agreement for payment of the remedial action costs at the facility
for which the money was spent.

investments makes the certification pursuant to subsection (10)(b) of this section.
(b) (i) The board of investments shall monitor the long-term or perpetual water treatment
permanent trust fund provided for in 82-4-367 to determine when the amount of money in the long-term or
perpetual water treatment permanent trust fund will be sufficient, with future earnings, to provide a fund balance
of $19.3 million on January 1, 2018.
(ii) When the board of investments makes the determination pursuant to subsection (10)(b)(i), the
board of investments shall notify the department and certify to the department the amount of money, if any, that
must be transferred during the fiscal year in which the board of investments makes its determination pursuant
to subsection (10)(b)(i) in order to provide a fund balance of $19.3 million on January 1, 2018.

health, safety, or welfare or to the environment and there is no readily apparent person who is financially viable
and potentially liable under 75-10-715 to conduct the remedial action; or
(b) fund the administration of data collection, the monitoring of the performance of remedial action,
and the initial assessment of a facility to determine whether that facility may be closed or delisted.

beginning July 1, 2015, and ending June 30, 2025. For the bienniums beginning July 1, 2025, no more than
15% of the funds appropriated from the orphan share account may be used for data collection, initial

action costs may not be reimbursed from the orphan share account until all remedial actions, except for
operation and maintenance, are completed at a facility.
(5) Except as provided in subsection (6), reimbursement from the orphan share account must be
limited to actual documented remedial action costs incurred after the date of a petition provided for in 75-10-

69th Legislature 2025 HB 58
allocation under 75-10-742 through 75-10-751 shall pay all the orphan share's allocated share of the

after remedial action is complete. Reimbursement may not be made for attorney fees, legal costs, or operation

competent jurisdiction;
(ii) it has received a notice letter pursuant to 75-10-711; and
(iii) the department has approved the costs.

reimburse the claims prior to the completion of all remedial actions. A person is not eligible for early
reimbursement unless the person is in substantial compliance with all department-approved remedial action
plans.
(b) The department may reimburse claims from a lead liable person upon completion and
department approval of a report evaluating the nature and extent of contamination and a report formulating and
evaluating final remediation alternatives. This early reimbursement is limited to those eligible costs incurred by

(8) A person participating in the allocation process who received funds under the mixed funding
pilot program provided for in sections 14 through 20, Chapter 584, Laws of 1995, may not claim or receive
reimbursement from the orphan share account for the amount of funds received under the mixed funding pilot
program that are later attributed to the orphan share under the allocation process.

seek recovery of the $1.25 million from potentially liable persons.

the state agency in a judgment or settlement agreement for payment of the remedial action costs at the facility
for which the money was spent.

(b) (i) The board of investments shall monitor the long-term or perpetual water treatment
permanent trust fund provided for in 82-4-367 to determine when the amount of money in the long-term or
perpetual water treatment permanent trust fund will be sufficient, with future earnings, to provide a fund balance
of $19.3 million on January 1, 2018.
(ii) When the board of investments makes the determination pursuant to subsection (10)(b)(i), the
board of investments shall notify the department and certify to the department the amount of money, if any, that
must be transferred during the fiscal year in which the board of investments makes its determination pursuant
to subsection (10)(b)(i) in order to provide a fund balance of $19.3 million on January 1, 2018.
