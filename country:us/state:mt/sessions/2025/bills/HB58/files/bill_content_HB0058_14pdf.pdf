5 (b) A person who pays the orphan share's proportional share of costs has a claim against the
6 orphan share account and must be reimbursed as provided in subsection (3).
7 (c) A state agency that is liable for remedial action costs incurred has a claim against the orphan
8 share account and must be reimbursed as provided in subsection (3). The agency may submit a claim before or
9 after remedial action is complete. Reimbursement may not be made for attorney fees, legal costs, or operation

12 competent jurisdiction;
13 (ii) it has received a notice letter pursuant to 75-10-711; and

15 (7) (a) If the lead liable person under 75-10-746 presents evidence to the department that the
16 person cannot complete the remedial actions without partial reimbursement and that a delay in reimbursement
17 will cause undue financial hardship on the person, the department may allow the submission of claims and may
18 reimburse the claims prior to the completion of all remedial actions. A person is not eligible for early
19 reimbursement unless the person is in substantial compliance with all department-approved remedial action
20 plans.
21 (b) The department may reimburse claims from a lead liable person upon completion and
22 department approval of a report evaluating the nature and extent of contamination and a report formulating and
23 evaluating final remediation alternatives. This early reimbursement is limited to those eligible costs incurred by
24 the lead liable person for the preparation of the reports.
25 (8) A person participating in the allocation process who received funds under the mixed funding
26 pilot program provided for in sections 14 through 20, Chapter 584, Laws of 1995, may not claim or receive
27 reimbursement from the orphan share account for the amount of funds received under the mixed funding pilot
