right, privilege, and responsibility to cast votes on all questions or other matters brought to a vote;

place for any speech or debate in the Legislature that happens by participating remotely, as guaranteed by

member physically participating during the session; and

posted legal review note to include a statement from the primary sponsor that the adopted amendment has
resolved the potential legal issues cited in the legal review note.

provisions of a general appropriation act that does not directly and substantively address the subject of the bill.

meeting, and an audio recording log of the meeting must be kept. Committees are encouraged to provide at

to be available for legislative appropriation.
(b) The committee may prepare for introduction during a special session of the Legislature in which a

preparation of a fiscal note in anticipation of a subsequent formal request. A bill with financial implications for a
local government or school district must comply with subsection (4).

the request, based upon a written statement from the Budget Director that additional time is necessary to
properly prepare the note.

service or facility that requires the direct expenditure of additional funds without a specific means to finance the
activity, service, or facility in violation of section 1-2-112 or 1-2-113, MCA, must be accompanied, at the time

days of the request by the presiding officer; otherwise the bill may proceed without the updated fiscal note.
(10) The Budget Director shall make available on request to any member of the Legislature all
background information used in developing a fiscal note.

Fiscal Division, which shall prepare a fiscal note for the bill.

shall post the completed sponsors' fiscal note rebuttals online and may also print the completed sponsors' fiscal
note rebuttal forms on a different color paper than the fiscal notes prepared by the Budget Director.
40-120. Substitute bills. (1) A committee may recommend that every clause in a bill be changed and
that entirely new material be substituted so long as the new material is relevant to the title and subject of the
original bill. The substitute bill is considered an amendment and not a new bill.
(2) The proper form of reporting a substitute bill by a committee is to propose amendments to strike out
all of the material following the enacting clause, to substitute the new material, and to recommend any
necessary changes in the title of the bill.
(3) If a committee report is adopted that recommends a substitute for a bill originating in the other
house, the substitute bill must be printed and reproduced.
40-130. Reading of bills. Prior to passage, a bill, other than a bill requested by a joint select or joint
special committee as provided in 40-40(5)(b), must be read three times in the house in which it is under
consideration. It may be read either by title or by summary of title. Introduction constitutes the first reading of
the bill.
40-140. Second reading -- bill reproduction. (1) If the majority of a house adopts a recommendation
for the passage of a bill originating in that house after the bill has been returned from a committee with
amendments, the bill and its version status must be posted online and, if printed, the bill must be reproduced on
yellow paper with all amendments incorporated into the copies.
(2) If a bill has been returned from a committee without amendments, an indication must be made
online on the bill status page. If the bill is printed, only the first sheet must be reproduced on yellow paper, and

(3) A bill requested by and heard by a joint select or joint special committee, as provided in 40-40(5)(b),
may be referred directly to second reading. If the bill is passed by the house of origin, the bill must be
transmitted to the other house, and if the bill was not amended, it may be placed on second reading without the
need for referral to a committee.

house in which it originated and the report has been adopted, the bill must be engrossed if the bill is amended.

must be sent to printing. The bill must be placed on the agenda for third reading on the legislative day after
receipt.
(2) Copies of the engrossed bill must be available to members electronically. If also printed, the
engrossed bill must be reproduced on blue paper. If a bill is unamended by the Committee of the Whole and
contains no clerical errors, it is not required to be reprinted. If printed, only the first sheet must be reproduced
on blue paper, with the remainder of the text incorporated by reference to the preceding version of the entire
bill.
(3) If a bill is amended by a standing committee in the second house, the amendments must be
engrossed and the engrossed bill posted online. If the engrossed bill is also printed, the amendments must be
included in a tan-colored bill and distributed in the second house for second reading consideration. If the bill is
amended in Committee of the Whole, the amendments must be engrossed and the engrossed bill posted
online. If the engrossed bill is also printed, the amendments must be included in a salmon-colored reference bill
and distributed in the second house for third reading. If the bill passes on third reading, the reference bill must
be posted online and, if printed, copies distributed in the original house. The original house may request from
the second house a specified number of copies of the amendments to be printed.
40-160. Enrolling. (1) When a bill has passed both houses, it must be enrolled. An original and one
duplicate printed copy of the bill must be enrolled, free from all errors, with a margin of two inches at the top

(3) The correctly enrolled bill must be delivered to the presiding officer of the house in which the bill
- 25 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1
ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1

day after it has been reported correctly enrolled, unless the bill is delivered on the last legislative day, in which
case the presiding officer shall sign it that day. The fact of signing must be announced by the presiding officer
and entered upon the journal no later than the next legislative day. At any time after the report of a bill correctly
enrolled and before the signing, if a member signifies a desire to examine the bill, the member must be
permitted to do so. The bill then must be transmitted to the other house where the same procedure must be
followed.

40-170. Amendment by second house. (1) Amendments to a bill by the second house may not be
further amended by the house in which the bill originated, but must be either accepted or rejected. A bill
amended by the second house when the effect of the combined amendments is to return the bill to the form that
the bill passed the house in which the bill originated is not considered to have been amended and need not be
returned to the house of origin for acceptance or rejection of the amendments. If the amendments are rejected,
a conference committee may be requested by the house in which the bill originated. If the amendments are
accepted and the bill is of a type requiring more than a majority vote for passage, the bill again must be placed
on third reading in the house of origin.
(2) The vote on third reading after concurrence in amendments is the vote of the house of origin that

(Montana Constitution, Art. VI, Sec. 10).
(6) The Governor may veto items in appropriation bills, and in these instances the procedure must be
the same as upon veto of an entire bill (Montana Constitution, Art. VI, Sec. 10).

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1
A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
MONTANA ADOPTING THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE RULES.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the following Joint Rules be adopted:
JOINT RULES OF THE MONTANA
SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
CHAPTER 1
Legislator Remote Participation
1-05. Definitions. As used in these joint rules, the following definitions apply:
(1) "Member" means a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives for the 68th Legislature.
(2) "Participating remotely", "remotely present", or "participate remotely" means participating by
telephone, teleconference, videoconference, or other means.
(3) "Present" means a member was either physically present and participating in the session or
remotely present and participating in the session.
1-40. Members physically present or remotely present by electronic means. (1) The Senate and
the House may assemble, convene, and conduct the session with members being either physically present or
participating remotely. A member is not permitted to participate remotely unless excluded from physical
participation based on a decision of the member's caucus leader pursuant to Joint Rule 1-50.
(2) Subject to subsection (3), members who are permitted to participate remotely in the session:
(a) may vote on any question or other matter before the Senate or the House, including committees of
the Senate or the House;
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1
ENROLLED BILL

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1
(b) have the same privileges, rights, and duties as if the member were physically present, including the
right, privilege, and responsibility to cast votes on all questions or other matters brought to a vote;
(c) are considered to have immunity that prevents the member from being questioned in any other
place for any speech or debate in the Legislature that happens by participating remotely, as guaranteed by
Article V, section 8, of the Montana Constitution;
(d) are entitled to receive compensation for remotely participating in the same manner as a legislator
member physically participating during the session; and
(e) are considered present and in attendance at the session for all purposes, including for purposes of:
(i) determining a quorum pursuant to Article V, section 10, of the Montana Constitution; and
(ii) being present for the passage of a bill pursuant to Article V, section 11, of the Montana Constitution.

Rule 1-40 and to vote by proxy, except as provided in subsection (2).
(2) Voting by proxy in third reading may be authorized by a member's caucus leader only when a
member is hospitalized. Proxy voting on third reading is discouraged unless a member is physically present and

amendment. The form must be filed in the office of the amendments coordinator. A party receiving notice may
register an objection to the correction by filing the objection in writing with the Secretary of the Senate or the
Chief Clerk of the House by the end of the next legislative day following receipt of the notice. The Senate or

- 5 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1
ENROLLED BILL

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1
Senate or the Chief Clerk of the House shall notify the Executive Director of the Legislative Services Division,
and the engrossing staff shall change the bill to remove the correction or corrections to which the objection was

amended in a bill must be stated in the title.

referendum title would cause the title to cumulatively exceed 100 words, the title must include those sections
that do not exceed the 100-word limit and include a reference to the total number of additional sections listed in

members.

ENROLLED BILL

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1
(b) After a legal review note has been posted for an introduced bill, if the bill is later amended and the
primary sponsor of the bill believes the amendment resolves the potential legal issues cited in the legal review
note, the primary sponsor may request that the Legislative Services Division Legal Services Office revise the
posted legal review note to include a statement from the primary sponsor that the adopted amendment has
resolved the potential legal issues cited in the legal review note.
(7) Prior to submitting legislation for introduction, the chief sponsor may add representatives and
senators as cosponsors. A legislator may be added as a cosponsor by an in-person request, an electronic

sign or initial a cosponsor form supplied upon request by the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief Clerk of the
House in order to be added as a cosponsor. A legislator may also sign on the front page of the legislation.

a cosponsor form with the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief Clerk of the House.

10-140. Voting on bills -- constitutional amendments. (1) A bill may not become a law except by
vote of the constitutionally required majority of all the members present and voting in each house (Montana

those voting entered on the journal (Montana Constitution, Art. V, Sec. 11(2)).
(2) Any vote in one house on a bill proposing an amendment to The Constitution of the State of
Montana under circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-
thirds vote of the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote.
(3) This rule does not prevent a committee from tabling a bill proposing an amendment to The
Constitution of the State of Montana.
10-150. Recording and publication of voting. (1) Every vote of each member on each substantive
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1
ENROLLED BILL

(a) the date, time, and place of the meeting;
(b) a list of the individual members of the public body, agency, or organization who were in attendance;
(c) all matters proposed, discussed, or decided; and
(d) at the request of any member, a record of votes by individual members for any votes taken.

house and having the receiving house vote favorably on the request. The receiving house shall inform the
requesting house of its consent or lack of consent. Consent is not required on or after the 87th legislative day.
CHAPTER 30

chair of the Senate committee is the chair of all joint committees.
30-20. Voting in joint committees -- exception. (1) Except for Rules Committees and conference
committees, a member of a joint committee votes individually and not by the house to which the committee

conference committee and appoints a committee for the purpose of discussing an amendment on which the two

houses cannot agree, the other house shall appoint a committee for the same purpose.
(ii) (A) For Senate legislation, the President shall appoint the primary sponsor to the applicable
requested conference committee.
(B) For House legislation, the Speaker shall appoint the primary sponsor to the applicable requested
conference committee.
(b) Subject to subsection (4), the time and place of all conference committee meetings must be agreed
upon by their chairs and announced from the rostrum. This announcement is in order at any time. Failure to
make this announcement does not affect the validity of the legislation being considered.
(2) A conference committee, having conferred, shall report to the respective houses the result of its
conference. Subject to subsection (4), a conference committee shall confine itself to consideration of the
disputed amendment. The committee may recommend:
(a) acceptance or rejection of each disputed amendment in its entirety; or
(b) further amendment of the disputed amendment.
(3) (a) If either house requests a free conference committee and the other house concurs,
appointments must be made in the same manner as provided in subsection (1). Subject to subsection (4), a
free conference committee may discuss and propose amendments to a bill in its entirety and is not confined to
a particular amendment. However, a free conference committee is limited to consideration of amendments that
are within the scope of the title of the introduced bill.
(b) A free conference committee may not take executive action on an amendment to a bill implementing
provisions of a general appropriation act that does not directly and substantively address the subject of the bill.
(4) A meeting of a conference committee or free conference committee must be conducted as an open
meeting, and an audio recording log of the meeting must be kept. Committees are encouraged to provide at
least 24 hours' notice to members of the committee and the public. A committee shall conduct a hearing with
the opportunity for public comment for the purpose of commenting on proposed amendments or potential
amendments to the bill.
30-40. Conference committee -- enrolling. A conference committee report must give clerical
instructions for a corrected reference bill and for enrolling by referring to the reference bill version.

Committee must be held upon call of the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, who is chair of the joint
committee.
(3) The committee chair of the Senate Finance and Claims Committee or of the House Appropriations
Committee may be a voting member in the joint subcommittees if:
(a) either house has fewer members on the joint subcommittees;
(b) the chair represents the house with fewer members on the subcommittees; and
(c) the chair is present for the vote at the time that a question is called. A vote may not be held open to
facilitate voting by a chair.

resolution for the purpose of estimating revenue that may be available for appropriation by the Legislature.
(2) (a) The committee must have prepared by December 1 for introduction during each regular session
of the Legislature in which a revenue bill is under consideration an estimate of the amount of revenue projected
to be available for legislative appropriation.
(b) The committee may prepare for introduction during a special session of the Legislature in which a
revenue bill or an appropriation bill is under consideration an estimate of the amount of projected revenue. The

days of the request by the presiding officer; otherwise the bill may proceed without the updated fiscal note.
(10) The Budget Director shall make available on request to any member of the Legislature all
background information used in developing a fiscal note.

40-120. Substitute bills. (1) A committee may recommend that every clause in a bill be changed and
that entirely new material be substituted so long as the new material is relevant to the title and subject of the
original bill. The substitute bill is considered an amendment and not a new bill.

all of the material following the enacting clause, to substitute the new material, and to recommend any
necessary changes in the title of the bill.

house, the substitute bill must be printed and reproduced.

for the passage of a bill originating in that house after the bill has been returned from a committee with
amendments, the bill and its version status must be posted online and, if printed, the bill must be reproduced on
yellow paper with all amendments incorporated into the copies.

must be sent to printing. The bill must be placed on the agenda for third reading on the legislative day after
receipt.
(2) Copies of the engrossed bill must be available to members electronically. If also printed, the
engrossed bill must be reproduced on blue paper. If a bill is unamended by the Committee of the Whole and

on blue paper, with the remainder of the text incorporated by reference to the preceding version of the entire
bill.

further amended by the house in which the bill originated, but must be either accepted or rejected. A bill
amended by the second house when the effect of the combined amendments is to return the bill to the form that
the bill passed the house in which the bill originated is not considered to have been amended and need not be
returned to the house of origin for acceptance or rejection of the amendments. If the amendments are rejected,
a conference committee may be requested by the house in which the bill originated. If the amendments are
accepted and the bill is of a type requiring more than a majority vote for passage, the bill again must be placed

(6) The Governor may veto items in appropriation bills, and in these instances the procedure must be
the same as upon veto of an entire bill (Montana Constitution, Art. VI, Sec. 10).
(7) For the purposes of this rule and 40-220, receipt of the bill with a veto message from the Governor
by the house from which the bill originated occurs when either the Chief Clerk of the House or the Secretary of
the Senate physically receives the returned bill and the bill is time stamped and dated as being received.
40-220. Response to Governor's veto. (1) When the presiding officer receives a veto message, the
presiding officer shall read it to the members over the rostrum. After the reading, a member may move that the
Governor's veto be overridden.
(2) A vote on the motion is determined by roll call. If two-thirds of the members present vote "aye", the
veto is overridden. If two-thirds of the members present do not vote "aye", the veto is sustained.
40-230. Governor's recommendations for amendment -- procedure. (1) The Governor may return
any bill to the Legislature with recommendations for amendment. The Governor's recommendations for
amendment must be considered first by the house in which the bill originated.
(2) If the Legislature passes the bill in accordance with the Governor's recommendations, it shall return
the bill to the Governor for reconsideration. The Governor may not return a bill to the Legislature a second time
for amendment.
(3) If the Governor returns a bill to the originating house with recommendations for amendment, the
house shall reconsider the bill under its rules relating to amendments offered in Committee of the Whole.
(4) The bill then is subject to the following procedures:
(a) The originating house shall transmit to the second house, for consideration under its rules relating to
amendments in Committee of the Whole, the bill and the originating house's approval or disapproval of the
Governor's recommendations.
(b) If both houses approve the Governor's recommendations, the bill must be returned to the Governor
for reconsideration.
(c) If both houses disapprove the Governor's recommendations, the bill must be returned to the
Governor for reconsideration.
