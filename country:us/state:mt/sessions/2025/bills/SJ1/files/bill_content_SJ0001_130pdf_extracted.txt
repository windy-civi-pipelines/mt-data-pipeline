25 (2) Subject to subsection (3), members who are permitted to participate remotely in the session:
26 (a) may vote on any question or other matter before the Senate or the House, including committees of
27 the Senate or the House;
28 (b) have the same privileges, rights, and duties as if the member were physically present, including the
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1
69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1.1
1 right, privilege, and responsibility to cast votes on all questions or other matters brought to a vote;
2 (c) are considered to have immunity that prevents the member from being questioned in any other
3 place for any speech or debate in the Legislature that happens by participating remotely, as guaranteed by
4 Article V, section 8, of the Montana Constitution;
5 (d) are entitled to receive compensation for remotely participating in the same manner as a legislator
6 member physically participating during the session; and
7 (e) are considered present and in attendance at the session for all purposes, including for purposes of:
8 (i) determining a quorum pursuant to Article V, section 10, of the Montana Constitution; and
9 (ii) being present for the passage of a bill pursuant to Article V, section 11, of the Montana Constitution.

15 amended in a bill must be stated in the title.
16 (b) (i) Sections of the Montana Code Annotated repealed or amended in a legislative referendum must

18 exceed a 100-word limit.
19 (ii) If the inclusion of sections of the Montana Code Annotated repealed or amended in a legislative
20 referendum title would cause the title to cumulatively exceed 100 words, the title must include those sections
21 that do not exceed the 100-word limit and include a reference to the total number of additional sections listed in
22 the body of the bill that are excluded from the title due to the 100-word limit. Those additional sections excluded

- 6 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1

5 (7) Prior to submitting legislation for introduction, the chief sponsor may add representatives and
6 senators as cosponsors. A legislator may be added as a cosponsor by an in-person request, an electronic
7 message, a phone communication, or a cosponsor form. If a printed cosponsor form is used, a legislator must
8 sign or initial a cosponsor form supplied upon request by the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief Clerk of the
9 House in order to be added as a cosponsor. A legislator may also sign on the front page of the legislation.
10 (8) (a) Within 2 days from the date that the chief sponsor signs and accepts legislation from the
11 Legislative Services Division and prior to submitting legislation to the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief Clerk

21 those voting entered on the journal (Montana Constitution, Art. V, Sec. 11(2)).
22 (2) Any vote in one house on a bill proposing an amendment to The Constitution of the State of
23 Montana under circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-
24 thirds vote of the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote.

26 Constitution of the State of Montana.

13 spread upon the journal must be entered in the audio recording log of the appropriate committee or of the
14 appropriate house (Montana Constitution, Art. V, Sec. 11(2)). The official record of a committee meeting is the
15 audio recording of the meeting, and an audio recording log must also be kept that includes but is not limited to:
16 (a) the date, time, and place of the meeting;
17 (b) a list of the individual members of the public body, agency, or organization who were in attendance;

21 committees, a member of a joint committee votes individually and not by the house to which the committee

25 committee shall agree before any action may be taken, unless otherwise specified by individual house rules.
26 30-30. Conference committees -- subject matter restrictions. (1) (a) (i) If either house requests a
27 conference committee and appoints a committee for the purpose of discussing an amendment on which the two

4 conference committee.
5 (b) Subject to subsection (4), the time and place of all conference committee meetings must be agreed
6 upon by their chairs and announced from the rostrum. This announcement is in order at any time. Failure to
7 make this announcement does not affect the validity of the legislation being considered.
8 (2) A conference committee, having conferred, shall report to the respective houses the result of its
9 conference. Subject to subsection (4), a conference committee shall confine itself to consideration of the
10 disputed amendment. The committee may recommend:
11 (a) acceptance or rejection of each disputed amendment in its entirety; or
12 (b) further amendment of the disputed amendment.
13 (3) (a) If either house requests a free conference committee and the other house concurs,
14 appointments must be made in the same manner as provided in subsection (1). Subject to subsection (4), a
15 free conference committee may discuss and propose amendments to a bill in its entirety and is not confined to
16 a particular amendment. However, a free conference committee is limited to consideration of amendments that
17 are within the scope of the title of the introduced bill.
18 (b) A free conference committee may not take executive action on an amendment to a bill implementing
19 provisions of a general appropriation act that does not directly and substantively address the subject of the bill.
20 (4) A meeting of a conference committee or free conference committee must be conducted as an open
21 meeting, and an audio recording log of the meeting must be kept. Committees are encouraged to provide at
22 least 24 hours' notice to members of the committee and the public. A committee shall conduct a hearing with
23 the opportunity for public comment for the purpose of commenting on proposed amendments or potential
24 amendments to the bill.
25 30-40. Conference committee -- enrolling. A conference committee report must give clerical
26 instructions for a corrected reference bill and for enrolling by referring to the reference bill version.
27 30-50. Committee consideration of general appropriation bills. (1) All general appropriation bills
28 must first be considered by a joint subcommittee composed of designated members of the Senate Finance and

2 (2) Joint meetings of the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Finance and Claims
3 Committee must be held upon call of the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, who is chair of the joint
4 committee.
5 (3) The committee chair of the Senate Finance and Claims Committee or of the House Appropriations
6 Committee may be a voting member in the joint subcommittees if:
7 (a) either house has fewer members on the joint subcommittees;
8 (b) the chair represents the house with fewer members on the subcommittees; and
9 (c) the chair is present for the vote at the time that a question is called. A vote may not be held open to
10 facilitate voting by a chair.
11 30-60. Estimation of revenue. (1) The Revenue Interim Committee shall introduce a House joint
12 resolution for the purpose of estimating revenue that may be available for appropriation by the Legislature.

1 technical or mechanical defects in the bill may be noted.
2 (8) (a) A fiscal note also may be requested, with the approval of the presiding officer, on a bill and on

5 (ii) a majority of the members of the house in which the bill is to be considered, at the time of second
6 reading; or
7 (iii) the chief sponsor.

25 the bill, the date prepared, the version of the fiscal note being rebutted, the reasons the sponsor disagrees with

10 that entirely new material be substituted so long as the new material is relevant to the title and subject of the
11 original bill. The substitute bill is considered an amendment and not a new bill.
12 (2) The proper form of reporting a substitute bill by a committee is to propose amendments to strike out
13 all of the material following the enacting clause, to substitute the new material, and to recommend any
14 necessary changes in the title of the bill.

18 special committee as provided in 40-40(5)(b), must be read three times in the house in which it is under
19 consideration. It may be read either by title or by summary of title. Introduction constitutes the first reading of
20 the bill.
21 40-140. Second reading -- bill reproduction. (1) If the majority of a house adopts a recommendation
22 for the passage of a bill originating in that house after the bill has been returned from a committee with

- 24 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1

12 on blue paper, with the remainder of the text incorporated by reference to the preceding version of the entire
13 bill.
14 (3) If a bill is amended by a standing committee in the second house, the amendments must be
15 engrossed and the engrossed bill posted online. If the engrossed bill is also printed, the amendments must be
16 included in a tan-colored bill and distributed in the second house for second reading consideration. If the bill is
17 amended in Committee of the Whole, the amendments must be engrossed and the engrossed bill posted
18 online. If the engrossed bill is also printed, the amendments must be included in a salmon-colored reference bill
19 and distributed in the second house for third reading. If the bill passes on third reading, the reference bill must
20 be posted online and, if printed, copies distributed in the original house. The original house may request from
21 the second house a specified number of copies of the amendments to be printed.
22 40-160. Enrolling. (1) When a bill has passed both houses, it must be enrolled. An original and one
23 duplicate printed copy of the bill must be enrolled, free from all errors, with a margin of two inches at the top

2 case the presiding officer shall sign it that day. The fact of signing must be announced by the presiding officer
3 and entered upon the journal no later than the next legislative day. At any time after the report of a bill correctly
4 enrolled and before the signing, if a member signifies a desire to examine the bill, the member must be
5 permitted to do so. The bill then must be transmitted to the other house where the same procedure must be
6 followed.

8 (a) enrolled;
9 (b) clerically corrected by the presiding officers, if necessary;
10 (c) signed by the presiding officers; and

20 further amended by the house in which the bill originated, but must be either accepted or rejected. A bill
21 amended by the second house when the effect of the combined amendments is to return the bill to the form that
22 the bill passed the house in which the bill originated is not considered to have been amended and need not be
23 returned to the house of origin for acceptance or rejection of the amendments. If the amendments are rejected,
24 a conference committee may be requested by the house in which the bill originated. If the amendments are
25 accepted and the bill is of a type requiring more than a majority vote for passage, the bill again must be placed
26 on third reading in the house of origin.
27 (2) The vote on third reading after concurrence in amendments is the vote of the house of origin that

9 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
10 That the following Joint Rules be adopted:
11 JOINT RULES OF THE MONTANA
12 SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
13 CHAPTER 1
14 Legislator Remote Participation
15 1-05. Definitions. As used in these joint rules, the following definitions apply:
16 (1) "Member" means a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives for the 68th Legislature.

18 telephone, teleconference, videoconference, or other means.
19 (3) "Present" means a member was either physically present and participating in the session or
20 remotely present and participating in the session.
21 1-40. Members physically present or remotely present by electronic means. (1) The Senate and
22 the House may assemble, convene, and conduct the session with members being either physically present or
23 participating remotely. A member is not permitted to participate remotely unless excluded from physical
24 participation based on a decision of the member's caucus leader pursuant to Joint Rule 1-50.
25 (2) Subject to subsection (3), members who are permitted to participate remotely in the session:
26 (a) may vote on any question or other matter before the Senate or the House, including committees of
27 the Senate or the House;
28 (b) have the same privileges, rights, and duties as if the member were physically present, including the
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1.1
1 right, privilege, and responsibility to cast votes on all questions or other matters brought to a vote;
2 (c) are considered to have immunity that prevents the member from being questioned in any other
3 place for any speech or debate in the Legislature that happens by participating remotely, as guaranteed by
4 Article V, section 8, of the Montana Constitution;
5 (d) are entitled to receive compensation for remotely participating in the same manner as a legislator
6 member physically participating during the session; and
7 (e) are considered present and in attendance at the session for all purposes, including for purposes of:
8 (i) determining a quorum pursuant to Article V, section 10, of the Montana Constitution; and
9 (ii) being present for the passage of a bill pursuant to Article V, section 11, of the Montana Constitution.
10 (3) Members who vote remotely are required to use electronic authentication as determined by the

20 Constitution, Art. V, Sec. 11(1)). On final passage, the vote must be taken by ayes and noes and the names of
21 those voting entered on the journal (Montana Constitution, Art. V, Sec. 11(2)).
22 (2) Any vote in one house on a bill proposing an amendment to The Constitution of the State of
23 Montana under circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-
24 thirds vote of the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote.

26 Constitution of the State of Montana.

13 spread upon the journal must be entered in the audio recording log of the appropriate committee or of the
14 appropriate house (Montana Constitution, Art. V, Sec. 11(2)). The official record of a committee meeting is the
15 audio recording of the meeting, and an audio recording log must also be kept that includes but is not limited to:
16 (a) the date, time, and place of the meeting;
17 (b) a list of the individual members of the public body, agency, or organization who were in attendance;
18 (c) all matters proposed, discussed, or decided; and

5 Constitution, the consent of the other house is required for adjournment or recess for more than 3 calendar
6 days. Consent for adjournment is obtained by having the house wishing to adjourn send a message to the other

8 requesting house of its consent or lack of consent. Consent is not required on or after the 87th legislative day.
9 CHAPTER 30

13 proponents, opponents, and informational witnesses must be allowed on every bill or resolution before a
14 standing or select committee.

21 committees, a member of a joint committee votes individually and not by the house to which the committee
22 member belongs.
23 (2) Because the Rules Committees and conference committees are joint meetings of separate
24 committees, in those committees the committees from each house vote separately. A majority of each
25 committee shall agree before any action may be taken, unless otherwise specified by individual house rules.
26 30-30. Conference committees -- subject matter restrictions. (1) (a) (i) If either house requests a
27 conference committee and appoints a committee for the purpose of discussing an amendment on which the two
28 houses cannot agree, the other house shall appoint a committee for the same purpose.

4 conference committee.
5 (b) Subject to subsection (4), the time and place of all conference committee meetings must be agreed

7 make this announcement does not affect the validity of the legislation being considered.
8 (2) A conference committee, having conferred, shall report to the respective houses the result of its
9 conference. Subject to subsection (4), a conference committee shall confine itself to consideration of the
10 disputed amendment. The committee may recommend:

12 (b) further amendment of the disputed amendment.
13 (3) (a) If either house requests a free conference committee and the other house concurs,
14 appointments must be made in the same manner as provided in subsection (1). Subject to subsection (4), a
15 free conference committee may discuss and propose amendments to a bill in its entirety and is not confined to
16 a particular amendment. However, a free conference committee is limited to consideration of amendments that
17 are within the scope of the title of the introduced bill.
18 (b) A free conference committee may not take executive action on an amendment to a bill implementing
19 provisions of a general appropriation act that does not directly and substantively address the subject of the bill.
20 (4) A meeting of a conference committee or free conference committee must be conducted as an open
21 meeting, and an audio recording log of the meeting must be kept. Committees are encouraged to provide at
22 least 24 hours' notice to members of the committee and the public. A committee shall conduct a hearing with
23 the opportunity for public comment for the purpose of commenting on proposed amendments or potential
24 amendments to the bill.
25 30-40. Conference committee -- enrolling. A conference committee report must give clerical
26 instructions for a corrected reference bill and for enrolling by referring to the reference bill version.

6 Committee may be a voting member in the joint subcommittees if:
7 (a) either house has fewer members on the joint subcommittees;
8 (b) the chair represents the house with fewer members on the subcommittees; and
9 (c) the chair is present for the vote at the time that a question is called. A vote may not be held open to
10 facilitate voting by a chair.
11 30-60. Estimation of revenue. (1) The Revenue Interim Committee shall introduce a House joint
12 resolution for the purpose of estimating revenue that may be available for appropriation by the Legislature.

14 of the Legislature in which a revenue bill is under consideration an estimate of the amount of revenue projected
15 to be available for legislative appropriation.
16 (b) The committee may prepare for introduction during a special session of the Legislature in which a
17 revenue bill or an appropriation bill is under consideration an estimate of the amount of projected revenue. The

3 the approval of the Rules Committee of the house in which the bill is offered for introduction or reception.
4 (2) A bill may be designated as identical to another bill only by the Rules Committee of the house in
5 which the bill is offered for introduction or reception.
6 (3) Failure to override a veto does not constitute final rejection.
7 40-80. Reproduction of full statute required. A statute may not be amended or its provisions
8 extended by reference to its title only, but the statute section that is amended or extended must be reproduced
9 or published at length.
10 40-90. Bills -- original purpose. A law may not be passed except by bill. A bill may not be so altered
11 or amended on its passage through either house as to change its original purpose (Montana Constitution, Art.
12 V, Sec. 11(1)).
13 40-95. Amendment processing. (1) Amendments to bills and resolutions are drafted by Legislative
14 Services Division staff.
15 (2) All amendments must be reviewed by the staff of the Legislative Services Division for proper format,

18 for second reading in the Committee of the Whole must be posted online.
19 40-100. Fiscal notes. (1) All bills reported out of a committee of the Legislature, including interim
20 committees, having a potential effect on the revenues, expenditures, or fiscal liability of the state, local
21 governments, or public schools, except appropriation measures carrying specific dollar amounts, must include a
22 fiscal note incorporating an estimate of the fiscal effect. The Legislative Services Division staff shall indicate at
23 the top of each bill prepared for introduction that a fiscal note may be necessary under this rule. Fiscal notes
24 must be requested by the presiding officer of either house, who, at the time of introduction or after adoption of
25 substantive amendments to an introduced bill, shall determine the need for the note, based on the Legislative
26 Services Division staff recommendation.
27 (2) The Legislative Services Division shall make available an electronic copy of any bill for which it has
28 been determined a fiscal note may be necessary to the Budget Director immediately after the bill has been
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1.1

2 preparation of a fiscal note in anticipation of a subsequent formal request. A bill with financial implications for a
3 local government or school district must comply with subsection (4).
4 (3) The Budget Director, in cooperation with the governmental entity or entities affected by the bill, is
5 responsible for the preparation of the fiscal note. Except as provided in subsection (4), the Budget Director shall
6 return the fiscal note within 6 days unless further time is granted by the presiding officer or committee making
7 the request, based upon a written statement from the Budget Director that additional time is necessary to
8 properly prepare the note.
9 (4) (a) A bill that may require a local government or school district to perform an activity or provide a
10 service or facility that requires the direct expenditure of additional funds without a specific means to finance the
11 activity, service, or facility in violation of section 1-2-112 or 1-2-113, MCA, must be accompanied, at the time
12 that the bill is presented for introduction, by an estimate of all direct and indirect fiscal impacts on the local
13 government or school district. The estimate of the fiscal impacts must be prepared by the Budget Director in
14 cooperation with a local government or school district affected by the bill.
15 (b) The Budget Director has 10 days to prepare the estimate. Upon completion of the estimate, the
16 Budget Director shall submit it to the presiding officer and the chief sponsor of the bill.
17 (5) A completed fiscal note must be submitted by the Budget Director to the presiding officer who
18 requested it. The presiding officer shall notify the bill's chief sponsor of the completed fiscal note and request
19 the chief sponsor's actual or electronic signature. The chief sponsor has 1 legislative day after delivery to
20 review the fiscal note and to discuss the findings with the Budget Director, if necessary. After the legislative day
21 has elapsed, all fiscal notes having a potential effect on the revenues, expenditures, or fiscal liability must be
22 reproduced for the members of the committee hearing the bill and, if the bill is reported out of committee,
23 placed on the members' desks, either with or without the chief sponsor's actual or electronic signature.
24 (6) A fiscal note must, if possible, show in dollar amounts:
25 (a) the estimated increase or decrease in revenues or expenditures;
26 (b) costs that may be absorbed without additional funds; and

28 (7) The fiscal note may not include any comment or opinion relative to merits of the bill. However,
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1.1
1 technical or mechanical defects in the bill may be noted.
2 (8) (a) A fiscal note also may be requested, with the approval of the presiding officer, on a bill and on
3 an amended bill by:
4 (i) a committee considering the bill;
5 (ii) a majority of the members of the house in which the bill is to be considered, at the time of second
6 reading; or
7 (iii) the chief sponsor.
8 (b) With the approval of the presiding officer, a committee may request a revised fiscal note on
9 committee-approved amendments to a bill not reported out of committee by passing a motion to postpone
10 action on the bill pending a revised fiscal note.
11 (9) The Budget Director shall prepare and deliver an amended fiscal note on an amended bill within 3
12 days of the request by the presiding officer; otherwise the bill may proceed without the updated fiscal note.
13 (10) The Budget Director shall make available on request to any member of the Legislature all
14 background information used in developing a fiscal note.
15 (11) If a bill requires a fiscal note, the bill may not be reported from a committee for second reading
16 unless the bill is accompanied by the fiscal note.
17 (12) (a) If the budget director fails to prepare and submit a fiscal note in a timely fashion in accordance
18 with this rule, the presiding officer of each house may request the preparation of a fiscal note by the Legislative
19 Fiscal Division, which shall prepare a fiscal note for the bill.
20 (b) The presiding officer of the originating chamber shall designate which fiscal note accompanies the
21 bill or is used in the preparation of the status sheet if more than one fiscal note is prepared.
22 40-110. Sponsor's fiscal note rebuttal. (1) If a sponsor elects to prepare a sponsor's fiscal note
23 rebuttal, the sponsor shall make the election as provided and return the completed sponsor's fiscal note rebuttal
24 form to the presiding officer within 4 days of the election. The form must identify the bill number, the sponsor of
25 the bill, the date prepared, the version of the fiscal note being rebutted, the reasons the sponsor disagrees with
26 the fiscal note, the items or assumptions in the fiscal note that the sponsor believes are incorrect, and the
27 sponsor's estimate of the fiscal impact, if an estimate is available.
28 (2) The presiding officer may grant additional time to the sponsor for preparation of the sponsor's fiscal
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1.1
1 note rebuttal.
2 (3) Upon receipt of the completed sponsor's fiscal note rebuttal form, the presiding officer shall refer it
3 to the committee hearing the bill. If the bill is printed, the form must be identified as a sponsor's fiscal note
4 rebuttal, reproduced, and placed on the members' desks. The sponsor's fiscal note rebuttal must be posted
5 online with the bill materials.
6 (4) The House and the Senate shall provide forms for preparation of sponsors' fiscal note rebuttals and
7 shall post the completed sponsors' fiscal note rebuttals online and may also print the completed sponsors' fiscal
8 note rebuttal forms on a different color paper than the fiscal notes prepared by the Budget Director.
9 40-120. Substitute bills. (1) A committee may recommend that every clause in a bill be changed and
10 that entirely new material be substituted so long as the new material is relevant to the title and subject of the
11 original bill. The substitute bill is considered an amendment and not a new bill.
12 (2) The proper form of reporting a substitute bill by a committee is to propose amendments to strike out
13 all of the material following the enacting clause, to substitute the new material, and to recommend any
14 necessary changes in the title of the bill.
15 (3) If a committee report is adopted that recommends a substitute for a bill originating in the other
16 house, the substitute bill must be printed and reproduced.
17 40-130. Reading of bills. Prior to passage, a bill, other than a bill requested by a joint select or joint
18 special committee as provided in 40-40(5)(b), must be read three times in the house in which it is under
19 consideration. It may be read either by title or by summary of title. Introduction constitutes the first reading of
20 the bill.
21 40-140. Second reading -- bill reproduction. (1) If the majority of a house adopts a recommendation
22 for the passage of a bill originating in that house after the bill has been returned from a committee with
23 amendments, the bill and its version status must be posted online and, if printed, the bill must be reproduced on
24 yellow paper with all amendments incorporated into the copies.
25 (2) If a bill has been returned from a committee without amendments, an indication must be made
26 online on the bill status page. If the bill is printed, only the first sheet must be reproduced on yellow paper, and
27 the remainder of the text may be incorporated by reference to the preceding version of the entire bill.
28 (3) A bill requested by and heard by a joint select or joint special committee, as provided in 40-40(5)(b),
- 24 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1.1
1 may be referred directly to second reading. If the bill is passed by the house of origin, the bill must be
2 transmitted to the other house, and if the bill was not amended, it may be placed on second reading without the
3 need for referral to a committee.
4 40-150. Engrossing. (1) When a bill has been reported favorably by Committee of the Whole of the
5 house in which it originated and the report has been adopted, the bill must be engrossed if the bill is amended.

7 must be sent to printing. The bill must be placed on the agenda for third reading on the legislative day after
8 receipt.
9 (2) Copies of the engrossed bill must be available to members electronically. If also printed, the
10 engrossed bill must be reproduced on blue paper. If a bill is unamended by the Committee of the Whole and
11 contains no clerical errors, it is not required to be reprinted. If printed, only the first sheet must be reproduced
12 on blue paper, with the remainder of the text incorporated by reference to the preceding version of the entire
13 bill.
14 (3) If a bill is amended by a standing committee in the second house, the amendments must be
15 engrossed and the engrossed bill posted online. If the engrossed bill is also printed, the amendments must be
16 included in a tan-colored bill and distributed in the second house for second reading consideration. If the bill is
17 amended in Committee of the Whole, the amendments must be engrossed and the engrossed bill posted
18 online. If the engrossed bill is also printed, the amendments must be included in a salmon-colored reference bill
19 and distributed in the second house for third reading. If the bill passes on third reading, the reference bill must
20 be posted online and, if printed, copies distributed in the original house. The original house may request from
21 the second house a specified number of copies of the amendments to be printed.
22 40-160. Enrolling. (1) When a bill has passed both houses, it must be enrolled. An original and one
23 duplicate printed copy of the bill must be enrolled, free from all errors, with a margin of two inches at the top
24 and one inch on each side. In sections amending existing statutes, new matter must be underlined and deleted
25 matter must be shown as stricken. The enrolled bill must be posted online.
26 (2) When the enrolling is completed, the bill must be examined by the sponsor.
27 (3) The correctly enrolled bill must be delivered to the presiding officer of the house in which the bill
28 originated. The presiding officer shall sign the original and one copy of the bill not later than the next legislative
- 25 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1.1
1 day after it has been reported correctly enrolled, unless the bill is delivered on the last legislative day, in which
2 case the presiding officer shall sign it that day. The fact of signing must be announced by the presiding officer
3 and entered upon the journal no later than the next legislative day. At any time after the report of a bill correctly
4 enrolled and before the signing, if a member signifies a desire to examine the bill, the member must be
5 permitted to do so. The bill then must be transmitted to the other house where the same procedure must be
6 followed.
7 (4) A bill that has passed both houses of the Legislature by the 90th day may be:
8 (a) enrolled;
9 (b) clerically corrected by the presiding officers, if necessary;
10 (c) signed by the presiding officers; and
11 (d) delivered to the Governor or, in the case of a bill proposing a referendum, to the Secretary of State,
12 not later than 5 working days after the 90th legislative day.
13 (5) All journal entries authorized under this rule must be entered on the journal for the 90th day.
14 (6) The original and one copy signed by the presiding officer of each house must be presented to the

16 house of the day of the presentation, which must be entered on the journal.
17 (7) The original must be filed with the Secretary of State. A signed copy with a chapter number
18 assigned pursuant to section 5-11-204, MCA, must be filed with the Legislative Services Division.
19 40-170. Amendment by second house. (1) Amendments to a bill by the second house may not be
20 further amended by the house in which the bill originated, but must be either accepted or rejected. A bill
21 amended by the second house when the effect of the combined amendments is to return the bill to the form that
22 the bill passed the house in which the bill originated is not considered to have been amended and need not be
23 returned to the house of origin for acceptance or rejection of the amendments. If the amendments are rejected,
24 a conference committee may be requested by the house in which the bill originated. If the amendments are
25 accepted and the bill is of a type requiring more than a majority vote for passage, the bill again must be placed
26 on third reading in the house of origin.
27 (2) The vote on third reading after concurrence in amendments is the vote of the house of origin that
28 must be used to determine if the required number of votes has been cast.

23 (3) The Governor shall return a vetoed bill to the Legislature with a statement of reasons for the veto.

28 approved by two-thirds of the members present or it may be reconvened to reconsider any bill so vetoed
- 28 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 1

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 1.1

2 (6) The Governor may veto items in appropriation bills, and in these instances the procedure must be
3 the same as upon veto of an entire bill (Montana Constitution, Art. VI, Sec. 10).
4 (7) For the purposes of this rule and 40-220, receipt of the bill with a veto message from the Governor

19 house shall reconsider the bill under its rules relating to amendments offered in Committee of the Whole.
20 (4) The bill then is subject to the following procedures:
