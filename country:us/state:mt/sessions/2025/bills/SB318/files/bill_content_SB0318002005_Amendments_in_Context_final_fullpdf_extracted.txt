17 in 40-4-212 and subsection (1)(a):
18 (i) the feasibility of preserving the relationship between the nonrelocating parent and the child
19 through suitable visitation arrangements, considering the logistics and financial circumstances of the parties;

21 (iii) whether the parent seeking to change the child's residence has demonstrated a willingness to

13 filed after a parent returns from military service, the court may not consider a parent's absence due to that
14 military service in its determination of the best interest of the child.
15 (b) A parent who has performed or is performing military service, as defined in 10-1-1003, may

20 Section 8. Section 40-4-227, MCA, is amended to read:
21 "40-4-227. Rights of parents and children -- policy -- findings -- definitions. (1) It is the policy of
22 the state of Montana:
23 (a) to recognize the constitutionally protected rights of parents and the integrity of the family unit;
24 (b) to recognize a child's rights, including constitutionally protected rights, including rights:
25 (i) to be protected from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or
26 negligent treatment, exploitation, and sexual abuse while in the care of a parent, legal guardian, or other person
27 who has a duty to care for the child;
28 (ii) when the child is capable of forming the child's own views, to express those views freely in all

1 matters affecting the child and for the child's views to be given due weight in accordance with the child's age
2 and maturity;
3 (iii) to refuse a relationship with an unfit parent, sibling, or extended family member; and
4 (iv) to all fundamental rights unless those rights are specifically precluded by laws that enhance
5 their protection; and
6 (c) to ensure that the best interests of the child are met in parenting proceedings.
7 (2) The legislature finds:
8 (a) that while it is in the best interests of a child to maintain a relationship with a natural parent, a
9 natural parent's inchoate interest in the child requires constitutional protection only when the parent has
10 demonstrated a timely commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood; and
11 (b) that a parent's constitutionally protected interest in the parental control of a child should yield to
12 the best interests of the child when the parent's conduct is contrary to the child-parent relationship.
13 (3) In a child custody proceeding, a court may not, solely in order to improve a deficient
14 relationship with the other parent of a child, remove the child from or restrict contact between the child and a
15 parent or litigating party:
16 (a) who is competent, protective, and not physically or sexually abusive; and
17 (b) with whom the child is bonded or to whom the child is attached.
18 (4) In a child custody proceeding, a court may not order a reunification treatment unless:
19 (a) there is generally accepted and scientifically valid proof of the safety, effectiveness, and
20 therapeutic value of the reunification treatment; and
21 (b) the reunification treatment is not predicated on cutting off a child from a parent with whom the
22 child is bonded or to whom the child is attached.
23 (5) An order in a child custody proceeding to remediate the resistance of a child to have contact
24 with a violent or abusive parent must primarily address the behavior of that parent or the contributions of that

2 (x) sexual abuse of children, as described in 45-5-625; and
3 (xi) strangulation of a partner or family member, as described in 45-5-215.
4 (9) Except in cases of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or threat of physical, sexual, or
5 emotional abuse by one parent against the other parent or the child or when a parent has been convicted of a
6 crime enumerated in subsection (8)(b), the court may, in its discretion, order the parties to participate in a
7 dispute resolution process to assist in resolving any conflicts between the parties regarding amendment of the
8 parenting plan. The dispute resolution process may include counseling or mediation by a specified person or
9 agency, and court action.
10 (10) (a) Except as provided in subsection (10)(b), a court-ordered or de facto modification of a
11 parenting plan based in whole or in part on military service orders of a parent is temporary and reverts to the
12 previous parenting plan at the end of the military service. If a motion for an amendment of a parenting plan is
13 filed after a parent returns from military service, the court may not consider a parent's absence due to that
14 military service in its determination of the best interest of the child.
15 (b) A parent who has performed or is performing military service, as defined in 10-1-1003, may
16 consent to a temporary or permanent modification of a parenting plan:
17 (i) for the duration of the military service; or

20 Section 8. Section 40-4-227, MCA, is amended to read:
21 "40-4-227. Rights of parents and children -- policy -- findings -- definitions. (1) It is the policy of
22 the state of Montana:
23 (a) to recognize the constitutionally protected rights of parents and the integrity of the family unit;
24 (b) to recognize a child's rights, including constitutionally protected rights, including rights:
25 (i) to be protected from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or
26 negligent treatment, exploitation, and sexual abuse while in the care of a parent, legal guardian, or other person
27 who has a duty to care for the child;
28 (ii) when the child is capable of forming the child's own views, to express those views freely in all

1 matters affecting the child and for the child's views to be given due weight in accordance with the child's age
2 and maturity;
3 (iii) to refuse a relationship with an unfit parent, sibling, or extended family member; and
4 (iv) to all fundamental rights unless those rights are specifically precluded by laws that enhance
5 their protection; and
6 (c) to ensure that the best interests of the child are met in parenting proceedings.
7 (2) The legislature finds:
8 (a) that while it is in the best interests of a child to maintain a relationship with a natural parent, a
9 natural parent's inchoate interest in the child requires constitutional protection only when the parent has
10 demonstrated a timely commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood; and
11 (b) that a parent's constitutionally protected interest in the parental control of a child should yield to
12 the best interests of the child when the parent's conduct is contrary to the child-parent relationship.
13 (3) In a child custody proceeding, a court may not, solely in order to improve a deficient
14 relationship with the other parent of a child, remove the child from or restrict contact between the child and a
15 parent or litigating party:
16 (a) who is competent, protective, and not physically or sexually abusive; and
17 (b) with whom the child is bonded or to whom the child is attached.
18 (4) In a child custody proceeding, a court may not order a reunification treatment unless:
19 (a) there is generally accepted and scientifically valid proof of the safety, effectiveness, and
20 therapeutic value of the reunification treatment; and
21 (b) the reunification treatment is not predicated on cutting off a child from a parent with whom the
22 child is bonded or to whom the child is attached.
23 (5) An order in a child custody proceeding to remediate the resistance of a child to have contact
24 with a violent or abusive parent must primarily address the behavior of that parent or the contributions of that
25 parent to the resistance of the child before ordering the other parent of the child to take steps to potentially
26 improve the relationship of the child with the parent with whom the child resists contact.
27 (6) As used in this section, the following definitions apply:
28 (a) (i) "Child custody proceeding" means a dissolution, separation, visitation, paternity, support,

1 custody, or civil protection order proceeding between the parents of a child involving the care or custody of the
2 child.
3 (ii) The term does not include:
4 (A) a child protection, abuse, or neglect proceeding under Title 41, chapter 3;
5 (B) a juvenile justice proceeding under Title 41, chapter 5; or
6 (C) a child placement proceeding in which the state or a tribal government, a designee of the state
7 or tribal government, or a contractor of the state or tribal government is a party to the proceeding.
8 (b) "Reunification treatment" means a treatment or therapy aimed at reuniting or reestablishing a
9 relationship between a child and an estranged or rejected parent or other family member of the child."
