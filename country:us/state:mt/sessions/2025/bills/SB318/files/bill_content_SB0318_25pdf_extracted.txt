- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0318.2
1 unknown to the court at the time of entry of the prior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of
2 the child and that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.
3 (a) In determining how a proposed change will affect the child, the court shall consider the
4 potential impact of the change on the criteria in 40-4-212 and the fundamental rights of the child under 40-4-227
5 and whether:
6 (i) the parents agree to the amendment;
7 (ii) the child has been integrated into the family of the petitioner with consent of the parents;

14 (b) If one parent has changed or intends to change the child's residence in a manner that
15 significantly affects the child's contact with the other parent, the court shall consider, in addition to all the criteria
16 in 40-4-212 and subsection (1)(a):
17 (i) the feasibility of preserving the relationship between the nonrelocating parent and the child
18 through suitable visitation arrangements, considering the logistics and financial circumstances of the parties;
19 (ii) the reasons of each parent for seeking or opposing the change of residence;
20 (iii) whether the parent seeking to change the child's residence has demonstrated a willingness to
21 promote the relationship between the child and the nonrelocating parent; and
22 (iv) whether reasonable alternatives to the proposed change of residence are available to the
23 parent seeking to relocate.
24 (2) A court may modify a de facto parenting arrangement in accordance with the factors set forth in
25 40-4-212.
26 (3) The court shall presume a parent is not acting in the child's best interest if the parent does any

6 (7) As used in this section, "prior parenting plan" means a parenting determination contained in a
7 judicial decree or order made in a parenting proceeding. In proceedings for amendment under this section, a
8 proposed amended parenting plan must be filed and served with the motion for amendment and with the
9 response to the motion for amendment. Preference must be given to carrying out the parenting plan.
10 (8) (a) If a parent or other person residing in that parent's household has been convicted of any of
11 the crimes listed in subsection (8)(b), the other parent or any other person who has been granted rights to the
12 child pursuant to court order may file an objection to the current parenting order with the court. The parent or
13 other person having rights to the child pursuant to court order shall give notice to the other parent of the
14 objection as provided by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, and the other parent has 21 days from the
15 notice to respond. If the parent who receives notice of objection fails to respond within 21 days, the parenting
16 rights of that parent are suspended until further order of the court. If that parent responds and objects, a hearing
17 must be held within 30 days of the response.

5 crime enumerated in subsection (8)(b), the court may, in its discretion, order the parties to participate in a
6 dispute resolution process to assist in resolving any conflicts between the parties regarding amendment of the
7 parenting plan. The dispute resolution process may include counseling or mediation by a specified person or
8 agency, and court action.
9 (10) (a) Except as provided in subsection (10)(b), a court-ordered or de facto modification of a
10 parenting plan based in whole or in part on military service orders of a parent is temporary and reverts to the
11 previous parenting plan at the end of the military service. If a motion for an amendment of a parenting plan is
12 filed after a parent returns from military service, the court may not consider a parent's absence due to that
13 military service in its determination of the best interest of the child.
14 (b) A parent who has performed or is performing military service, as defined in 10-1-1003, may
15 consent to a temporary or permanent modification of a parenting plan:
16 (i) for the duration of the military service; or

19 Section 8. Section 40-4-227, MCA, is amended to read:
20 "40-4-227. Rights of parents and children -- policy -- findings -- definitions. (1) It is the policy of
21 the state of Montana:
22 (a) to recognize the constitutionally protected rights of parents and the integrity of the family unit;
23 (b) to recognize a child's rights, including constitutionally protected rights, including rights:
24 (i) to be protected from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or
25 negligent treatment, exploitation, and sexual abuse while in the care of a parent, legal guardian, or other person
26 who has a duty to care for the child;
27 (ii) when the child is capable of forming the child's own views, to express those views freely in all
28 matters affecting the child and for the child's views to be given due weight in accordance with the child's age
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – SB 318
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0318.2
1 and maturity;
2 (iii) to refuse a relationship with an unfit parent, sibling, or extended family member; and
3 (iv) to all fundamental rights unless those rights are specifically precluded by laws that enhance
4 their protection; and
5 (c) to ensure that the best interests of the child are met in parenting proceedings.
6 (2) The legislature finds:
7 (a) that while it is in the best interests of a child to maintain a relationship with a natural parent, a
8 natural parent's inchoate interest in the child requires constitutional protection only when the parent has
9 demonstrated a timely commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood; and
10 (b) that a parent's constitutionally protected interest in the parental control of a child should yield to
11 the best interests of the child when the parent's conduct is contrary to the child-parent relationship.
12 (3) In a child custody proceeding, a court may not, solely in order to improve a deficient
13 relationship with the other parent of a child, remove the child from or restrict contact between the child and a
14 parent or litigating party:
15 (a) who is competent, protective, and not physically or sexually abusive; and
16 (b) with whom the child is bonded or to whom the child is attached.
17 (4) In a child custody proceeding, a court may not order a reunification treatment unless:
18 (a) there is generally accepted and scientifically valid proof of the safety, effectiveness, and
19 therapeutic value of the reunification treatment; and
20 (b) the reunification treatment is not predicated on cutting off a child from a parent with whom the
21 child is bonded or to whom the child is attached.
22 (5) An order in a child custody proceeding to remediate the resistance of a child to have contact
23 with a violent or abusive parent must primarily address the behavior of that parent or the contributions of that
24 parent to the resistance of the child before ordering the other parent of the child to take steps to potentially
25 improve the relationship of the child with the parent with whom the child resists contact.
26 (6) As used in this section, the following definitions apply:
27 (a) (i) "Child custody proceeding" means a dissolution, separation, visitation, paternity, support,
28 custody, or civil protection order proceeding between the parents of a child involving the care or custody of the
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – SB 318
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0318.2
1 child.
2 (ii) The term does not include:
3 (A) a child protection, abuse, or neglect proceeding under Title 41, chapter 3;
4 (B) a juvenile justice proceeding under Title 41, chapter 5; or
5 (C) a child placement proceeding in which the state or a tribal government, a designee of the state
6 or tribal government, or a contractor of the state or tribal government is a party to the proceeding.
7 (b) "Reunification treatment" means a treatment or therapy aimed at reuniting or reestablishing a
8 relationship between a child and an estranged or rejected parent or other family member of the child."

1 unknown to the court at the time of entry of the prior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of
2 the child and that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child.
3 (a) In determining how a proposed change will affect the child, the court shall consider the
4 potential impact of the change on the criteria in 40-4-212 and the fundamental rights of the child under 40-4-227
5 and whether:
6 (i) the parents agree to the amendment;
7 (ii) the child has been integrated into the family of the petitioner with consent of the parents;
8 (iii) the child is 14 years of age or older and desires the amendment; or

13 (B) (C) attempted to frustrate or deny contact with the child by the other parent.
14 (b) If one parent has changed or intends to change the child's residence in a manner that
15 significantly affects the child's contact with the other parent, the court shall consider, in addition to all the criteria
16 in 40-4-212 and subsection (1)(a):
17 (i) the feasibility of preserving the relationship between the nonrelocating parent and the child
18 through suitable visitation arrangements, considering the logistics and financial circumstances of the parties;
19 (ii) the reasons of each parent for seeking or opposing the change of residence;
20 (iii) whether the parent seeking to change the child's residence has demonstrated a willingness to
21 promote the relationship between the child and the nonrelocating parent; and
22 (iv) whether reasonable alternatives to the proposed change of residence are available to the
23 parent seeking to relocate.
24 (2) A court may modify a de facto parenting arrangement in accordance with the factors set forth in
25 40-4-212.
26 (3) The court shall presume a parent is not acting in the child's best interest if the parent does any

4 amendment if the court finds that the amendment action is vexatious and constitutes harassment.
5 (6) A parenting plan may be amended pursuant to 40-4-221 upon the death of one parent.
6 (7) As used in this section, "prior parenting plan" means a parenting determination contained in a
7 judicial decree or order made in a parenting proceeding. In proceedings for amendment under this section, a
8 proposed amended parenting plan must be filed and served with the motion for amendment and with the
9 response to the motion for amendment. Preference must be given to carrying out the parenting plan.
10 (8) (a) If a parent or other person residing in that parent's household has been convicted of any of
11 the crimes listed in subsection (8)(b), the other parent or any other person who has been granted rights to the
12 child pursuant to court order may file an objection to the current parenting order with the court. The parent or
13 other person having rights to the child pursuant to court order shall give notice to the other parent of the
14 objection as provided by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, and the other parent has 21 days from the
15 notice to respond. If the parent who receives notice of objection fails to respond within 21 days, the parenting
16 rights of that parent are suspended until further order of the court. If that parent responds and objects, a hearing
17 must be held within 30 days of the response.
18 (b) This subsection (8) applies to the following crimes:

5 crime enumerated in subsection (8)(b), the court may, in its discretion, order the parties to participate in a
6 dispute resolution process to assist in resolving any conflicts between the parties regarding amendment of the
7 parenting plan. The dispute resolution process may include counseling or mediation by a specified person or
8 agency, and court action.
9 (10) (a) Except as provided in subsection (10)(b), a court-ordered or de facto modification of a
10 parenting plan based in whole or in part on military service orders of a parent is temporary and reverts to the
11 previous parenting plan at the end of the military service. If a motion for an amendment of a parenting plan is
12 filed after a parent returns from military service, the court may not consider a parent's absence due to that
13 military service in its determination of the best interest of the child.
14 (b) A parent who has performed or is performing military service, as defined in 10-1-1003, may
15 consent to a temporary or permanent modification of a parenting plan:
16 (i) for the duration of the military service; or

6 (2) The legislature finds:
7 (a) that while it is in the best interests of a child to maintain a relationship with a natural parent, a
8 natural parent's inchoate interest in the child requires constitutional protection only when the parent has
9 demonstrated a timely commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood; and
10 (b) that a parent's constitutionally protected interest in the parental control of a child should yield to
11 the best interests of the child when the parent's conduct is contrary to the child-parent relationship.
12 (3) In a child custody proceeding, a court may not, solely in order to improve a deficient
13 relationship with the other parent of a child, remove the child from or restrict contact between the child and a
14 parent or litigating party:
15 (a) who is competent, protective, and not physically or sexually abusive; and
16 (b) with whom the child is bonded or to whom the child is attached.
17 (4) In a child custody proceeding, a court may not order a reunification treatment unless:
18 (a) there is generally accepted and scientifically valid proof of the safety, effectiveness, and
19 therapeutic value of the reunification treatment; and
20 (b) the reunification treatment is not predicated on cutting off a child from a parent with whom the
21 child is bonded or to whom the child is attached.
22 (5) An order in a child custody proceeding to remediate the resistance of a child to have contact
23 with a violent or abusive parent must primarily address the behavior of that parent or the contributions of that
24 parent to the resistance of the child before ordering the other parent of the child to take steps to potentially
25 improve the relationship of the child with the parent with whom the child resists contact.
26 (6) As used in this section, the following definitions apply:
27 (a) (i) "Child custody proceeding" means a dissolution, separation, visitation, paternity, support,
28 custody, or civil protection order proceeding between the parents of a child involving the care or custody of the

4 (B) a juvenile justice proceeding under Title 41, chapter 5; or
5 (C) a child placement proceeding in which the state or a tribal government, a designee of the state
6 or tribal government, or a contractor of the state or tribal government is a party to the proceeding.
7 (b) "Reunification treatment" means a treatment or therapy aimed at reuniting or reestablishing a
8 relationship between a child and an estranged or rejected parent or other family member of the child."
