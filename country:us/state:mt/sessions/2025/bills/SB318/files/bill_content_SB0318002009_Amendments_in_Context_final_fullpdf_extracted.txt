23 (b) If one parent has changed or intends to change the child's residence in a manner that
24 significantly affects the child's contact with the other parent, the court shall consider, in addition to all the criteria
25 in 40-4-212 and subsection (1)(a):
26 (i) the feasibility of preserving the relationship between the nonrelocating parent and the child
27 through suitable visitation arrangements, considering the logistics and financial circumstances of the parties;

9 of the acts specified in subsection (1)(a)(iv) or (8).

11 residential schedule for parental contact with the child and to apportion transportation costs between the
12 parents.

14 amendment if the court finds that the amendment action is vexatious and constitutes harassment.
15 (6) A parenting plan may be amended pursuant to 40-4-221 upon the death of one parent.
16 (7) As used in this section, "prior parenting plan" means a parenting determination contained in a
17 judicial decree or order made in a parenting proceeding. In proceedings for amendment under this section, a
18 proposed amended parenting plan must be filed and served with the motion for amendment and with the
19 response to the motion for amendment. Preference must be given to carrying out the parenting plan.
20 (8) (a) If a parent or other person residing in that parent's household has been convicted of any of
21 the crimes listed in subsection (8)(b), the other parent or any other person who has been granted rights to the
22 child pursuant to court order may file an objection to the current parenting order with the court. The parent or
23 other person having rights to the child pursuant to court order shall give notice to the other parent of the
24 objection as provided by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, and the other parent has 21 days from the
25 notice to respond. If the parent who receives notice of objection fails to respond within 21 days, the parenting
26 rights of that parent are suspended until further order of the court. If that parent responds and objects, a hearing

3 Section 8. Section 40-4-227, MCA, is amended to read:
4 "40-4-227. Rights of parents and children -- policy -- findings -- definitions. (1) It is the policy of
5 the state of Montana:
6 (a) to recognize the constitutionally protected rights of parents and the integrity of the family unit;
7 (b) to recognize a child's rights, including constitutionally protected rights, including rights:
8 (i) to be protected from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or
9 negligent treatment, exploitation, and sexual abuse while in the care of a parent, legal guardian, or other person
10 who has a duty to care for the child;
11 (ii) when the child is capable of forming the child's own views, to express those views freely in all
12 matters affecting the child and for the child's views to be given due weight in accordance with the child's age
13 and maturity;
14 (iii) to refuse a relationship with an unfit parent, sibling, or extended family member; and
15 (iv) to all fundamental rights unless those rights are specifically precluded by laws that enhance
16 their protection; and
17 (c) to ensure that the best interests of the child are met in parenting proceedings.
18 (2) The legislature finds:
19 (a) that while it is in the best interests of a child to maintain a relationship with a natural parent, a
20 natural parent's inchoate interest in the child requires constitutional protection only when the parent has
21 demonstrated a timely commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood; and
22 (b) that a parent's constitutionally protected interest in the parental control of a child should yield to
23 the best interests of the child when the parent's conduct is contrary to the child-parent relationship.
24 (3) In a child custody proceeding, a court may not, solely in order to improve a deficient
25 relationship with the other parent of a child, remove the child from or restrict contact between the child and a
26 parent or litigating party:
27 (a) who is competent, protective, and not physically or sexually abusive; and

11 residential schedule for parental contact with the child and to apportion transportation costs between the

3 Section 8. Section 40-4-227, MCA, is amended to read:
4 "40-4-227. Rights of parents and children -- policy -- findings -- definitions. (1) It is the policy of
5 the state of Montana:
6 (a) to recognize the constitutionally protected rights of parents and the integrity of the family unit;
7 (b) to recognize a child's rights, including constitutionally protected rights, including rights:
8 (i) to be protected from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or
9 negligent treatment, exploitation, and sexual abuse while in the care of a parent, legal guardian, or other person
10 who has a duty to care for the child;
11 (ii) when the child is capable of forming the child's own views, to express those views freely in all
12 matters affecting the child and for the child's views to be given due weight in accordance with the child's age
13 and maturity;
14 (iii) to refuse a relationship with an unfit parent, sibling, or extended family member; and
15 (iv) to all fundamental rights unless those rights are specifically precluded by laws that enhance
16 their protection; and
17 (c) to ensure that the best interests of the child are met in parenting proceedings.
18 (2) The legislature finds:
19 (a) that while it is in the best interests of a child to maintain a relationship with a natural parent, a
20 natural parent's inchoate interest in the child requires constitutional protection only when the parent has
21 demonstrated a timely commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood; and
22 (b) that a parent's constitutionally protected interest in the parental control of a child should yield to
23 the best interests of the child when the parent's conduct is contrary to the child-parent relationship.
24 (3) In a child custody proceeding, a court may not, solely in order to improve a deficient
25 relationship with the other parent of a child, remove the child from or restrict contact between the child and a
26 parent or litigating party:
27 (a) who is competent, protective, and not physically or sexually abusive; and

1 (b) with whom the child is bonded or to whom the child is attached.
2 (4) In a child custody proceeding, a court may not order a reunification treatment unless:
3 (a) there is generally accepted and scientifically valid proof of the safety, effectiveness, and
4 therapeutic value of the reunification treatment; and
5 (b) the reunification treatment is not predicated on cutting off a child from a parent with whom the
6 child is bonded or to whom the child is attached.
7 (5) An order in a child custody proceeding to remediate the resistance of a child to have contact
8 with a violent or abusive parent must primarily address the behavior of that parent or the contributions of that
9 parent to the resistance of the child before ordering the other parent of the child to take steps to potentially
10 improve the relationship of the child with the parent with whom the child resists contact.
11 (6) As used in this section, the following definitions apply:
12 (a) (i) "Child custody proceeding" means a dissolution, separation, visitation, paternity, support,
13 custody, or civil protection order proceeding between the parents of a child involving the care or custody of the
14 child.
15 (ii) The term does not include:
16 (A) a child protection, abuse, or neglect proceeding under Title 41, chapter 3;
17 (B) a juvenile justice proceeding under Title 41, chapter 5; or
18 (C) a child placement proceeding in which the state or a tribal government, a designee of the state
19 or tribal government, or a contractor of the state or tribal government is a party to the proceeding.
20 (b) "Reunification treatment" means a treatment or therapy aimed at reuniting or reestablishing a
21 relationship between a child and an estranged or rejected parent or other family member of the child."
