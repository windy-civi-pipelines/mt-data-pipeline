69th Legislature 2025 HB 437.1
2 INTRODUCED BY E. STAFMAN
3
4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT PROVIDING FOR DISMISSAL OF A COMPLAINT,
5 INFORMATION, OR INDICTMENT AGAINST A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WHEN THE STATE FAILS TO
6 SHOW THAT THE CONDUCT ON WHICH THE COMPLAINT WAS BASED WAS KNOWINGLY AND
7 PURPOSELY COMMITTED AND THAT THE CONDUCT WAS OUTSIDE THE ACCEPTED STANDARDS OF
8 CARE FOR THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDER.”
9
10 WHEREAS, the eighth principle of the American Medical Association's Principles of Medical Ethics
11 states, "A physician shall, while caring for a patient, regard responsibility to the patient as paramount"; and
12 WHEREAS, on average, physicians spend 50.7 months of their 40-year careers with open or
13 unresolved court claims that add stress, work, reputational damage, and loss of time caring for patients to
14 physicians already overburdened with large patient loads, and many claims rest on the difference between
15 negligence and appropriate care; and
16 WHEREAS, practicing physicians are leaving states that have conflicts between state law and the
17 standard of care within specialties, such as obstetrics; and
18 WHEREAS, medical residents are choosing to receive their specialized medical training in states with
19 less restrictive laws related to the practice of medicine; and
20 WHEREAS, Montana competes against other states for the employment of medical professionals, and
21 the state faces a health care provider shortage; and
22 WHEREAS, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services designated 51 of 56
23 counties in 2022 as health professional shortage areas, and the March of Dimes stated that 50% of Montana
24 counties qualified as maternity care deserts in its 2023 report; and
25 WHEREAS, medical care is driven by the scientific method, which aims to continuously reexamine the
26 best course of treatment, and thus medical care, by definition, will change over time; and
27 WHEREAS, the standards of care provided to patients will change over time because a standard of
28 care is based on what a similarly qualified, reasonable medical professional would do in the same

1 circumstances in a similar timeframe; and
2 WHEREAS, those physicians who follow their medical judgment and the latest scientific evidence are
3 able to offer new therapeutic options with off-label use of medications when standard treatment regimens are
4 nonexistent or when standard treatment regimens fail.
5 THEREFORE, the Legislature enacts this act to provide important protections for health care providers
6 and to address health care workforce shortages in Montana.

11 provider, as defined in 50-16-504, may move to dismiss a complaint, information, or indictment against the
