REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, the Montana Procurement Act has several beneficial purposes, including ensuring fair and

providing for increased public confidence in the procedures followed by the state in procuring services; and
WHEREAS, all state agencies have a responsibility to adhere to the Montana Procurement Act to
ensure the responsible, consistent, and transparent use of public funds; and
WHEREAS, in recent years there have been multiple state agency procurements that have raised
questions about transparency and the appropriate use of public funds; and
WHEREAS, the Legislature has a vested interest in ensuring that all laws, including the Montana
Procurement Act, are adhered to.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF

selected outside of the standard procurement process;
(6) evaluate the contracts that have deviated from standard processes for signs of waste, fraud, or
abuse;

contracts; and
