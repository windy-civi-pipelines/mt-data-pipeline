Director Osmundson,
The Office of Public Instruction (OPI) appreciates the Governor’s efforts to advance a conservative budget that puts
Montana on a prosperous path. We also recognize the hard work done by legislators during the 69th legislative
session to advance education bills that put our students first. Knowing that difficult decisions must always be
made when allocating government resources, the OPI wants to be a pragmatic partner to ensure that resources are
most effectively directed and utilized.
HB462 appropriates $5 million to the OPI for implementation of newly revised state math standards that were
adopted by the Board of Public Education (BPE) last year, with a focus on developing High Quality Instructional
Materials (HQIM) for districts at a reduced cost. We appreciate Representative Bedey’s vision to ensure Montana
students have access to the best instructional materials. For background, BPE and OPI initiated the process of
revising standards for math between 2022-2024. Per MCA 2-4-405, OPI produced an economic impact statement
under the previous superintendent estimating the total state and local costs for implementing the new math
standards to be roughly $30 million.
However, we do not believe it would cost $30 million to implement the new math standards, which includes a
required third year of high school math instead of just two. OPI supported an HB2 appropriation of $2.5 million per
year of the 2027 biennium for the implementation of the new math standards, as well as HB462 which would tie
this HB2 appropriation to the HQIM policies contained in the bill.
OPI supports the policy goals of assisting schools with HQIM, but we also understand the budget constraints
currently facing the Governor. We believe that if HB462 is vetoed OPI could still work with the Interim Committees,
BPE, the Office of Commissioner of Higher Education, and local districts to implement the new math standards
and help schools with utilizing HQIM.
We appreciate the fiscal leadership demonstrated by the Governor and you during the legislative session, and we
value the opportunity to provide input. Please do not hesitate to reach out if we can provide additional information.
Best,
Susie Hedalen
Superintendent of Public Instruction
