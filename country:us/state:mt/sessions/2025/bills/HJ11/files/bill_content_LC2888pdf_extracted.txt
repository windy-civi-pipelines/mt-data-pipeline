4 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
5 MONTANA URGING CONGRESS TO CLARIFY THAT THE RIGHTS PROTECTED UNDER THE UNITED
6 STATES CONSTITUTION ARE THE RIGHTS OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOT THE RIGHTS OF
7 CORPORATIONS; PROVIDING THAT GOVERNMENTS MAY AND SHALL REGULATE CAMPAIGN
8 CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXPENDITURES TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM CORRUPTION
9 AND UNDUE OR DISPROPORTIONATE INFLUENCE IN ELECTIONS AND GOVERNMENT; AND ASKING
10 THAT CONGRESS PROPOSE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO PROVE THIS CLARIFICATION.
11
12 WHEREAS, neither the Constitution of the United States nor any of its several amendments make any
13 reference to corporations, unions, or other artificial, government-created entities, and the rights set forth in the
14 Constitution of the United States and its several amendments were originally conceived as inalienable rights
15 belonging inherently to human beings only; and
16 WHEREAS, in a number of cases, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that the right to
17 free speech recognized in the Constitution of the United States also belongs to corporations, unions, political
18 action committees, and other artificial entities; and
19 WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of the United States has also held that certain types of regulation of
20 campaign finance impermissibly abridge the right to free speech by human beings, corporations, unions,
21 political action committees, and other artificial entities, which limits the right of the American people to regulate
22 human beings, corporations, unions, political action committees, and other artificial entities through federal,
23 state, or local law; and
24 WHEREAS, the Supreme Court decisions and the lower court decisions predicated on the Supreme
25 Court decisions allow human beings, corporations, unions, political action committees, and other artificial
26 entities to spend virtually unlimited amounts of money in support of or against candidates and ballot measures,
27 undercutting the rights of citizens to prevent corruption and enjoy equal and meaningful participation in the
28 democratic process; and
- 1 - LC 2888
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2888
1 WHEREAS, this undermines public confidence in the democratic process and democratic institutions of
2 our nation; and
3 WHEREAS, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, introduced with bipartisan support by Senator John
4 McCain of Arizona and Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and passed in 2002 with the intent to preserve the
5 integrity of the United States' electoral system and reduce the role of money and corruption in politics, has been
6 undermined by the decisions of the Supreme Court; and
7 WHEREAS, the unique history of corrupt elections in Montana during the War of the Copper Kings
8 prompted the citizens of Montana to pass the Corrupt Practices Act of 1912 by initiative to take money out of
9 politics; and
10 WHEREAS, the decisions of the Supreme Court have undermined the will of the Montana people; and
11 WHEREAS, large amounts of outside spending by corporations, political action committees, super
12 political action committees, and others, often with untraceable sources, has created a crisis in Montana
13 elections, increasing partisanship, dividing Montanans, and making it more difficult for Montanans to discern
14 which candidates they wish to support; and
15 WHEREAS, Article V of the Constitution of the United States declares, "[t]he Congress, whenever two
16 thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution."

18 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
19 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
20 The state of Montana requests that Congress propose an amendment to the Constitution of the United
21 States that confirms that:

27 subject to regulation by the people through federal, state, or local law;

- 2 - LC 2888
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2888
1 expenditures, including a candidate's own contributions and expenditures, to ensure that all citizens have

3 money, substantially more access or ability to influence in any way the election of any candidate for public
4 office or any ballot measure;
5 (4) federal, state, and local governments shall require that THE contributions and expenditures be
6 publicly disclosed; and
7 (5) THE regulation and disclosure requirements enacted and performed in accordance with the
8 intents and purposes of THIS amendment MAY not be construed as a violation of the Constitution OF THE UNITED
9 STATES.
