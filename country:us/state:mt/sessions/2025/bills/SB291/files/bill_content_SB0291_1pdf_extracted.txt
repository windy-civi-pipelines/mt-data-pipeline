4 (a) employee expense reimbursements or allowances for meals, lodging, travel, subsistence, and
5 other expenses, as set forth in department rules;
6 (b) the amount of the payment made by the employer for employees, if the payment was made for:

20 hourly rate times the number of hours in a week for which the employee was hired to work.
21 (b) For good cause shown, if the use of the last four pay periods does not accurately reflect the
22 claimant's employment history with the employer, the wage may be calculated by dividing the total earnings for

24 period, including periods of idleness or seasonal fluctuations.
25 (4) (a) For the purpose of calculating compensation benefits for an employee working concurrent
26 employments, the average actual wages must be calculated as provided in subsection (3). As used in this
27 subsection, "concurrent employment" means employment in which the employee was actually employed at the

4 employment as a sole proprietor or partner who elected not to be covered, from which the volunteer is disabled
5 by the injury incurred.

7 employments must be based on the aggregate of average actual monetary wages of all employments, except
8 for the wages earned by individuals while engaged in the employments outlined in 39-71-401(3)(a) who elected
9 not to be covered, from which the employee is disabled by the injury incurred.
10 (5) For the purposes of calculating compensation benefits for an employee working for an
11 employer, as provided in 39-71-117(1)(d), and for calculating premiums to be paid by that employer, the wages
12 must be based upon all hours worked multiplied by the mean hourly wage by area, as published by the
13 department in the edition of Montana Informational Wage Rates by Occupation, adopted annually by the
14 department, that is in effect as of the date of injury or for the period in which the premium is due."
