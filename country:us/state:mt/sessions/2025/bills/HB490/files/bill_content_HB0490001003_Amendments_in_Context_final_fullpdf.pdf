Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Amy Regier - (H) Judiciary
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Griffin Burns, HB0490.001.003
1 for injury or damages arising from an act or omission of the electric facilities provider associated with
2 implementing a wildfire mitigation plan only if the party seeking recovery establishes:
3 (a) the electric facilities provider failed to exercise the degree of care, skill, and learning expected
4 of a reasonable, similarly situated electric facilities provider at the time in the state, acting under the same or
5 similar circumstances; and
6 (b) the failure was an actual and proximate cause of the injury to person or property for which
7 recovery is sought.
8 (4) After an electric facilities provider has commenced implementation of its wildfire mitigation plan,
9 in In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from the electric
10 facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a rebuttable
11 presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if, with respect to the place of the wildfire's
12 ignition, the electric facilities provider has adopted and, with respect to the place of the wildfire's ignition,
13 substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan that contains at a minimum the elements in [section 2(2)] was
14 approved in accordance with [section 2], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities provider's actual
15 incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be considered in determining
16 whether the electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan. The presumption in this
17 subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
18 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
19 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
20 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
21 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
22 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
23 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
24 (6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
25 liability, as required:
26 (a) a plaintiff may recover for real and personal property damage pursuant to 50-63-104;
27 (b) in the event of a bodily injury or death, a plaintiff may recover:
28 (i) economic damages, including medical expenses and lost wages; and

1 (ii) noneconomic damages;
2 (b)(c) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
3 death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
4 (c)(d) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
5 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
6 intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
7 electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
8 The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
9 (e) a person who obtains payment pursuant to a policy of insurance for damages resulting from a
10 wildfire loss is deemed to have been made whole exclusively for purposes of an insurer's right to subrogation
11 under this section.

13 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
14 limbs originating outside an area the electric facilities provider has a legal right to access or maintain caused
15 the wildfire's ignition, provided, however, this subsection does not alter the rights or obligations under 69-4-103.
16 (8)(6) A civil action against an electric facilities provider under this section must be commenced within
17 3 years from the date the plaintiff first incurred injury or damages, without regard to when the injury or damages
18 are discovered. If a plaintiff commences a civil action under this section, the plaintiff shall make service of
19 process no later than 6 months after filing the complaint. If service of process is not made within the 6-month
20 period, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to a defendant
21 unless that defendant has made an appearance in the civil action. If service of process is not made within the 6-
22 month period, the remaining 3-year period of limitations for a civil action under this section resumes, regardless
23 of whether the civil action is dismissed.
