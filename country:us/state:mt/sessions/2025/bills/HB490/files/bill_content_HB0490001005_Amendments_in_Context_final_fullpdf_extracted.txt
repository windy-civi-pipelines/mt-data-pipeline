4 (a) the electric facilities provider failed to exercise the degree of care, skill, and learning expected
5 of a reasonable, similarly situated electric facilities provider at the time in the state, acting under the same or
6 similar circumstances; and

19 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
20 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
21 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
22 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
23 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
24 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
25 (6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
26 liability, as required:
27 (a) a plaintiff may recover for real and personal property damage pursuant to 50-63-104;
28 (b) in the event of a bodily injury or death, a plaintiff may recover:

3 (b)(c) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
4 death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
5 (c)(d) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
6 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
7 intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
8 electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
9 The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
10 (e) a person who obtains payment pursuant to a policy of insurance for damages resulting from a
11 wildfire loss is deemed to have been made whole exclusively for purposes of an insurer's right to subrogation
12 under this section.

14 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
15 limbs originating outside an area the electric facilities provider has a legal right to access or maintain caused
16 the wildfire's ignition, provided, however, this subsection does not alter the rights or obligations under 69-4-103.

18 3 years from the date the plaintiff first incurred injury or damages, without regard to when the injury or damages
19 are discovered. If a plaintiff commences a civil action under this section, the plaintiff shall make service of
20 process no later than 6 months after filing the complaint. If service of process is not made within the 6-month
21 period, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to a defendant

1 arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities or
2 for injury or damages arising from an act or omission of the electric facilities provider associated with
3 implementing a wildfire mitigation plan only if the party seeking recovery establishes:
4 (a) the electric facilities provider failed to exercise the degree of care, skill, and learning expected
5 of a reasonable, similarly situated electric facilities provider at the time in the state, acting under the same or
6 similar circumstances; and
7 (b) the failure was an actual and proximate cause of the injury to person or property for which
8 recovery is sought.
9 (4) After an electric facilities provider has commenced implementation of its wildfire mitigation plan,
10 in In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from the electric
11 facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a rebuttable
12 presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if, with respect to the place of the wildfire's
13 ignition, the electric facilities provider has adopted and, with respect to the place of the wildfire's ignition,
14 substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan that contains at a minimum the elements in [section 2(2)] was
15 approved in accordance with [section 2], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities provider's actual
16 incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be considered in determining
17 whether the electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan. The presumption in this
18 subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
19 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
20 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
21 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
22 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
23 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
24 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
25 (6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
26 liability, as required:
27 (a) a plaintiff may recover for real and personal property damage pursuant to 50-63-104;
28 (b) in the event of a bodily injury or death, a plaintiff may recover:

1 (i) economic damages, including medical expenses and lost wages; and
2 (ii) noneconomic damages;
3 (b)(c) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
4 death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
5 (c)(d) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
6 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
7 intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
8 electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
9 The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
10 (e) a person who obtains payment pursuant to a policy of insurance for damages resulting from a
11 wildfire loss is deemed to have been made whole exclusively for purposes of an insurer's right to subrogation
12 under this section.
13 (7) An electric facilities provider may not be liable in an action brought under this section to the
14 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
15 limbs originating outside an area the electric facilities provider has a legal right to access or maintain caused
16 the wildfire's ignition, provided, however, this subsection does not alter the rights or obligations under 69-4-103.
17 (8)(6) A civil action against an electric facilities provider under this section must be commenced within
18 3 years from the date the plaintiff first incurred injury or damages, without regard to when the injury or damages
19 are discovered. If a plaintiff commences a civil action under this section, the plaintiff shall make service of
20 process no later than 6 months after filing the complaint. If service of process is not made within the 6-month
21 period, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to a defendant
22 unless that defendant has made an appearance in the civil action. If service of process is not made within the 6-
23 month period, the remaining 3-year period of limitations for a civil action under this section resumes, regardless
24 of whether the civil action is dismissed.
