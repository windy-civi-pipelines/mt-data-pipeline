1 MITIGATION PLAN, IN In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising
2 from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a
3 rebuttable presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if, WITH RESPECT TO THE PLACE OF THE
4 WILDFIRE'S IGNITION, the electric facilities provider has adopted and, with respect to the place of the wildfire's
5 ignition, substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan that contains at a minimum the elements in [section
6 2(2)] WAS APPROVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH [SECTION 2], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities
7 provider's actual incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be
8 considered in determining whether the electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation
9 plan. The presumption in this subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
10 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
11 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
12 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
13 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
14 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
15 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
16 (6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
17 liability, as required:
18 (a) a plaintiff may recover for real and personal property damage pursuant to 50-63-104;
19 (B) IN THE EVENT OF A BODILY INJURY OR DEATH, A PLAINTIFF MAY RECOVER:
20 (I) ECONOMIC DAMAGES, INCLUDING MEDICAL EXPENSES AND LOST WAGES; AND

22 (b)(C) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
23 death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
24 (c)(D) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
25 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
26 intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
27 electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
28 The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.

2 FROM A WILDFIRE LOSS IS DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE WHOLE EXCLUSIVELY FOR PURPOSES OF AN INSURER'S RIGHT
3 TO SUBROGATION UNDER THIS SECTION.

5 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
6 limbs originating outside an area the electric facilities provider has a legal right to access or maintain caused
7 the wildfire ' s ignition, provided, however, this subsection does not alter the rights or obligations under 69-4-
8 103.

11 (5) After a public meeting and no more than 60 days after the close of public comment, the
12 commission for a regulated utility shall identify any deficiencies in a wildfire mitigation plan and provide written
13 comments addressing whether the wildfire mitigation plan is reasonable, is in the public interest, and
14 reasonably balances the incremental costs of implementing the plan with the risk of a potential wildfire.
15 (6)(7) If an electric facilities provider prepares a wildfire mitigation plan in accordance with this
16 section, NO LATER THAN JUNE 1 OF EACH YEAR, the electric facilities provider shall submit to its governing body
17 APPROVAL AUTHORITY a biennial report summarizing the electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation efforts and
18 compliance with the ITS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED wildfire mitigation plan.
19 (8) FOR ANY JOINTLY OWNED ELECTRIC FACILITIES, THE OPERATOR SHALL PREPARE AND IMPLEMENT THE
20 REQUIRED WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN FOR THE JOINTLY OWNED ELECTRIC FACILITIES. IF AN OWNER OF A JOINTLY
21 OWNED ELECTRIC FACILITY IS A REGULATED UTILITY, THE COMMISSION IS THE APPROVAL AUTHORITY WHETHER OR NOT
22 THE OPERATOR IS A REGULATED UTILITY. THE OPERATOR'S SUBMISSION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A WILDFIRE
23 MITIGATION PLAN AS REQUIRED BY THIS SUBSECTION SATISFIES THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS SECTION FOR THE JOINTLY
24 OWNED ELECTRIC FACILITY ONLY.
25 (7)(8)(9) In accordance with the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, the commission may
26 make any necessary rules establishing procedures for the review and comment on a regulated utility's wildfire
27 mitigation plan, including for the appointment of a technical master to determine whether the wildfire mitigation
28 plan contains the required components in subsection (2).

5 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Electric facilities provider -- wildfire -- cause of action -- standard of
6 care -- damages. (1) The purpose of this section is to set statutory criteria governing the civil liability of an
7 electric facilities provider for wildfire-related claims. An electric facilities provider has an obligation to serve the
8 public, and a standard of strict liability may not be applied to an electric facilities provider as follows:
9 (a) in a cause of action alleging the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric
10 transmission and distribution activities caused wildfire-related damages; or
11 (b) in a cause of action alleging an electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation activities
12 conducted in accordance with a wildfire mitigation plan caused damages.
13 (2) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable only under the provisions of this section,
14 and may not be found civilly liable under any other statute, theory of recovery, or common law claim, for
15 wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric
16 transmission and distribution activities or for injury or damages arising from any act or omission of the electric
17 facilities provider associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan.
18 (3) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable for:
19 (A) wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities
20 or electric transmission and distribution activities; or for
21 (B) injury or damages arising from an act or omission of the electric facilities provider associated
22 with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan only if the party seeking recovery establishes:
23 (a)(I) the electric facilities provider failed to exercise the degree of care, skill, and learning expected
24 of a reasonable, similarly situated electric facilities provider at the time in the state, acting under the same or
25 similar circumstances; and
26 (b)(II) the failure was an actual and THE proximate cause of the injury to person or property for which
27 recovery is sought.

69th Legislature 2025 HB0490.4
1 MITIGATION PLAN, IN In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising
2 from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a
3 rebuttable presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if, WITH RESPECT TO THE PLACE OF THE
4 WILDFIRE'S IGNITION, the electric facilities provider has adopted and, with respect to the place of the wildfire's
5 ignition, substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan that contains at a minimum the elements in [section
6 2(2)] WAS APPROVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH [SECTION 2], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities
7 provider's actual incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be
8 considered in determining whether the electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation
9 plan. The presumption in this subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
10 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
11 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
12 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
13 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
14 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
15 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
16 (6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
17 liability, as required:
18 (a) a plaintiff may recover for real and personal property damage pursuant to 50-63-104;
19 (B) IN THE EVENT OF A BODILY INJURY OR DEATH, A PLAINTIFF MAY RECOVER:
20 (I) ECONOMIC DAMAGES, INCLUDING MEDICAL EXPENSES AND LOST WAGES; AND
21 (II) NONECONOMIC DAMAGES;
22 (b)(C) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
23 death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
24 (c)(D) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
25 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
26 intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
27 electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
28 The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.

4 (7) An electric facilities provider may not be liable in an action brought under this section to the
5 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
6 limbs originating outside an area the electric facilities provider has a legal right to access or maintain caused
7 the wildfire ' s ignition, provided, however, this subsection does not alter the rights or obligations under 69-4-
