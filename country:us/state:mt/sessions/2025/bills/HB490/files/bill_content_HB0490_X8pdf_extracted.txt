common law theory of ultrahazardous activity or being held liable for wildfires caused by factors beyond their
control; and

wildfire mitigation plan for the jointly owned electric facilities. If an owner of a jointly owned electric facility is a

the obligations under this section for the jointly owned electric facility only.
(9) In accordance with the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, the commission may make any
necessary rules establishing procedures for the review and comment on a regulated utility's wildfire mitigation
plan, including for the appointment of a technical master to determine whether the wildfire mitigation plan

facilities provider for wildfire-related claims. An electric facilities provider has an obligation to serve the public,
and a standard of strict liability may not be applied to an electric facilities provider as follows:
(a) in a cause of action alleging the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric
transmission and distribution activities caused wildfire-related damages; or
(b) in a cause of action alleging an electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation activities
conducted in accordance with a wildfire mitigation plan caused damages.
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 490
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 490
(2) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable only under the provisions of this section,
and may not be found civilly liable under any other statute, theory of recovery, or common law claim, for
wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric
transmission and distribution activities or for injury or damages arising from any act or omission of the electric
facilities provider associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan.
(3) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable for:
(a) wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities
or electric transmission and distribution activities; or
(b) injury or damages arising from an act or omission of the electric facilities provider associated
with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan only if the party seeking recovery establishes:
(i) the electric facilities provider failed to exercise the degree of care, skill, and learning expected
of a reasonable, similarly situated electric facilities provider at the time in the state, acting under the same or
similar circumstances; and
(ii) the failure was the proximate cause of the injury to person or property for which recovery is
sought.
(4) After an electric facilities provider has commenced implementation of its wildfire mitigation plan,
in an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from the electric
facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if, with respect to the place of the wildfire's
ignition, the electric facilities provider substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan that was approved in
accordance with [section 2], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities provider's actual incremental
costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be considered in determining whether the
electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan. The presumption in this subsection
(4) may be controverted by other evidence.
(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
liability, as required:
(a) a plaintiff may recover for real and personal property damage pursuant to 50-63-104;
(b) in the event of a bodily injury or death, a plaintiff may recover:
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 490
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 490
(i) economic damages, including medical expenses and lost wages; and
(ii) noneconomic damages;
(c) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
death;
(d) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
(e) a person who obtains payment pursuant to a policy of insurance for damages resulting from a
wildfire loss is deemed to have been made whole exclusively for purposes of an insurer's right to subrogation
under this section.
(6) A civil action against an electric facilities provider under this section must be commenced within
3 years from the date the plaintiff first incurred injury or damages, without regard to when the injury or damages
are discovered.
(7) This section does not affect express contractual rights of any person or entity in any way
involving communications facilities or the shared use of electric facilities or pole attachments.

Section 5:
Section 4. Notification to tribal governments. The secretary of state shall send a copy of [this act]
to each federally recognized tribal government in Montana.

Section 6:
Section 5. Codification instruction. [Sections 1 through 3] are intended to be codified as a new part
in Title 69, chapter 2, and the provisions of Title 69, chapter 2, apply to [sections 1 through 3].

Section 7:
Section 6. Severability. If a part of [this act] is invalid, all valid parts that are severable from the
invalid part remain in effect. If a part of [this act] is invalid in one or more of its applications, the part remains in
effect in all valid applications that are severable from the invalid applications.
