(a) in a cause of action alleging the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric
transmission and distribution activities caused wildfire-related damages; or
(b) in a cause of action alleging an electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation activities
conducted in accordance with a wildfire mitigation plan caused damages.
(2) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable only under the provisions of this section,
and may not be found civilly liable under any other statute, theory of recovery, or common law claim, for
wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric
transmission and distribution activities or for injury or damages arising from any act or omission of the electric
facilities provider associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan.
(3) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable for:
(a) wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities
or electric transmission and distribution activities; or for

approved in accordance with [section 2], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities provider's actual
incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be considered in determining
whether the electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan. The presumption in this
subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
(6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
liability, as required:

(ii) noneconomic damages;
(b)(c) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
(c)(d) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
(e) a person who obtains payment pursuant to a policy of insurance for damages resulting from a
wildfire loss is deemed to have been made whole exclusively for purposes of an insurer's right to subrogation
under this section.

substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan that contains at a minimum the elements in [section 2(2)] was
approved in accordance with [section 2], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities provider's actual
incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be considered in determining
whether the electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan. The presumption in this
subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
(6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
liability, as required:

(ii) noneconomic damages;
(b)(c) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
(c)(d) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
(e) a person who obtains payment pursuant to a policy of insurance for damages resulting from a
wildfire loss is deemed to have been made whole exclusively for purposes of an insurer's right to subrogation
under this section.

3 years from the date the plaintiff first incurred injury or damages, without regard to when the injury or damages
are discovered. If a plaintiff commences a civil action under this section, the plaintiff shall make service of
process no later than 6 months after filing the complaint. If service of process is not made within the 6-month
