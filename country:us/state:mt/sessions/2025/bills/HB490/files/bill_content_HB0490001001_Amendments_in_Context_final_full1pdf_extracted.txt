13 (a) in a cause of action alleging the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric

7 ignition, substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan that contains at a minimum the elements in [section
8 2(2)] was approved in accordance with [section 2], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities
9 provider's actual incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be

11 plan. The presumption in this subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
12 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
13 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
14 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
15 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
16 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
17 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
18 (6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
19 liability, as required:
20 (a) a plaintiff may recover for real and personal property damage pursuant to 50-63-104;
21 (b) in the event of a bodily injury or death, a plaintiff may recover:
22 (i) economic damages, including medical expenses and lost wages; and
23 (ii) noneconomic damages;
24 (b)(c) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
25 death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
26 (c)(d) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
27 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
28 intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the

2 The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
3 (7) An electric facilities provider may not be liable in an action brought under this section to the
4 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
5 limbs originating outside an area the electric facilities provider has a legal right to access or maintain caused
6 the wildfire's ignition, provided, however, this subsection does not alter the rights or obligations under 69-4-103.
7 (8)(6) A civil action against an electric facilities provider under this section must be commenced within
8 3 years from the date the plaintiff first incurred injury or damages, without regard to when the injury or damages

1 (b) the failure was an actual and proximate cause of the injury to person or property for which
2 recovery is sought.
3 (4) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
4 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a
5 rebuttable presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if, with respect to the place of the
6 wildfire's ignition, the electric facilities provider has adopted and, with respect to the place of the wildfire's
7 ignition, substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan that contains at a minimum the elements in [section
8 2(2)] was approved in accordance with [section 2], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities
9 provider's actual incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be
10 considered in determining whether the electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation
11 plan. The presumption in this subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
12 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
13 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
14 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
15 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
16 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
17 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
18 (6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
19 liability, as required:
20 (a) a plaintiff may recover for real and personal property damage pursuant to 50-63-104;
21 (b) in the event of a bodily injury or death, a plaintiff may recover:
22 (i) economic damages, including medical expenses and lost wages; and
23 (ii) noneconomic damages;
24 (b)(c) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
25 death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
26 (c)(d) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
27 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
28 intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the

4 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
