4 (A) wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities
5 or electric transmission and distribution activities; or for
6 (B) injury or damages arising from an act or omission of the electric facilities provider associated
7 with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan only if the party seeking recovery establishes:
8 (a)(I) the electric facilities provider failed to exercise the degree of care, best practices for the

10 electric facilities provider at the time in the state in the region, acting under the same or similar circumstances;
11 and
12 (b)(II) the failure was an actual and THE proximate cause of the injury to person or property for which
13 recovery is sought.
14 (4) AFTER AN ELECTRIC FACILITIES PROVIDER HAS COMMENCED IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS WILDFIRE
15 MITIGATION PLAN, IN In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising
16 from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a
17 rebuttable presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if, WITH RESPECT TO THE PLACE OF THE
18 WILDFIRE'S IGNITION, the electric facilities provider has adopted and, with respect to the place of the wildfire's
19 ignition, substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan that contains at a minimum the elements in [section
20 2(2)] WAS APPROVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH [SECTION 2], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities
21 provider's actual incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be
22 considered in determining whether the electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation
23 plan. The presumption in this subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
24 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
25 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
26 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
27 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
28 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution

10 (c)(D) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
11 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or

13 electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
14 The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
15 (E) A PERSON WHO OBTAINS PAYMENT PURSUANT TO A POLICY OF INSURANCE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING

22 103.
