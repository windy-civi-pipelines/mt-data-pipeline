1 commission for a regulated utility shall identify any deficiencies in a wildfire mitigation plan and provide written
2 comments addressing whether the wildfire mitigation plan is reasonable, is in the public interest, and
3 reasonably balances the incremental costs of implementing the plan with the risk of a potential wildfire.
4 (6)(7) If an electric facilities provider prepares a wildfire mitigation plan in accordance with this
5 section, NO LATER THAN JUNE 1 OF EACH YEAR, the electric facilities provider shall submit to its governing body
6 APPROVAL AUTHORITY a biennial report summarizing the electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation efforts and
7 compliance with the ITS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED wildfire mitigation plan.
8 (7)(8) In accordance with the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, the commission may make any
9 necessary rules establishing procedures for the review and comment on a regulated utility's wildfire mitigation
10 plan, including for the appointment of a technical master to determine whether the wildfire mitigation plan
11 contains the required components in subsection (2).
12 (9) NOTHING IN THIS SECTION MAY BE CONSTRUED TO CREATE A NEW LIABILITY, BASIS FOR CLAIM, OR
13 SEPARATE LEGAL CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING FROM THE REVIEW OR APPROVAL OF A WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN WHEN
14 NONE WOULD EXIST OTHERWISE.

16 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Electric facilities provider -- wildfire -- cause of action -- standard of
17 care -- damages. (1) The purpose of this section is to set statutory criteria governing the civil liability of an
18 electric facilities provider for wildfire-related claims. An electric facilities provider has an obligation to serve the
19 public, and a standard of strict liability may not be applied to an electric facilities provider as follows:
20 (a) in a cause of action alleging the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric
21 transmission and distribution activities caused wildfire-related damages; or
22 (b) in a cause of action alleging an electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation activities
23 conducted in accordance with a wildfire mitigation plan caused damages.
24 (2) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable only under the provisions of this section,
25 and may not be found civilly liable under any other statute, theory of recovery, or common law claim, for
26 wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric
27 transmission and distribution activities or for injury or damages arising from any act or omission of the electric
28 facilities provider associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan.

1 (3) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable for:
2 (A) wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities
3 or electric transmission and distribution activities; or for
4 (B) injury or damages arising from an act or omission of the electric facilities provider associated
5 with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan only if the party seeking recovery establishes:
6 (a)(I) the electric facilities provider failed to exercise the degree of care, skill, and learning expected
7 of a reasonable, similarly situated electric facilities provider at the time in the state, acting under the same or
8 similar circumstances; and
9 (b)(II) the failure was an actual and THE proximate cause of the injury to person or property for which
10 recovery is sought.
11 (4) AFTER AN ELECTRIC FACILITIES PROVIDER HAS COMMENCED IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS WILDFIRE
12 MITIGATION PLAN, IN In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising
13 from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a
14 rebuttable presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if the provider may argue that it
15 acted reasonably, WITH RESPECT TO THE PLACE OF THE WILDFIRE'S IGNITION, if the electric facilities provider has
16 adopted and, with respect to the place of the wildfire's ignition, substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan
17 that contains at a minimum the elements in [section 2(2)] WAS APPROVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH [SECTION 2],
18 provided that evidence related to the electric facilities provider's actual incremental costs associated with
19 implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be considered in determining whether the electric facilities
20 provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan. The presumption in this subsection (4) may be
21 controverted by other evidence.
22 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
23 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
24 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
25 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
26 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
27 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
28 (6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved

8 (c)(D) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
9 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or

13 (E) A PERSON WHO OBTAINS PAYMENT PURSUANT TO A POLICY OF INSURANCE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING

15 TO SUBROGATION UNDER THIS SECTION.
16 (7) An electric facilities provider may not be liable in an action brought under this section to the
17 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
18 limbs originating outside an area the electric facilities provider has a legal right to access or maintain caused
19 the wildfire ' s ignition, provided, however, this subsection does not alter the rights or obligations under 69-4-
20 103.
21 (8)(6) A civil action against an electric facilities provider under this section must be commenced within
22 3 years from the date the plaintiff first incurred injury or damages, without regard to when the injury or damages
23 are discovered. If a plaintiff commences a civil action under this section, the plaintiff shall make service of
24 process no later than 6 months after filing the complaint. If service of process is not made within the 6-month
25 period, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to a defendant
26 unless that defendant has made an appearance in the civil action. If service of process is not made within the 6-
27 month period, the remaining 3-year period of limitations for a civil action under this section resumes, regardless
