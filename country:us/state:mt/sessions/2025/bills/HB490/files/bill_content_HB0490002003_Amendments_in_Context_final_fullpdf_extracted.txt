12 MITIGATION PLAN, IN In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising
13 from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a
14 rebuttable presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if, WITH RESPECT TO THE PLACE OF THE
15 WILDFIRE'S IGNITION, the electric facilities provider has adopted and, with respect to the place of the wildfire's
16 ignition, substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan that contains at a minimum the elements in [section
17 2(2)] WAS APPROVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH [SECTION 2], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities
18 provider's actual incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be
19 considered in determining whether the electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation
20 plan. The presumption in this subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
21 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
22 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
23 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
24 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
25 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
26 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
27 (6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
28 liability, as required:

3 (I) ECONOMIC DAMAGES, INCLUDING MEDICAL EXPENSES AND LOST WAGES; AND
4 (II) NONECONOMIC DAMAGES;
5 (b)(C) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
6 death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
7 (c)(D) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
8 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
9 intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
10 electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
11 The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
12 (E) A PERSON WHO OBTAINS PAYMENT PURSUANT TO A POLICY OF INSURANCE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING
13 FROM A WILDFIRE LOSS IS DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE WHOLE EXCLUSIVELY FOR PURPOSES OF AN INSURER'S RIGHT
14 TO SUBROGATION UNDER THIS SECTION.
15 (7) An electric facilities provider may not be liable in an action brought under this section to the
16 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
17 limbs originating outside an area the electric facilities provider has a legal right to access or maintain caused
18 the wildfire ' s ignition, provided, however, this subsection does not alter the rights or obligations under 69-4-
19 103.
20 (8)(6) A civil action against an electric facilities provider under this section must be commenced within
21 3 years from the date the plaintiff first incurred injury or damages, without regard to when the injury or damages
22 are discovered. If a plaintiff commences a civil action under this section, the plaintiff shall make service of
23 process no later than 6 months after filing the complaint. If service of process is not made within the 6-month
24 period, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to a defendant
25 unless that defendant has made an appearance in the civil action. If service of process is not made within the 6-
26 month period, the remaining 3-year period of limitations for a civil action under this section resumes, regardless
27 of whether the civil action is dismissed.

6 APPROVAL AUTHORITY a biennial report summarizing the electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation efforts and
7 compliance with the ITS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED wildfire mitigation plan.
8 (7)(8) In accordance with the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, the commission may make any
9 necessary rules establishing procedures for the review and comment on a regulated utility's wildfire mitigation
10 plan, including for the appointment of a technical master to determine whether the wildfire mitigation plan
11 contains the required components in subsection (2).

15
16 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Electric facilities provider -- wildfire -- cause of action -- standard of
17 care -- damages. (1) The purpose of this section is to set statutory criteria governing the civil liability of an
18 electric facilities provider for wildfire-related claims. An electric facilities provider has an obligation to serve the
19 public, and a standard of strict liability may not be applied to an electric facilities provider as follows:
20 (a) in a cause of action alleging the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric
21 transmission and distribution activities caused wildfire-related damages; or
22 (b) in a cause of action alleging an electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation activities
23 conducted in accordance with a wildfire mitigation plan caused damages.
24 (2) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable only under the provisions of this section,
25 and may not be found civilly liable under any other statute, theory of recovery, or common law claim, for
26 wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric
27 transmission and distribution activities or for injury or damages arising from any act or omission of the electric
28 facilities provider associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan.

1 (3) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable for:
2 (a) wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities
3 or electric transmission and distribution activities; or for
4 (b) injury or damages arising from an act or omission of the electric facilities provider associated
5 with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan only if the party seeking recovery establishes:
6 (a)(i) the electric facilities provider failed to exercise the degree of care, skill, and learning expected
7 of a reasonable, similarly situated electric facilities provider at the time in the state, acting under the same or
8 similar circumstances; and
9 (b)(ii) the failure was an actual and the proximate cause of the injury to person or property for which
10 recovery is sought.
11 (4) AFTER AN ELECTRIC FACILITIES PROVIDER HAS COMMENCED IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS WILDFIRE
12 MITIGATION PLAN, IN In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising
13 from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a
14 rebuttable presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if, WITH RESPECT TO THE PLACE OF THE
15 WILDFIRE'S IGNITION, the electric facilities provider has adopted and, with respect to the place of the wildfire's
16 ignition, substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan that contains at a minimum the elements in [section
17 2(2)] WAS APPROVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH [SECTION 2], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities
18 provider's actual incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be
19 considered in determining whether the electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation
20 plan. The presumption in this subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
21 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
22 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
23 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
24 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
25 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
26 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
27 (6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
28 liability, as required:

1 (a) a plaintiff may recover for real and personal property damage pursuant to 50-63-104;
2 (B) IN THE EVENT OF A BODILY INJURY OR DEATH, A PLAINTIFF MAY RECOVER:
3 (I) ECONOMIC DAMAGES, INCLUDING MEDICAL EXPENSES AND LOST WAGES; AND
4 (II) NONECONOMIC DAMAGES;
5 (b)(C) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
6 death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
7 (c)(D) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
8 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
9 intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
10 electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
11 The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
12 (E) A PERSON WHO OBTAINS PAYMENT PURSUANT TO A POLICY OF INSURANCE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING
13 FROM A WILDFIRE LOSS IS DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE WHOLE EXCLUSIVELY FOR PURPOSES OF AN INSURER'S RIGHT
14 TO SUBROGATION UNDER THIS SECTION.
15 (7) An electric facilities provider may not be liable in an action brought under this section to the
16 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
17 limbs originating outside an area the electric facilities provider has a legal right to access or maintain caused
18 the wildfire ' s ignition, provided, however, this subsection does not alter the rights or obligations under 69-4-
19 103.
20 (8)(6) A civil action against an electric facilities provider under this section must be commenced within
21 3 years from the date the plaintiff first incurred injury or damages, without regard to when the injury or damages
22 are discovered. If a plaintiff commences a civil action under this section, the plaintiff shall make service of
23 process no later than 6 months after filing the complaint. If service of process is not made within the 6-month
24 period, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to a defendant
25 unless that defendant has made an appearance in the civil action. If service of process is not made within the 6-
26 month period, the remaining 3-year period of limitations for a civil action under this section resumes, regardless
27 of whether the civil action is dismissed.
