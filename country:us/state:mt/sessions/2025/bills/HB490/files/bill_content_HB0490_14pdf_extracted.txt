2 (a) initially review an electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation plan; and
3 (b) consider any input from a federal, tribal, state, or local entity, or other interested persons during

5 (5) After a public meeting and no more than 60 days after the close of public comment, the
6 commission for a regulated utility shall identify any deficiencies in a wildfire mitigation plan and provide written
7 comments addressing whether the wildfire mitigation plan is reasonable, is in the public interest, and
8 reasonably balances the incremental costs of implementing the plan with the risk of a potential wildfire.
9 (6) If an electric facilities provider prepares a wildfire mitigation plan in accordance with this
10 section, the electric facilities provider shall submit to its governing body a biennial report summarizing the
11 electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation efforts and compliance with the wildfire mitigation plan.
12 (7) In accordance with the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, the commission may make any

16
17 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Electric facilities provider -- wildfire -- cause of action -- standard of
18 care -- damages. (1) The purpose of this section is to set statutory criteria governing the civil liability of an
19 electric facilities provider for wildfire-related claims. An electric facilities provider has an obligation to serve the
20 public, and a standard of strict liability may not be applied to an electric facilities provider as follows:
21 (a) in a cause of action alleging the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric

23 (b) in a cause of action alleging an electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation activities
24 conducted in accordance with a wildfire mitigation plan caused damages.
25 (2) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable only under the provisions of this section,
26 and may not be found civilly liable under any other statute, theory of recovery, or common law claim, for
27 wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric
28 transmission and distribution activities or for injury or damages arising from any act or omission of the electric
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 490

69th Legislature 2025 HB 490.1
1 facilities provider associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan.
2 (3) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable for wildfire-related injury or damages
3 arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities or
4 for injury or damages arising from an act or omission of the electric facilities provider associated with
5 implementing a wildfire mitigation plan only if the party seeking recovery establishes:
6 (a) the electric facilities provider failed to exercise the degree of care, skill, and learning expected
7 of a reasonable, similarly situated electric facilities provider at the time in the state, acting under the same or
8 similar circumstances; and
9 (b) the failure was an actual and proximate cause of the injury to person or property for which
10 recovery is sought.
11 (4) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
12 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a
13 rebuttable presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if the electric facilities provider has
14 adopted and, with respect to the place of the wildfire's ignition, substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan
15 that contains at a minimum the elements in [section 2(2)], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities
16 provider's actual incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be
17 considered in determining whether the electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation
18 plan. The presumption in this subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
19 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
20 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
21 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
22 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
23 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
24 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
25 (6) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
26 liability, as required:
27 (a) a plaintiff may recover for real and personal property damage pursuant to 50-63-104;
28 (b) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 490
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 490.1
1 death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
2 (c) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
3 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
4 intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
5 electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
6 The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
7 (7) An electric facilities provider may not be liable in an action brought under this section to the
8 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
9 limbs originating outside an area the electric facilities provider has a legal right to access or maintain caused
10 the wildfire's ignition, provided, however, this subsection does not alter the rights or obligations under 69-4-103.
11 (8) A civil action against an electric facilities provider under this section must be commenced within
12 3 years from the date the plaintiff first incurred injury or damages, without regard to when the injury or damages
13 are discovered. If a plaintiff commences a civil action under this section, the plaintiff shall make service of
14 process no later than 6 months after filing the complaint. If service of process is not made within the 6-month
15 period, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to a defendant
16 unless that defendant has made an appearance in the civil action. If service of process is not made within the 6-
17 month period, the remaining 3-year period of limitations for a civil action under this section resumes, regardless
18 of whether the civil action is dismissed.
19
20 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Notification to tribal governments. The secretary of state shall send a
21 copy of [this act] to each federally recognized tribal government in Montana.
22
23 NEW SECTION. Section 5. Codification instruction. [Sections 1 through 3] are intended to be
24 codified as a new part in Title 69, chapter 2, and the provisions of Title 69, chapter 2, apply to [sections 1
25 through 3].
26
