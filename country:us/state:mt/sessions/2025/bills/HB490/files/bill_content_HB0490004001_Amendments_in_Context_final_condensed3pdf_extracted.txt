10 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Electric facilities provider -- wildfire -- cause of action -- standard of
11 care -- damages. (1) The purpose of this section is to set statutory criteria governing the civil liability of an
12 electric facilities provider for wildfire-related claims. An electric facilities provider has an obligation to serve the
13 public, and a standard of strict liability may not be applied to an electric facilities provider as follows:
14 (a) in a cause of action alleging the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric

21 transmission and distribution activities or for injury or damages arising from any act or omission of the electric
22 facilities provider associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan.

24 (A) wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities

1 (a)(I) the electric facilities provider failed to exercise the degree of care, skill, and learning expected
2 of a reasonable, similarly situated electric facilities provider at the time in the state, acting under the same or
3 similar circumstances; and
4 (b)(II) the failure was an actual and THE proximate cause of the injury to person or property for which
5 recovery is sought.
6 (4) AFTER AN ELECTRIC FACILITIES PROVIDER HAS COMMENCED IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS WILDFIRE
7 MITIGATION PLAN, IN In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising
8 from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a
9 rebuttable presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if the provider is entitled to argue it
10 acted reasonably, WITH RESPECT TO THE PLACE OF THE WILDFIRE'S IGNITION, if the electric facilities provider has
11 adopted and, with respect to the place of the wildfire's ignition, has substantially followed a wildfire mitigation
12 plan that contains at a minimum the elements in [section 2(2)] WAS APPROVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH [SECTION 2],
13 provided that evidence related to the electric facilities provider's actual incremental costs associated with
14 implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be considered in determining whether the electric facilities
15 provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan. The presumption in this subsection (4) may be
16 controverted by other evidence.
17 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
18 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
19 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
20 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
21 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
22 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
23 (6)(5) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
24 liability, as required:
25 (a) a plaintiff may recover for real and personal property damage pursuant to 50-63-104;

1 (II) NONECONOMIC DAMAGES;
2 (b)(C) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
3 death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
4 (c)(D) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
5 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
6 intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
7 electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
8 The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
9 (E) A PERSON WHO OBTAINS PAYMENT PURSUANT TO A POLICY OF INSURANCE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING
10 FROM A WILDFIRE LOSS IS DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE WHOLE EXCLUSIVELY FOR PURPOSES OF AN INSURER'S RIGHT
11 TO SUBROGATION UNDER THIS SECTION.
12 (7) An electric facilities provider may not be liable in an action brought under this section to the
13 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
14 limbs originating outside an area the electric facilities provider has a legal right to access or maintain caused
15 the wildfire ' s ignition, provided, however, this subsection does not alter the rights or obligations under 69-4-
16 103.
17 (8)(6) A civil action against an electric facilities provider under this section must be commenced within
18 3 years from the date the plaintiff first incurred injury or damages, without regard to when the injury or damages
19 are discovered. If a plaintiff commences a civil action under this section, the plaintiff shall make service of
20 process no later than 6 months after filing the complaint. If service of process is not made within the 6-month
21 period, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to a defendant
22 unless that defendant has made an appearance in the civil action. If service of process is not made within the 6-
23 month period, the remaining 3-year period of limitations for a civil action under this section resumes, regardless
24 of whether the civil action is dismissed.
25 (7) THIS SECTION DOES NOT AFFECT EXPRESS CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS OF ANY PERSON OR ENTITY IN ANY
