19 and
20 WHEREAS, in recognition of electric facilities providers' obligation to serve their customers and in order
21 to secure and sustain Montana's reliable provision of electricity and services associated with it at just and
22 reasonable rates, electric facilities providers must be encouraged and have the right to deliver and transmit
23 electricity throughout the state without fear or risk of being held strictly liable for wildfire losses under the
24 common law theory of ultrahazardous activity or being held liable for wildfires caused by factors beyond their
25 control; and
26 THEREFORE, the intent of the Legislature to protect electric facilities providers from strict liability and
27 uncertain common law standards of care in the event of an unintentionally or negligently caused wildfire and to

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Griffin Burns, HB0490.001.004
1 (4) For the purposes of [sections 1 through 3], the commission for a regulated utility, the board of
2 trustees for an electric cooperative, or the governing body of any other type of electric facilities provider must:
3 (a) initially review an electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation plan; and
4 (b) consider any input from a federal, tribal, state, or local entity, or other interested persons during
5 a public comment period not to exceed 45 days.
6 (5) After a public meeting and no more than 60 days after the close of public comment, the
7 commission for a regulated utility shall identify any deficiencies in a wildfire mitigation plan and provide written
8 comments addressing whether the wildfire mitigation plan is reasonable, is in the public interest, and
9 reasonably balances the incremental costs of implementing the plan with the risk of a potential wildfire.
10 (6) If an electric facilities provider prepares a wildfire mitigation plan in accordance with this
11 section, the electric facilities provider shall submit to its governing body a biennial report summarizing the
12 electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation efforts and compliance with the wildfire mitigation plan.
13 (7) In accordance with the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, the commission may make any
14 necessary rules establishing procedures for the review and comment on a regulated utility's wildfire mitigation
15 plan, including for the appointment of a technical master to determine whether the wildfire mitigation plan

17
18 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Electric facilities provider -- wildfire -- cause of action -- standard of
19 care -- damages. (1) The purpose of this section is to set statutory criteria governing the civil liability of an
20 electric facilities provider for wildfire-related claims. An electric facilities provider has an obligation to serve the
21 public, and a standard of strict liability may not be applied to an electric facilities provider as follows:
22 (a) in a cause of action alleging the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric
23 transmission and distribution activities caused wildfire-related damages; or
24 (b) in a cause of action alleging an electric facilities provider's wildfire mitigation activities
25 conducted in accordance with a wildfire mitigation plan caused damages.
26 (2) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable only under the provisions of this section,
27 and may not be found civilly liable under any other statute, theory of recovery, or common law claim, for
28 wildfire-related injury or damages arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Amy Regier - (H) Judiciary
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Griffin Burns, HB0490.001.004
1 transmission and distribution activities or for injury or damages arising from any act or omission of the electric
2 facilities provider associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan.
3 (3) An electric facilities provider may be found civilly liable for wildfire-related injury or damages
4 arising from the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities or
5 for injury or damages arising from an act or omission of the electric facilities provider associated with
6 implementing a wildfire mitigation plan only if the party seeking recovery establishes:
7 (a) the electric facilities provider failed to exercise the degree of care, skill, and learning expected
8 of a reasonable, similarly situated electric facilities provider at the time in the state, acting under the same or
9 similar circumstances; and
10 (b) the failure was an actual and proximate cause of the injury to person or property for which
11 recovery is sought.
12 (4) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
13 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, there is a
14 rebuttable presumption that the electric facilities provider acted reasonably if the electric facilities provider has
15 adopted and, with respect to the place of the wildfire's ignition, substantially followed a wildfire mitigation plan
16 that contains at a minimum the elements in [section 2(2)], provided that evidence related to the electric facilities
17 provider's actual incremental costs associated with implementing a wildfire mitigation plan may not be
18 considered in determining whether the electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation
19 plan. The presumption in this subsection (4) may be controverted by other evidence.
20 (5) In an action against an electric facilities provider seeking wildfire-related damages arising from
21 the electric facilities provider's electric facilities or electric transmission and distribution activities, the absence of
22 a wildfire mitigation plan may not be construed as evidence of or an inference that the electric facilities provider
23 did not meet the standard in subsection (3)(a), and the fact finder may consider only acts that may have caused
24 the wildfire's ignition and evaluate the electric facilities provider's acts and electric transmission and distribution
25 activities in the context of the electric facilities provider's overall systems, processes, and programs.
26 (6) In an action against an electric facilities provider under this section, if a plaintiff has proved
27 liability, as required:
28 (a) a plaintiff may recover for real and personal property damage pursuant to 50-63-104;

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Amy Regier - (H) Judiciary
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Griffin Burns, HB0490.001.004
1 (b) a plaintiff may not recover noneconomic losses unless the plaintiff suffered bodily injury or
2 death proximately caused by the wildfire; and
3 (c) an electric facilities provider may not be assessed punitive damages unless there is a showing,
4 by clear and convincing evidence, that the electric facilities provider's actions were grossly negligent or
5 intentional. An electric facilities provider's acts or omissions may not be considered grossly negligent if the
6 electric facilities provider substantially followed its wildfire mitigation plan with respect to the place of ignition.
7 The availability of punitive damages is otherwise subject to the provisions of 27-1-220 and 27-1-221.
8 (7) An electric facilities provider may not be liable in an action brought under this section to the
9 extent that the electric facilities provider establishes that contact between electric facilities and trees or tree
10 limbs originating outside an area the electric facilities provider has a legal right to access or maintain caused
11 the wildfire's ignition, provided, however, this subsection does not alter the rights or obligations under 69-4-103.
12 (8) A civil action against an electric facilities provider under this section must be commenced within
13 3 years from the date the plaintiff first incurred injury or damages, without regard to when the injury or damages
14 are discovered. If a plaintiff commences a civil action under this section, the plaintiff shall make service of
15 process no later than 6 months after filing the complaint. If service of process is not made within the 6-month
16 period, the court, on motion or on its own initiative, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to a defendant
17 unless that defendant has made an appearance in the civil action. If service of process is not made within the 6-
18 month period, the remaining 3-year period of limitations for a civil action under this section resumes, regardless
19 of whether the civil action is dismissed.
20
21 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Notification to tribal governments. The secretary of state shall send a
22 copy of [this act] to each federally recognized tribal government in Montana.
23
24 NEW SECTION. Section 5. Codification instruction. [Sections 1 through 3] are intended to be
25 codified as a new part in Title 69, chapter 2, and the provisions of Title 69, chapter 2, apply to [sections 1
26 through 3].
27
28 NEW SECTION. Section 6. Severability. If a part of [this act] is invalid, all valid parts that are
