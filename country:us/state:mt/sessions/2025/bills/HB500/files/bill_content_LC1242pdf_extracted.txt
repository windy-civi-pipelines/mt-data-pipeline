8 include those optional services listed in subsections (4)(a) through (4)(s) that the department in its discretion
9 specifies by rule. The department, in exercising its discretion, may consider the amount of funds appropriated

20 mental illness and co-occurring disorders by doing the following:
21 (i) simplifying administrative rules, payment methods, and contracting processes for providing
22 services to individuals of different ages, diagnoses, and treatments. Any adjustments to payments must be
23 cost-neutral for the biennium beginning July 1, 2017.
24 (ii) publishing a report on an annual basis that describes the process that a mental health center or
25 chemical dependency facility, as those terms are defined in 50-5-101, must utilize in order to receive payment
26 from Montana medicaid for services provided to individuals of different ages, diagnoses, and treatments.
27 (9) The services provided under this part may be only those that are medically necessary and that
28 are the most efficient and cost-effective.

17 services made available under the Montana medicaid program after taking into consideration the funding
18 principles set forth in subsection (2). (Subsection (3)(o) terminates September 30, 2025--sec. 1, Ch. 298, L.
