16 changes and an estimated budget impact to the department over the next 4 fiscal years.
17 (13) If available funds are not sufficient to provide medical assistance for all eligible persons, the
18 department may set priorities to limit, reduce, or otherwise curtail the amount, scope, or duration of the medical
19 services made available under the Montana medicaid program after taking into consideration the funding
20 principles set forth in subsection (2). (Subsection (3)(o) terminates September 30, 2025--sec. 1, Ch. 298, L.

4 (6) In accordance with federal law or waivers of federal law that are granted by the secretary of the

8 medical assistance only who are covered under a group related to a program providing cash assistance, as

10 include those optional services listed in subsections (4)(a) through (4)(s) that the department in its discretion
11 specifies by rule. The department, in exercising its discretion, may consider the amount of funds appropriated
12 by the legislature, whether approval has been received, as provided in 53-1-612, and whether the provision of a
13 particular service is commonly covered by private health insurance plans. However, a recipient who is
14 pregnant, meets the criteria for disability provided in Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 416, et seq., or
15 is less than 21 years of age is entitled to full medicaid coverage.

23 (i) simplifying administrative rules, payment methods, and contracting processes for providing
24 services to individuals of different ages, diagnoses, and treatments. Any adjustments to payments must be
25 cost-neutral for the biennium beginning July 1, 2017.
26 (ii) publishing a report on an annual basis that describes the process that a mental health center or
27 chemical dependency facility, as those terms are defined in 50-5-101, must utilize in order to receive payment
28 from Montana medicaid for services provided to individuals of different ages, diagnoses, and treatments.

18 department may set priorities to limit, reduce, or otherwise curtail the amount, scope, or duration of the medical
19 services made available under the Montana medicaid program after taking into consideration the funding
20 principles set forth in subsection (2). (Subsection (3)(o) terminates September 30, 2025--sec. 1, Ch. 298, L.
