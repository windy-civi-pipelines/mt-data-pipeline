Section 3:
SECTION 1
PURPOSE
In order to strengthen access to medical services, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of
medical services, the participating states of the PA licensure compact have allied in common purpose to
develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of state licensing boards to license
and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the portability of a license to practice as a PA while safeguarding the
safety of patients. This compact allows medical services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual recognition of
the licensee's qualifying license by other compact participating states. This compact also adopts the prevailing
standard for PA licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by the PA occurs where
the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter and therefore requires the PA to be under the
jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the patient is located. State licensing boards that participate in
this compact retain the jurisdiction to impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that state issued to
a PA through the procedures of this compact. The PA licensure compact will alleviate burdens for military
families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on
having an unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state.

shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from any other participating state as it would

participating state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.
(5) A participating state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover from the affected PA the
costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that PA.
(6) A participating state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of a remote state,
provided that the participating state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.

compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
(3) The rules of the commission have the force of law in each participating state, provided however
that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the participating state that establish the medical
services a PA may perform in the participating state, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of
the commission are ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
(4) If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a commission rule, by
enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt this compact within 4 years of the date
of adoption of the rule, then such rule has no further force and effect in any participating state or to any state
applying to participate in the compact.
(5) Commission rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
(6) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission, and at least 30
days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a
notice of proposed rulemaking:
(a) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;
(b) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices of proposed rulemaking;

and
(c) in such other ways as the commission may by rule specify.
(7) The notice of proposed rulemaking must include:

date, and location of the meeting in which the proposed rule will be considered and voted upon;
(b) the text of the proposed rule and the reason for the proposed rule;

their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.
(b) Hearings must be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair
and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.
(c) All hearings must be recorded. A copy of the recording and the written comments, data, facts,
opinions, and arguments received in response to the proposed rulemaking must be made available to a person
upon request.
(d) Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each proposed

ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183
and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of
the rule.
(a) If adopted, the rule must be posted on the commission's website.
(b) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge
the original purpose of the proposed rule.

changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
recommended by commenters.
(d) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
emergency as provided in subsection (12), the effective date of the rule must be no sooner than 30 days after
the commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule.
(12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
emergency rule with 24 hours' prior notice, without the opportunity for comment or hearing, provided that the
usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section are retroactively applied to the rule as
soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes
of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately by the commission in order to:

notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision takes effect without further action. If the revision is
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183
challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.
(14) No participating state's rulemaking requirements may apply under this compact.

Section 14:
SECTION 10
OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
(1) Oversight:
(a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each participating state shall
enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
(b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission must be brought solely
and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
(c) The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
enforcement or interpretation of the compact or the commission's rules and shall have standing to intervene in
such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission with service of process renders a
judgment or order in such proceeding void as to the commission, this compact, or commission rules.
(2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:
(a) If the commission determines that a participating state has defaulted in the performance of its
obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the commission rules, the commission shall provide written
notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The notice must describe the default, the proposed
means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may take and must offer remedial
training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
(b) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from this
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights,
privileges and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may be terminated on the effective date of
termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
the period of default.
(c) Termination of participation in this compact may be imposed only after all other means of
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183
securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
commission to the governor, to the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and to the
licensing board or boards of each of the participating states.
(d) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
termination.
(e) The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
has been terminated from this compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
defaulting state.
(f) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the compact by the commission by
petitioning the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
principal offices. The prevailing member must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
attorney fees.
(g) Upon the termination of a state's participation in the compact, the state shall immediately
provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination:
(i) Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that state must retain the compact
privilege for 180 days following the effective date of such termination.
(ii) Licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted a compact privilege in a
participating state must retain the compact privilege for 180 days unless the licensee also has a qualifying
license in a participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating state before the 180-day period
ends, in which case the compact privilege must continue.
(3) Dispute resolution:
(a) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related
to this compact that arise among participating states and between participating and nonparticipating states.
(b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
resolution for disputes as appropriate.
(4) Enforcement:
(a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183
compact and rules of the commission.
(b) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance have been exhausted, by
majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action, in the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or
the federal district where the commission has its principal offices, against a participating state in default to
enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and the commission's promulgated rules and bylaws.
The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(c) The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission
may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
(5) Legal action against the commission:
(a) A participating state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court
for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce
compliance with the provisions of the compact and its rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of
such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(b) No person other than a participating state may enforce this compact against the commission.

Section 15:
SECTION 11
DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PA LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION
(1) This compact comes into effect on the date on which this compact statute is enacted into law in
the seventh participating state.
(a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the
enactment of each of the states that enacted the compact prior to the commission convening ("charter
participating states") to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter participating state is materially
different than the model compact.
(i) A charter participating state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
compact is entitled to the default process set forth in section 10(2).
(ii) If any participating state later withdraws from the compact or its participation is terminated, the
commission remains in existence and the compact remains in effect even if the number of participating states is
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183
fewer than seven. Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the commission convening are
subject to the process set forth in section 7(3)(u) to determine if their enactments are materially different from
the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
(b) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter participating
states are subject to the process set forth in section 7(3)(u) to determine if their enactments are materially
different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
(c) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the
administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
existence are considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission.
(2) Any state that joins this compact is subject to the commission's rules and bylaws as they exist
on the date on which this compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the
commission has the full force and effect of law on the day this compact becomes law in that state.
(3) Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the
same.
(a) A participating state's withdrawal does not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the
repealing statute. During this 180-day period, all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state
and were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state remain in effect. If any licensee licensed in the
withdrawing state is also licensed in another participating state or obtains a license in another participating state
within the 180 days, the licensee's compact privileges in other participating states may not be affected by the
passage of the 180 days.
(b) Withdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement of the state licensing board or boards of
the withdrawing state to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this
compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
(c) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this compact, the state shall
immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall
continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of
such notice of withdrawal.
(4) Nothing contained in this compact may be construed to invalidate or prevent any PA licensure
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183
agreement or other cooperative arrangement between participating states and between a participating state
and nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
(5) This compact may be amended by the participating states. No amendment to this compact may
become effective and binding upon any participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner into
the laws of all participating states as determined by the commission.

Section 16:
SECTION 12
CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
(1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed so as to
effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's
rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
(2) The provisions of this compact are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision
of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating
state, of a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any
government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency,
person, or circumstance is not affected thereby.
(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) or this section, the commission may deny a state's participation
in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 10(2), terminate a participating state's
participation in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would
be with respect to a state seeking to participate in the compact, a material departure from the compact.
Otherwise, if this compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact
remains in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force and effect as to the
participating state affected as to all severable matters.

Section 17:
SECTION 13
BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT
(1) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a participating state that is not
inconsistent with this compact.

(2) Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this compact are superseded to the extent of the
conflict.
(3) All agreements between the commission and the participating states are binding in accordance
with their terms.

AN ACT ADOPTING THE PA LICENSURE COMPACT; PROVIDING FOR A COMPACT PRIVILEGE FOR
PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS; PROVIDING DEFINITIONS; PROVIDING RULEMAKING AUTHORITY;
REQUIRING CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR LICENSURE; AND AMENDING SECTION 37-20-402,
MCA.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
Section 1. Enactment -- provisions. The PA licensure compact is enacted into law and entered into
with all jurisdictions legally joining the compact, in the form substantially as follows:
SECTION 1
PURPOSE
In order to strengthen access to medical services, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of
medical services, the participating states of the PA licensure compact have allied in common purpose to
develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of state licensing boards to license
and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the portability of a license to practice as a PA while safeguarding the
safety of patients. This compact allows medical services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual recognition of
the licensee's qualifying license by other compact participating states. This compact also adopts the prevailing
standard for PA licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by the PA occurs where
the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter and therefore requires the PA to be under the
jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the patient is located. State licensing boards that participate in
this compact retain the jurisdiction to impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that state issued to
a PA through the procedures of this compact. The PA licensure compact will alleviate burdens for military
families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on
having an unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state.

adverse action, 2 years must have elapsed from the date on which the license or compact privilege is no longer
limited or restricted due to the adverse action;
(ii) if a compact privilege has been revoked or is limited or restricted in a participating state for

69th Legislature 2025 HB 183
LICENSEE IS APPLYING FOR A COMPACT PRIVILEGE
Upon a licensee's application for a compact privilege, the licensee shall identify to the commission the
participating state from which the licensee is applying, in accordance with applicable rules adopted by the
commission, and subject to the following requirements:
(1) When applying for a compact privilege, the licensee shall provide the commission with the
address of the licensee's primary residence and thereafter shall immediately report to the commission any
change in the address of the licensee's primary residence.
(2) When applying for a compact privilege, the licensee is required to consent to accept service of
process by mail at the licensee's primary residence on file with the commission with respect to any action
brought against the licensee by the commission or a participating state, including a subpoena, with respect to
any action brought or investigation conducted by the commission or a participating state.
SECTION 6
ADVERSE ACTIONS
(1) A participating state in which a licensee is licensed shall have exclusive power to impose
adverse action against the qualifying license issued by that participating state.
(2) (a) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a remote state has the authority, in
accordance with existing state due process law, to do all of the following:
(i) take adverse action against a PA's compact privilege within that state to remove a licensee's
compact privilege or take other action necessary under applicable law to protect the health and safety of its
citizens;
(ii) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and
testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a
participating state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another
participating state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The
issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service
statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.

gather evidence of conduct in another state that is lawful in that other state for the purpose of taking adverse
action against a licensee's compact privilege or application for a compact privilege in that participating state.

compact privilege or to deny an application for a compact privilege in that participating state for the individual's
otherwise lawful practice in another state.
(4) For purposes of taking adverse action, the participating state that issued the qualifying license
shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from any other participating state as it would
if the conduct had occurred within the participating state that issued the qualifying license. In so doing, that
participating state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.
(5) A participating state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover from the affected PA the
costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that PA.
(6) A participating state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of a remote state,
provided that the participating state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.

regulations or other applicable state law, any participating state may participate with other participating states in
joint investigations of licensees.

furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under this compact.

state license. All disciplinary orders by the participating state which issued the qualifying license that impose

(4) If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a commission rule, by

and
(c) in such other ways as the commission may by rule specify.

ENROLLED BILL

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183
and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of
the rule.
(a) If adopted, the rule must be posted on the commission's website.

revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge
must be made as set forth in the notice of revisions and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the
notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision takes effect without further action. If the revision is

challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.
(14) No participating state's rulemaking requirements may apply under this compact.
SECTION 10
OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
(1) Oversight:
(a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each participating state shall
enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
(b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission must be brought solely
and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
(c) The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
enforcement or interpretation of the compact or the commission's rules and shall have standing to intervene in
such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission with service of process renders a
judgment or order in such proceeding void as to the commission, this compact, or commission rules.
(2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:
(a) If the commission determines that a participating state has defaulted in the performance of its
obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the commission rules, the commission shall provide written
notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The notice must describe the default, the proposed
means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may take and must offer remedial
training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
(b) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from this
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights,
privileges and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may be terminated on the effective date of
termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
the period of default.
(c) Termination of participation in this compact may be imposed only after all other means of
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
ENROLLED BILL

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183
securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
commission to the governor, to the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and to the
licensing board or boards of each of the participating states.
(d) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
termination.
(e) The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
has been terminated from this compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
defaulting state.
(f) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the compact by the commission by
petitioning the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
principal offices. The prevailing member must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
attorney fees.
(g) Upon the termination of a state's participation in the compact, the state shall immediately
provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination:
(i) Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that state must retain the compact
privilege for 180 days following the effective date of such termination.
(ii) Licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted a compact privilege in a
participating state must retain the compact privilege for 180 days unless the licensee also has a qualifying
license in a participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating state before the 180-day period
ends, in which case the compact privilege must continue.
(3) Dispute resolution:
(a) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related
to this compact that arise among participating states and between participating and nonparticipating states.
(b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
resolution for disputes as appropriate.
(4) Enforcement:
(a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
ENROLLED BILL

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183
compact and rules of the commission.
(b) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance have been exhausted, by
majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action, in the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or
the federal district where the commission has its principal offices, against a participating state in default to
enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and the commission's promulgated rules and bylaws.
The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is

(c) The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission
may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
(5) Legal action against the commission:
(a) A participating state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court
for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce
compliance with the provisions of the compact and its rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of
such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(b) No person other than a participating state may enforce this compact against the commission.
SECTION 11
DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PA LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION
(1) This compact comes into effect on the date on which this compact statute is enacted into law in
the seventh participating state.
(a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the
enactment of each of the states that enacted the compact prior to the commission convening ("charter
participating states") to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter participating state is materially
different than the model compact.
(i) A charter participating state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
compact is entitled to the default process set forth in section 10(2).
(ii) If any participating state later withdraws from the compact or its participation is terminated, the
commission remains in existence and the compact remains in effect even if the number of participating states is

fewer than seven. Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the commission convening are
subject to the process set forth in section 7(3)(u) to determine if their enactments are materially different from
the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
(b) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter participating
states are subject to the process set forth in section 7(3)(u) to determine if their enactments are materially
different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
(c) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the
administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
existence are considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission.
(2) Any state that joins this compact is subject to the commission's rules and bylaws as they exist
on the date on which this compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the
commission has the full force and effect of law on the day this compact becomes law in that state.
(3) Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the
same.
(a) A participating state's withdrawal does not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the
repealing statute. During this 180-day period, all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state
and were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state remain in effect. If any licensee licensed in the
withdrawing state is also licensed in another participating state or obtains a license in another participating state
within the 180 days, the licensee's compact privileges in other participating states may not be affected by the
passage of the 180 days.
(b) Withdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement of the state licensing board or boards of
the withdrawing state to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this
compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
(c) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this compact, the state shall
immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall
continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of
such notice of withdrawal.
(4) Nothing contained in this compact may be construed to invalidate or prevent any PA licensure

agreement or other cooperative arrangement between participating states and between a participating state
and nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
(5) This compact may be amended by the participating states. No amendment to this compact may
become effective and binding upon any participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner into
the laws of all participating states as determined by the commission.
SECTION 12
CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
(1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed so as to
effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's
rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
(2) The provisions of this compact are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision
of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating
state, of a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any
government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency,
person, or circumstance is not affected thereby.
(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) or this section, the commission may deny a state's participation
in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 10(2), terminate a participating state's
participation in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would
be with respect to a state seeking to participate in the compact, a material departure from the compact.
Otherwise, if this compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact
remains in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force and effect as to the
participating state affected as to all severable matters.
SECTION 13
BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT
(1) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a participating state that is not
inconsistent with this compact.
