4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: "AN ACT ADOPTING THE PA LICENSURE COMPACT; PROVIDING FOR A

6 RULEMAKING AUTHORITY; REQUIRING CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR LICENSURE; AND
7 AMENDING SECTION 37-20-402, MCA."

9 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
10
11 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Enactment -- provisions. The PA licensure compact is enacted into law
12 and entered into with all jurisdictions legally joining the compact, in the form substantially as follows:
13 SECTION 1
14 PURPOSE
15 In order to strengthen access to medical services, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of
16 medical services, the participating states of the PA licensure compact have allied in common purpose to
17 develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of state licensing boards to license
18 and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the portability of a license to practice as a PA while safeguarding the
19 safety of patients. This compact allows medical services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual recognition of
20 the licensee's qualifying license by other compact participating states. This compact also adopts the prevailing
21 standard for PA licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by the PA occurs where
22 the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter and therefore requires the PA to be under the
23 jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the patient is located. State licensing boards that participate in
24 this compact retain the jurisdiction to impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that state issued to
25 a PA through the procedures of this compact. The PA licensure compact will alleviate burdens for military
26 families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on
27 having an unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state.

17 (e) Nothing herein may be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for professional
18 malpractice or misconduct, which must be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
19 (f) Nothing herein may be construed to designate the venue or jurisdiction to bring actions for
20 alleged acts of malpractice, professional misconduct, negligence, or other such civil action pertaining to the
21 practice of a PA. All such matters must be determined exclusively by state law other than this compact.
22 (g) Nothing in this compact may be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a participating
23 state's state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the
24 Sherman Act, Clayton Act, or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or regulation.
25 (h) Nothing in this compact may be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity by the
26 participating states or by the commission.

12 reporting of any criminal history record information where prohibited by law;
13 (e) the existence of significant investigative information; and
14 (f) other information that may facilitate the administration of this compact, as determined by the

21 (5) Participating states contributing information to the data system may, in accordance with state or

7 section and the rules adopted thereunder. Commission rules are binding as of the date specified by the
8 commission for each rule.
9 (2) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
10 implement and administer this compact and achieve its purposes. A commission rule is invalid and does not
11 have force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the
12 commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this
13 compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
14 (3) The rules of the commission have the force of law in each participating state, provided however
15 that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the participating state that establish the medical
16 services a PA may perform in the participating state, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of
17 the commission are ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
18 (4) If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a commission rule, by
19 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt this compact within 4 years of the date
20 of adoption of the rule, then such rule has no further force and effect in any participating state or to any state
21 applying to participate in the compact.
22 (5) Commission rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
23 (6) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission, and at least 30
24 days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a
25 notice of proposed rulemaking:
26 (a) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;
27 (b) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices of proposed rulemaking;
28 and
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 (c) in such other ways as the commission may by rule specify.
2 (7) The notice of proposed rulemaking must include:

4 date, and location of the meeting in which the proposed rule will be considered and voted upon;
5 (b) the text of the proposed rule and the reason for the proposed rule;
6 (c) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person and the date by which
7 written comments must be received; and
8 (d) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the commission of their intention
9 to attend the public hearing or provide any written comments.
10 (8) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow persons to submit written data,
11 facts, opinions, and arguments, which must be made available to the public.
12 (9) If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the commission shall publish the mechanism
13 for access to the electronic hearing.
14 (a) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall, as directed in the notice of proposed
15 rulemaking, not less than 5 business days before the scheduled date of the hearing notify the commission of
16 their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.
17 (b) Hearings must be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair
18 and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.
19 (c) All hearings must be recorded. A copy of the recording and the written comments, data, facts,
20 opinions, and arguments received in response to the proposed rulemaking must be made available to a person
21 upon request.
22 (d) Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each proposed
23 rule. Proposed rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this
24 section.
25 (10) Following the public hearing, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments
26 timely received.
27 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take final action on the proposed rule
28 and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183

69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 the rule.
2 (a) If adopted, the rule must be posted on the commission's website.
3 (b) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge
4 the original purpose of the proposed rule.
5 (c) The commission shall provide on its website an explanation of the reasons for substantive
6 changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
7 recommended by commenters.
8 (d) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
9 emergency as provided in subsection (12), the effective date of the rule must be no sooner than 30 days after
10 the commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule.
11 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
12 emergency rule with 24 hours' prior notice, without the opportunity for comment or hearing, provided that the
13 usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section are retroactively applied to the rule as
14 soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes
15 of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately by the commission in order to:
16 (a) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
17 (b) prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds;
18 (c) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a commission rule that is established by federal law or
19 rule; or
20 (d) protect public health and safety.
21 (13) The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a
22 previously adopted commission rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in
23 consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions must be posted on the website of the
24 commission. The revision is subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The
25 revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge
26 must be made as set forth in the notice of revisions and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the
27 notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision takes effect without further action. If the revision is
28 challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.

69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 (14) No participating state's rulemaking requirements may apply under this compact.
2 SECTION 10
3 OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
4 (1) Oversight:
5 (a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each participating state shall
6 enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
7 (b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission must be brought solely
8 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
9 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
10 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
11 in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
12 (c) The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
13 enforcement or interpretation of the compact or the commission's rules and shall have standing to intervene in
14 such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission with service of process renders a
15 judgment or order in such proceeding void as to the commission, this compact, or commission rules.
16 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:
17 (a) If the commission determines that a participating state has defaulted in the performance of its
18 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the commission rules, the commission shall provide written
19 notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The notice must describe the default, the proposed
20 means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may take and must offer remedial
21 training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
22 (b) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from this
23 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights,
24 privileges and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may be terminated on the effective date of
25 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
26 the period of default.
27 (c) Termination of participation in this compact may be imposed only after all other means of
28 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 commission to the governor, to the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and to the
2 licensing board or boards of each of the participating states.
3 (d) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
4 incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
5 termination.
6 (e) The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
7 has been terminated from this compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
8 defaulting state.
9 (f) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the compact by the commission by
10 petitioning the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
11 principal offices. The prevailing member must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
12 attorney fees.
13 (g) Upon the termination of a state's participation in the compact, the state shall immediately
14 provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination:
15 (i) Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that state must retain the compact
16 privilege for 180 days following the effective date of such termination.
17 (ii) Licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted a compact privilege in a
18 participating state must retain the compact privilege for 180 days unless the licensee also has a qualifying
19 license in a participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating state before the 180-day period
20 ends, in which case the compact privilege must continue.
21 (3) Dispute resolution:
22 (a) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related
23 to this compact that arise among participating states and between participating and nonparticipating states.
24 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
25 resolution for disputes as appropriate.
26 (4) Enforcement:
27 (a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this
28 compact and rules of the commission.
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 (b) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance have been exhausted, by
2 majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action, in the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or
3 the federal district where the commission has its principal offices, against a participating state in default to
4 enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and the commission's promulgated rules and bylaws.
5 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
6 necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
7 (c) The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission
8 may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
9 (5) Legal action against the commission:
10 (a) A participating state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court
11 for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce
12 compliance with the provisions of the compact and its rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
13 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of
14 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
15 (b) No person other than a participating state may enforce this compact against the commission.
16 SECTION 11
17 DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PA LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION
18 (1) This compact comes into effect on the date on which this compact statute is enacted into law in
19 the seventh participating state.
20 (a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the
21 enactment of each of the states that enacted the compact prior to the commission convening ("charter
22 participating states") to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter participating state is materially
23 different than the model compact.
24 (i) A charter participating state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
25 compact is entitled to the default process set forth in section 10(2).
26 (ii) If any participating state later withdraws from the compact or its participation is terminated, the
27 commission remains in existence and the compact remains in effect even if the number of participating states is
28 fewer than seven. Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the commission convening are
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 subject to the process set forth in section 7(3)(u) to determine if their enactments are materially different from
2 the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
3 (b) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter participating
4 states are subject to the process set forth in section 7(3)(u) to determine if their enactments are materially
5 different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
6 (c) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the
7 administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
8 existence are considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission.
9 (2) Any state that joins this compact is subject to the commission's rules and bylaws as they exist
10 on the date on which this compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the
11 commission has the full force and effect of law on the day this compact becomes law in that state.
12 (3) Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the
13 same.
14 (a) A participating state's withdrawal does not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the
15 repealing statute. During this 180-day period, all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state
16 and were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state remain in effect. If any licensee licensed in the
17 withdrawing state is also licensed in another participating state or obtains a license in another participating state
18 within the 180 days, the licensee's compact privileges in other participating states may not be affected by the
19 passage of the 180 days.
20 (b) Withdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement of the state licensing board or boards of
21 the withdrawing state to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this
22 compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
23 (c) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this compact, the state shall
24 immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall
25 continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of
26 such notice of withdrawal.
27 (4) Nothing contained in this compact may be construed to invalidate or prevent any PA licensure
28 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between participating states and between a participating state
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 and nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
2 (5) This compact may be amended by the participating states. No amendment to this compact may
3 become effective and binding upon any participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner into
4 the laws of all participating states as determined by the commission.
5 SECTION 12
6 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
7 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed so as to
8 effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
9 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's
10 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
11 (2) The provisions of this compact are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision
12 of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating
13 state, of a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any
14 government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
15 the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency,
16 person, or circumstance is not affected thereby.
17 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) or this section, the commission may deny a state's participation
18 in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 10(2), terminate a participating state's
19 participation in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would
20 be with respect to a state seeking to participate in the compact, a material departure from the compact.
21 Otherwise, if this compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact
22 remains in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force and effect as to the
23 participating state affected as to all severable matters.
24 SECTION 13
25 BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT
26 (1) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a participating state that is not
27 inconsistent with this compact.
28 (2) Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this compact are superseded to the extent of the
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 conflict.
2 (3) All agreements between the commission and the participating states are binding in accordance
3 with their terms.
4
5 Section 2. Section 37-20-402, MCA, is amended to read:
6 "37-20-402. Criteria for licensing physician assistant -- criminal background checks. (1) A

13 SECTION 1
14 PURPOSE
15 In order to strengthen access to medical services, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of
16 medical services, the participating states of the PA licensure compact have allied in common purpose to
17 develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing authority of state licensing boards to license
18 and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the portability of a license to practice as a PA while safeguarding the
19 safety of patients. This compact allows medical services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual recognition of
20 the licensee's qualifying license by other compact participating states. This compact also adopts the prevailing
21 standard for PA licensure and affirms that the practice and delivery of medical services by the PA occurs where
22 the patient is located at the time of the patient encounter and therefore requires the PA to be under the
23 jurisdiction of the state licensing board where the patient is located. State licensing boards that participate in
24 this compact retain the jurisdiction to impose adverse action against a compact privilege in that state issued to
25 a PA through the procedures of this compact. The PA licensure compact will alleviate burdens for military
26 families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to obtain a compact privilege based on
27 having an unrestricted license in good standing from a participating state.

8 (a) identifying information;
9 (b) licensure data;

17 be available to other participating states.
18 (4) The commission shall promptly notify all participating states of any adverse action taken
19 against a licensee or an individual applying for a license that has been reported to it. This adverse action
20 information may be available to any other participating state.
21 (5) Participating states contributing information to the data system may, in accordance with state or
22 federal law, designate information that may not be shared with the public without the express permission of the

25 (6) Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently expunged pursuant to
26 federal law or the laws of the participating state contributing the information must be removed from the data

4 SECTION 9
5 RULEMAKING
6 (1) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this
7 section and the rules adopted thereunder. Commission rules are binding as of the date specified by the
8 commission for each rule.
9 (2) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
10 implement and administer this compact and achieve its purposes. A commission rule is invalid and does not
11 have force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the
12 commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this
13 compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
14 (3) The rules of the commission have the force of law in each participating state, provided however
15 that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the participating state that establish the medical
16 services a PA may perform in the participating state, as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of
17 the commission are ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
18 (4) If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a commission rule, by
19 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt this compact within 4 years of the date
20 of adoption of the rule, then such rule has no further force and effect in any participating state or to any state
21 applying to participate in the compact.
22 (5) Commission rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
23 (6) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission, and at least 30
24 days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a
25 notice of proposed rulemaking:
26 (a) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;
27 (b) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices of proposed rulemaking;
28 and
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 (c) in such other ways as the commission may by rule specify.
2 (7) The notice of proposed rulemaking must include:
3 (a) the time, date, and location of the public hearing on the proposed rule and the proposed time,
4 date, and location of the meeting in which the proposed rule will be considered and voted upon;
5 (b) the text of the proposed rule and the reason for the proposed rule;
6 (c) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person and the date by which
7 written comments must be received; and
8 (d) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the commission of their intention
9 to attend the public hearing or provide any written comments.
10 (8) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow persons to submit written data,
11 facts, opinions, and arguments, which must be made available to the public.
12 (9) If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the commission shall publish the mechanism
13 for access to the electronic hearing.
14 (a) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall, as directed in the notice of proposed
15 rulemaking, not less than 5 business days before the scheduled date of the hearing notify the commission of
16 their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.
17 (b) Hearings must be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair
18 and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.
19 (c) All hearings must be recorded. A copy of the recording and the written comments, data, facts,
20 opinions, and arguments received in response to the proposed rulemaking must be made available to a person
21 upon request.
22 (d) Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each proposed
23 rule. Proposed rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this
24 section.
25 (10) Following the public hearing, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments
26 timely received.
27 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all delegates, take final action on the proposed rule
28 and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if adopted, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183

69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 the rule.
2 (a) If adopted, the rule must be posted on the commission's website.
3 (b) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge
4 the original purpose of the proposed rule.
5 (c) The commission shall provide on its website an explanation of the reasons for substantive
6 changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
7 recommended by commenters.
8 (d) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
9 emergency as provided in subsection (12), the effective date of the rule must be no sooner than 30 days after
10 the commission issued the notice that it adopted the rule.
11 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
12 emergency rule with 24 hours' prior notice, without the opportunity for comment or hearing, provided that the
13 usual rulemaking procedures provided in this compact and in this section are retroactively applied to the rule as
14 soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes
15 of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately by the commission in order to:
16 (a) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
17 (b) prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds;
18 (c) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a commission rule that is established by federal law or
19 rule; or
20 (d) protect public health and safety.
21 (13) The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a
22 previously adopted commission rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in
23 consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions must be posted on the website of the
24 commission. The revision is subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The
25 revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge
26 must be made as set forth in the notice of revisions and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the
27 notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision takes effect without further action. If the revision is
28 challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.

1 (14) No participating state's rulemaking requirements may apply under this compact.
2 SECTION 10
3 OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
4 (1) Oversight:
5 (a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each participating state shall
6 enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
7 (b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission must be brought solely
8 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
9 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
10 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
11 in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
12 (c) The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
13 enforcement or interpretation of the compact or the commission's rules and shall have standing to intervene in
14 such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission with service of process renders a
15 judgment or order in such proceeding void as to the commission, this compact, or commission rules.
16 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:
17 (a) If the commission determines that a participating state has defaulted in the performance of its
18 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the commission rules, the commission shall provide written
19 notice to the defaulting state and other participating states. The notice must describe the default, the proposed
20 means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may take and must offer remedial
21 training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
22 (b) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from this
23 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the participating states, and all rights,
24 privileges and benefits conferred by this compact upon such state may be terminated on the effective date of
25 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
26 the period of default.
27 (c) Termination of participation in this compact may be imposed only after all other means of
28 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 commission to the governor, to the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and to the
2 licensing board or boards of each of the participating states.
3 (d) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
4 incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
5 termination.
6 (e) The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
7 has been terminated from this compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
8 defaulting state.
9 (f) The defaulting state may appeal its termination from the compact by the commission by
10 petitioning the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
11 principal offices. The prevailing member must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
12 attorney fees.
13 (g) Upon the termination of a state's participation in the compact, the state shall immediately
14 provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination:
15 (i) Licensees who have been granted a compact privilege in that state must retain the compact
16 privilege for 180 days following the effective date of such termination.
17 (ii) Licensees who are licensed in that state who have been granted a compact privilege in a
18 participating state must retain the compact privilege for 180 days unless the licensee also has a qualifying
19 license in a participating state or obtains a qualifying license in a participating state before the 180-day period
20 ends, in which case the compact privilege must continue.
21 (3) Dispute resolution:
22 (a) Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related
23 to this compact that arise among participating states and between participating and nonparticipating states.
24 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
25 resolution for disputes as appropriate.
26 (4) Enforcement:
27 (a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this
28 compact and rules of the commission.
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 (b) If compliance is not secured after all means to secure compliance have been exhausted, by
2 majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action, in the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or
3 the federal district where the commission has its principal offices, against a participating state in default to
4 enforce compliance with the provisions of this compact and the commission's promulgated rules and bylaws.
5 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
6 necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
7 (c) The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission
8 may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.
9 (5) Legal action against the commission:
10 (a) A participating state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court
11 for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce
12 compliance with the provisions of the compact and its rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
13 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of
14 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
15 (b) No person other than a participating state may enforce this compact against the commission.
16 SECTION 11
17 DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PA LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION
18 (1) This compact comes into effect on the date on which this compact statute is enacted into law in
19 the seventh participating state.
20 (a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the
21 enactment of each of the states that enacted the compact prior to the commission convening ("charter
22 participating states") to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter participating state is materially
23 different than the model compact.
24 (i) A charter participating state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
25 compact is entitled to the default process set forth in section 10(2).
26 (ii) If any participating state later withdraws from the compact or its participation is terminated, the
27 commission remains in existence and the compact remains in effect even if the number of participating states is
28 fewer than seven. Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the commission convening are
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 subject to the process set forth in section 7(3)(u) to determine if their enactments are materially different from
2 the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
3 (b) Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter participating
4 states are subject to the process set forth in section 7(3)(u) to determine if their enactments are materially
5 different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
6 (c) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the
7 administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
8 existence are considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission.
9 (2) Any state that joins this compact is subject to the commission's rules and bylaws as they exist
10 on the date on which this compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the
11 commission has the full force and effect of law on the day this compact becomes law in that state.
12 (3) Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the
13 same.
14 (a) A participating state's withdrawal does not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the
15 repealing statute. During this 180-day period, all compact privileges that were in effect in the withdrawing state
16 and were granted to licensees licensed in the withdrawing state remain in effect. If any licensee licensed in the
17 withdrawing state is also licensed in another participating state or obtains a license in another participating state
18 within the 180 days, the licensee's compact privileges in other participating states may not be affected by the
19 passage of the 180 days.
20 (b) Withdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement of the state licensing board or boards of
21 the withdrawing state to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this
22 compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
23 (c) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a state from this compact, the state shall
24 immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Such withdrawing state shall
25 continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of
26 such notice of withdrawal.
27 (4) Nothing contained in this compact may be construed to invalidate or prevent any PA licensure
28 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between participating states and between a participating state
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 183.1
1 and nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.
2 (5) This compact may be amended by the participating states. No amendment to this compact may
3 become effective and binding upon any participating state until it is enacted materially in the same manner into
4 the laws of all participating states as determined by the commission.
5 SECTION 12
6 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
7 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed so as to
8 effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
9 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's
10 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
11 (2) The provisions of this compact are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision
12 of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating
13 state, of a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any
14 government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
15 the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency,
16 person, or circumstance is not affected thereby.
17 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) or this section, the commission may deny a state's participation
18 in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 10(2), terminate a participating state's
19 participation in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a participating state is, or would
20 be with respect to a state seeking to participate in the compact, a material departure from the compact.
21 Otherwise, if this compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact
22 remains in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force and effect as to the
23 participating state affected as to all severable matters.
24 SECTION 13
25 BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT
26 (1) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a participating state that is not
27 inconsistent with this compact.
28 (2) Any laws in a participating state in conflict with this compact are superseded to the extent of the
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – HB 183

1 conflict.
2 (3) All agreements between the commission and the participating states are binding in accordance
3 with their terms.
