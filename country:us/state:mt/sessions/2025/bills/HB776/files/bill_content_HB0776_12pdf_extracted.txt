9 notice relieves the landlord of the requirement of giving notice and allows the landlord to deduct the cleaning
10 charges from the deposit, or the landlord may leave a copy of the notice in a conspicuous location in the rental

19 expiration of the month. The notice, when served upon the tenant, shall of itself operate and be effectual to
20 create and establish as a part of the lease the terms, rent, and conditions specified in the notice if the tenant
21 shall continue to hold the premises after the expiration of the month.
22 (2) In a month-to-month tenancy that was entered into after the expiration of an original lease
23 agreement of 1 year or longer with a property management company, the landlord may change the terms of the
24 lease after giving in writing at least 90 days' notice before the date specified in the notice."

2 Section 5. Section 70-24-441, MCA, is amended to read:
3 "70-24-441. Termination by landlord or tenant. (1) The landlord or the tenant may terminate a
4 week-to-week tenancy by a written notice given to the other at least 7 days before the termination date
5 specified in the notice.
6 (2) The Notwithstanding subsection (3)(a), the landlord or the tenant may terminate a month-to-
7 month tenancy by giving to the other at any time during the tenancy at least 30 days' notice in writing prior to
8 the date designated in the notice for the termination of the tenancy.

11 notice given to the tenant at least 90 days before the termination date specified in the notice.
12 (b) The tenant may terminate a month-to-month tenancy that was entered into after the expiration
13 of an original lease agreement of 1 year or longer with a property management company by a written notice
14 given to the landlord at least 30 days before the termination date specified in the notice.
15 (3)(4) The tenancy terminates on the date designated and without regard to the expiration of the

19 Section 6. Section 70-25-201, MCA, is amended to read:
20 "70-25-201. Security deposit -- deductions authorized therefrom. (1) A landlord renting property
21 covered by this chapter may deduct from the security deposit a sum equal to the damage alleged to have been
22 caused by the tenant, together with a sum equal to the unpaid rent, late charges, utilities, penalties due under
23 lease provisions, and other money owing to the landlord at the time of deduction, including rent owed under 70-
24 24-441(3)(4), and a sum for actual cleaning expenses, including a reasonable charge for the landlord's labor.

1 forced to perform this maintenance because of negligence of the tenant. Additionally, cleaning charges may not
2 be deducted until written notice has been given to the tenant. The notice must include the cleaning not
3 accomplished by the tenant and the additional and type or types of cleaning that need to be done by the tenant
4 to bring the premises back to its condition at the time of its renting. After the delivery of the notice, the tenant
5 has 24 hours to complete the required cleaning, unless the rental agreement is already terminated pursuant to
6 70-24-427 or 70-33-427 and the landlord has a pending claim for actual damages filed in court. If notice is
7 mailed by certified mail, service of the notice is considered to have been made 3 days after the date of the
8 mailing. A tenant who fails to notify the landlord of the intent to vacate or who vacates the premises without
9 notice relieves the landlord of the requirement of giving notice and allows the landlord to deduct the cleaning
10 charges from the deposit, or the landlord may leave a copy of the notice in a conspicuous location in the rental
11 unit and notify the tenant by e-mail, phone, or text, and notice is considered delivered.
12 (4) A person may not deduct or withhold from the security deposit any amount for purposes other

18 writing at least 15 days before the expiration of the month, change the terms of the lease to take effect at the
19 expiration of the month. The notice, when served upon the tenant, shall of itself operate and be effectual to
20 create and establish as a part of the lease the terms, rent, and conditions specified in the notice if the tenant
21 shall continue to hold the premises after the expiration of the month.
22 (2) In a month-to-month tenancy that was entered into after the expiration of an original lease
23 agreement of 1 year or longer with a property management company, the landlord may change the terms of the
24 lease after giving in writing at least 90 days' notice before the date specified in the notice."
