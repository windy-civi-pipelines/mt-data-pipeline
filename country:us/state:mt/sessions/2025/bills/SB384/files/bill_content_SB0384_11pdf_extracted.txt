4 the county attorney in the jurisdiction in which the alleged crime occurred, the department may not report
5 pursuant to 41-3-205(5)(d) and subsection (1)(b)(i) of this section.
6 (iii) If the department or law enforcement determines that the allegation involves the county
7 attorney or an employee in the county attorney's office in the county in which the acts that are subject to
8 reporting occurred, the department or law enforcement shall report as required in subsection (1)(b)(i) to the
9 attorney general.
10 (c) If the department determines that an investigation and a safety and risk assessment are
11 required, a child protection specialist shall promptly conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances
12 surrounding the allegations of abuse or neglect of the child and perform a safety and risk assessment to

15 facility, or any other place where the child is present and into all other nonfinancial matters that in the discretion
16 of the investigator are relevant to the safety and risk assessment. In conducting a safety and risk assessment
17 under this section, a child protection specialist may not inquire into the financial status of the child's family or of
18 any other person responsible for the child's care, except as necessary to ascertain eligibility for state or federal
19 assistance programs or to comply with the provisions of 41-3-446.
20 (2) An initial investigation of alleged abuse or neglect may be conducted when an anonymous
21 report is received. However, if the initial investigation does not within 48 hours result in the development of
22 independent, corroborative, and attributable information indicating that there exists a current risk of physical or
23 psychological harm to the child, a child may not be removed from the living arrangement. If independent,
24 corroborative, and attributable information indicating an ongoing risk results from the initial investigation, the
25 department shall then conduct a safety and risk assessment.

27 the child is treated at a medical facility, the child protection specialist, county attorney, or peace officer,
28 consistent with reasonable medical practice, has the right of access to the child for interviews, photographs,

3 or peace officer may conduct an interview of the child. The interview may be conducted in the presence of the
4 parent or guardian or an employee of the school or day-care facility attended by the child.
5 (4) Subject to 41-3-205(3), if the child's interview is audiotaped or videotaped, an unedited
6 audiotape or videotape with audio track must be made available, upon request, for unencumbered review by
7 the family.
8 (5) (a) If from the safety and risk assessment the department has reasonable cause to suspect that
9 the child is suffering abuse or neglect, the department may provide emergency protective services to the child,
10 pursuant to 41-3-301, place the child in a protective placement for reasons of temporary hardship pursuant to
11 [section 1], or enter into a written prevention plan, pursuant to 41-3-302, and may provide protective services to
12 any other child under the same care. The department shall:
13 (i) after interviewing the parent or guardian, if reasonably available, document the determinations
14 of the safety and risk assessment; and
15 (ii) notify the child's family of the determinations of the safety and risk assessment, unless the
16 notification can reasonably be expected to result in harm to the child or other person.

18 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of

24 safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or
25 (iii) an order has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the child as a youth
26 in need of care based on the circumstances surrounding the initial allegations.

1 hydration, or medication, to an infant when, in the treating physician's or physicians' reasonable medical
2 judgment:
3 (i) the infant is chronically and irreversibly comatose;
4 (ii) the provision of treatment would:
5 (A) merely prolong dying;
6 (B) not be effective in ameliorating or correcting all of the infant's life-threatening conditions; or
7 (C) otherwise be futile in terms of the survival of the infant; or
8 (iii) the provision of treatment would be virtually futile in terms of the survival of the infant and the
9 treatment itself under the circumstances would be inhumane. For purposes of this subsection (35), "infant"
10 means an infant less than 1 year of age or an infant 1 year of age or older who has been continuously
11 hospitalized since birth, who was born extremely prematurely, or who has a long-term disability. The reference
12 to less than 1 year of age may not be construed to imply that treatment should be changed or discontinued
13 when an infant reaches 1 year of age or to affect or limit any existing protections available under state laws
14 regarding medical neglect of children 1 year of age or older.
15 (36) "Youth in need of care" means a youth who has been adjudicated or determined, after a
16 hearing, to be or to have been abused, neglected, or abandoned."

20 neglected, the department shall promptly assess the information contained in the report and make a
21 determination regarding the level of response required and the timeframe within which action must be initiated.
22 (b) (i) Except as provided in subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (1)(b)(iii), upon receipt of a report that
23 includes an allegation of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation when the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse
24 or sexual exploitation was 12 years of age or older or if the department determines during any investigation that
25 the circumstances surrounding an allegation of child abuse or neglect include an allegation of sexual abuse or
26 sexual exploitation when the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation was 12 years of age
27 or older, the department shall immediately report the allegation to the county attorney of the county in which the
28 acts that are the subject of the report occurred.

69th Legislature 2025 SB 384.1
1 (ii) If a victim of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation has attained the age of 14 and has sought
2 services from a contractor as described in 41-3-201(2)(j) that provides confidential services to victims of sexual
3 assault, conditioned upon an understanding that the criminal conduct will not be reported by the department to
4 the county attorney in the jurisdiction in which the alleged crime occurred, the department may not report
5 pursuant to 41-3-205(5)(d) and subsection (1)(b)(i) of this section.
6 (iii) If the department or law enforcement determines that the allegation involves the county
7 attorney or an employee in the county attorney's office in the county in which the acts that are subject to
8 reporting occurred, the department or law enforcement shall report as required in subsection (1)(b)(i) to the
9 attorney general.
10 (c) If the department determines that an investigation and a safety and risk assessment are
11 required, a child protection specialist shall promptly conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances
12 surrounding the allegations of abuse or neglect of the child and perform a safety and risk assessment to
13 determine whether the living arrangement presents an unsafe environment for the child. The safety and risk
14 assessment may include an investigation at the home of the child involved, the child's school or day-care
15 facility, or any other place where the child is present and into all other nonfinancial matters that in the discretion
16 of the investigator are relevant to the safety and risk assessment. In conducting a safety and risk assessment
17 under this section, a child protection specialist may not inquire into the financial status of the child's family or of
18 any other person responsible for the child's care, except as necessary to ascertain eligibility for state or federal
19 assistance programs or to comply with the provisions of 41-3-446.
20 (2) An initial investigation of alleged abuse or neglect may be conducted when an anonymous
21 report is received. However, if the initial investigation does not within 48 hours result in the development of
22 independent, corroborative, and attributable information indicating that there exists a current risk of physical or
23 psychological harm to the child, a child may not be removed from the living arrangement. If independent,
24 corroborative, and attributable information indicating an ongoing risk results from the initial investigation, the
25 department shall then conduct a safety and risk assessment.
26 (3) The child protection specialist is responsible for conducting the safety and risk assessment. If
27 the child is treated at a medical facility, the child protection specialist, county attorney, or peace officer,
28 consistent with reasonable medical practice, has the right of access to the child for interviews, photographs,

2 to the child. If an interview of the child is considered necessary, the child protection specialist, county attorney,
3 or peace officer may conduct an interview of the child. The interview may be conducted in the presence of the
4 parent or guardian or an employee of the school or day-care facility attended by the child.
5 (4) Subject to 41-3-205(3), if the child's interview is audiotaped or videotaped, an unedited
6 audiotape or videotape with audio track must be made available, upon request, for unencumbered review by
7 the family.
8 (5) (a) If from the safety and risk assessment the department has reasonable cause to suspect that
9 the child is suffering abuse or neglect, the department may provide emergency protective services to the child,
10 pursuant to 41-3-301, place the child in a protective placement for reasons of temporary hardship pursuant to
11 [section 1], or enter into a written prevention plan, pursuant to 41-3-302, and may provide protective services to
12 any other child under the same care. The department shall:
13 (i) after interviewing the parent or guardian, if reasonably available, document the determinations
14 of the safety and risk assessment; and
15 (ii) notify the child's family of the determinations of the safety and risk assessment, unless the
16 notification can reasonably be expected to result in harm to the child or other person.
17 (b) Except as provided in subsection (5)(c), the department shall destroy all safety and risk
18 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of
19 the 3-year period starting from the date of completion of the safety and risk assessment.

21 reasonable time as defined by department rule under the following circumstances:
22 (i) the safety and risk assessment determines that abuse or neglect occurred;
23 (ii) there had been a previous or there is a subsequent report and investigation resulting in a
24 safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or
25 (iii) an order has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the child as a youth
26 in need of care based on the circumstances surrounding the initial allegations.
27 (6) The investigating child protection specialist, within 60 days of commencing an investigation,
28 shall also furnish a written safety and risk assessment to the department and, upon request, to the family.

4 assessment, including case notes, correspondence, evaluations, videotapes, and interviews, for 25 years.
5 (7) Any person reporting abuse or neglect that involves acts or omissions on the part of a public or
6 private residential institution, home, facility, or agency is responsible for ensuring that the report is made to the
