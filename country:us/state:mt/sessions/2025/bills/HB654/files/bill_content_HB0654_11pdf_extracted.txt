69th Legislature 2025 HB 654.1
1 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
2 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
3 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
4 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-
5 related days may be included in the calculation.
6 (3) When a school district has approval to operate less than the minimum aggregate hours under
7 20-9-806, the total ANB must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of 20-9-805.
8 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), for the purpose of calculating ANB, enrollment in
9 an education program:
10 (i) from 180 to 359 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as one-quarter-
11 time enrollment;

20 travel, that would result in an unusual hardship to the pupils of the school if they were transported to another
21 school, the number of regularly enrolled pupils of the school must be calculated separately for ANB purposes
22 and the district must receive a basic entitlement for the school calculated separately from the other schools of
23 the district; or
24 (iv) two or more districts consolidate or annex under the provisions of 20-6-422 or 20-6-423, the

15 school attendance, absence, and enrollment for regularly enrolled students, using a format determined by the
16 superintendent.

4 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-
5 related days may be included in the calculation.

21 school, the number of regularly enrolled pupils of the school must be calculated separately for ANB purposes
22 and the district must receive a basic entitlement for the school calculated separately from the other schools of
23 the district; or
