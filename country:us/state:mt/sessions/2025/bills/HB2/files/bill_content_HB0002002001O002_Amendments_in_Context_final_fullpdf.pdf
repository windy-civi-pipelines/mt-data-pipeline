11 State agencies and universities will be billed half the insurance premium in the 2027 biennium by the Risk Management and Tort Defense Division (RMTD) due to an overage in the state insurance fund’s reserves.
12 Any insurance premium discounts that would have been realized in the 2027 biennium through participation in RMTD’s risk management/loss mitigation programs must be applied from each state agency’s or university’s
13 insurance premium holiday savings in a reasonable manner to avoid programmatic and funding shortfalls. RMTD has the authority to bill state agencies and universities an increased insurance premium if the agency or
14 university does not participate in risk management/loss mitigation activities during the 2027 biennium.
15 It is the intent of the Legislature that the Risk Management and Tort Defense Division’s proprietary fund partial rate holiday be one-time-only, and the full rate amount will be included in the 2029 biennium’s base
