5 17-7-138(2), MCA. The Board of Regents shall allocate the appropriations to individual university system units, as defined in section 17-7-102(15), MCA, according to board policy.
6 The Montana University System, except for the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education and the community colleges, shall provide the Office of Budget and Program Planning and the Legislative Fiscal
7 Division Banner access to the entire university system's information system, except for information pertaining to individual students and individual employees that is protected by Article II, sections 9 and 10, of the Montana
8 Constitution, section 20-25-515, MCA, or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. 1232g.

16 FTE adjustment account. If actual weighted resident FTE student enrollment is less than the estimated numbers for the biennium, the community colleges shall pay a fee equal to the overpayment amount to be deposited
17 in the FTE adjustment account in accordance with section 20-15-328, MCA.
