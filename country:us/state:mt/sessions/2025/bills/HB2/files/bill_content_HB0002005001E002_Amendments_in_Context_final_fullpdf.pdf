12 The commissioner may adjust the funding distribution between community colleges based on actual weighted FTE enrollment.
13 The community college FTE decrease funding factor is $6,000 for FY 2026 and $6,000 for FY 2027. The community college FTE increase funding factor is $8,000 for FY 2026 and $8,000 for FY 2027. The community
14 college weighting factors for the 2027 biennium are 1.50 for CTE FTE, 1.00 for general education FTE, 0.50 for early college FTE, and 0.25 for concurrent enrollment FTE.
15 The community college FTE decrease funding factor is $3,125 for FY 2026 and $3,125 for FY 2027. The community college FTE increase funding factor is $6,500 for FY 2026 and $6,500 for FY 2027. The community
16 college weighting factors for the 2027 biennium are 1.50 for CTE FTE, 1.35 for general education FTE, 0.50 for early college FTE, and 0.25 for concurrent enrollment FTE.
17 EXPLANATION: This portion of the amendment changes the FTE funding factor and weights to the amounts that were proposed with the executive’s budget.
18 The general fund appropriation for Community College Assistance is calculated to fund education in the community colleges for an estimated 1,911 resident FTE in FY 2026 and 1,996 in FY 2027. If actual weighted
19 resident FTE student enrollment in the community colleges is greater than the estimated number for the biennium, the community colleges must receive a reimbursement for the underpayment from the community college
20 FTE adjustment account. If actual weighted resident FTE student enrollment is less than the estimated numbers for the biennium, the community colleges shall pay a fee equal to the overpayment amount to be deposited
21 in the FTE adjustment account in accordance with section 20-15-328, MCA.
22 Total audit costs are estimated to be $358,500 for the community colleges for the biennium. Audit costs charged to the community colleges for the biennium may not exceed $60,500 for Flathead Valley Community
23 College, $188,000 for Miles Community College, and $110,000 for Dawson Community College. Total audit costs for UM - Missoula is $549,653 and MSU - Bozeman is $542,668.
