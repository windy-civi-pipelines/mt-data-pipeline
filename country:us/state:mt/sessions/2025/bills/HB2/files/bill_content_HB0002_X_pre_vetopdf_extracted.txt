All appropriations for the Legislative Branch are biennial.
It is the intent of the Legislature that Pension Actuarial not be included in the Legislative Fiscal Division’s budget request for the 2029 biennium.
Audit and Examination includes a one-time-only reduction of general fund of $469,568 in FY 2026 and $477,759 in FY 2027 and increase of state special revenue of $469,568 in FY 2026 and $477,759 in FY 2027
because of an anticipated temporary increase in the number of hours to complete the Federal Single Audit.
Audit and Examination includes a one-time-only increase of general fund of $132,165 in FY 2026 and $132,165 in FY 2027 and decrease of state special revenue of $132,165 in FY 2026 and $132,165 in FY 2027
because of proposed changes in information technology audits included in LC 4208. If LC 4208 is not passed and approved, then the increase in general fund and the decrease in state special revenue in FY 2026 and
FY 2027 is void.
The general fund appropriations in FY 2026 and FY 2027 for Hotline Cases and Other Contingencies are for contracted services necessary under section 5-13-305, MCA, relating to increased activities for hotline
cases and other contingencies.
Analysis of Montana Budget Implications From Federal Action is contingent on one of the following events occurring in either fiscal year of the 2027 biennium: (1) passage of a bill or other type of legislation from
either chamber of Congress or executive order that reduces anticipated federal revenues to Montana by more than $100 million in the 2027 biennium; (2) passage of a bill or other type of legislation by both chambers of
Congress or executive order that cancels previously enacted spending in a manner that reduces anticipated federal revenues to Montana by more than $50 million; or (3) passage of a bill or other type of legislation from
either chamber of Congress that reduces anticipated state general fund revenue by more than $100 million. This appropriation will be used for additional Legislative Finance Committee meetings and joint meetings with
appropriate interim committees and interim budget committees to analyze and prepare for changes to the Montana budget resulting from federal action.
If HB 100 is passed and approved, the Legislative Branch is increased by $116,855 general fund in FY 2027, and the Legislative Branch may increase positions budgeted authorized in HB 2 by 1.00 PB in FY 2027.
If HB 111 is passed and approved, the Legislative Branch is increased by $66,150 general fund in FY 2026 and $28,350 general fund in FY 2027.

The commissioner may adjust the funding distribution between community colleges based on actual weighted FTE enrollment.
The community college FTE decrease funding factor is $6,000 for FY 2026 and $6,000 for FY 2027. The community college FTE increase funding factor is $8,000 for FY 2026 and $8,000 for FY 2027. The community
college weighting factors for the 2027 biennium are 1.50 for CTE FTE, 1.00 for general education FTE, 0.50 for early college FTE, and 0.25 for concurrent enrollment FTE.
The general fund appropriation for Community College Assistance is calculated to fund education in the community colleges for an estimated 1,911 resident FTE in FY 2026 and 1,996 in FY 2027. If actual weighted
resident FTE student enrollment in the community colleges is greater than the estimated number for the biennium, the community colleges must receive a reimbursement for the underpayment from the community college
FTE adjustment account. If actual weighted resident FTE student enrollment is less than the estimated numbers for the biennium, the community colleges shall pay a fee equal to the overpayment amount to be deposited
in the FTE adjustment account in accordance with section 20-15-328, MCA.
Total audit costs are estimated to be $358,500 for the community colleges for the biennium. Audit costs charged to the community colleges for the biennium may not exceed $60,500 for Flathead Valley Community
College, $188,000 for Miles Community College, and $110,000 for Dawson Community College. Total audit costs for UM - Missoula is $549,653 and MSU - Bozeman is $542,668.
If HB 864 is not passed and approved, the appropriation for Non-Beneficiary Increase is void.

State agencies and universities will be billed half the insurance premium in the 2027 biennium by the Risk Management and Tort Defense Division (RMTD) due to an overage in the state insurance fund’s reserves.
Any insurance premium discounts that would have been realized in the 2027 biennium through participation in RMTD’s risk management/loss mitigation programs must be applied from each state agency’s or university’s
insurance premium holiday savings in a reasonable manner to avoid programmatic and funding shortfalls. RMTD has the authority to bill state agencies and universities an increased insurance premium if the agency or
university does not participate in risk management/loss mitigation activities during the 2027 biennium.
It is the intent of the Legislature that the Risk Management and Tort Defense Division’s proprietary fund partial rate holiday be one-time-only, and the full rate amount will be included in the 2029 biennium’s base

69th Legislature HB 2
A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT APPROPRIATING MONEY TO VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES FOR THE BIENNIUM ENDING JUNE 30, 2027; AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.”
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
Section 1. Short title. [This act] may be cited as "The General Appropriations Act of 2025".
Section 2. First level expenditures. The agency and program appropriation tables in the legislative fiscal analyst narrative accompanying this bill, showing first level expenditures and funding for the 2027
biennium, are adopted as legislative intent.
Section 3. Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of [this act] is for any reason held unconstitutional, the decision does not affect the validity of the remaining portions of [this act].
Section 4. Appropriation control. An appropriation item designated "Biennial" may be spent in either year of the biennium. An appropriation item designated "Restricted" may be used during the biennium only
for the purpose designated by its title and as presented to the Legislature. An appropriation item designated "One Time Only" or "OTO" may not be included in the present law base for the 2029 biennium. The Office of
Budget and Program Planning shall establish a separate appropriation on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system for any item designated "Biennial", "Restricted", "One Time Only", or "OTO".
The Office of Budget and Program Planning shall establish at least one appropriation on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system for any appropriation that appears as a separate line item in
[this act].
Section 5. Appropriation control. The Office of Budget and Program Planning shall establish a separate appropriation on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system for the funding
included in each Executive Branch agency's budget to pay fixed cost allocations for the State Information Technology Services Division of the Department of Administration. The appropriations must be designated as
restricted.
Section 6. Appropriation control. For any appropriation for the Legislative Audit Division Federal Single Audit contained in [this act], the Office of Budget and Program Planning is authorized to move the
appropriation between agencies. Movement of appropriation authority must be based on actual audit hours worked by legislative auditors on the Federal Single Audit for any specific agency. The “Restricted” and “Biennial”
designation must be retained on all appropriations for the Legislative Audit Division Federal Single Audit.
Section 7. Program definition. As used in [this act], "program":

All appropriations for the Legislative Branch are biennial.
It is the intent of the Legislature that Pension Actuarial not be included in the Legislative Fiscal Division’s budget request for the 2029 biennium.
Audit and Examination includes a one-time-only reduction of general fund of $469,568 in FY 2026 and $477,759 in FY 2027 and increase of state special revenue of $469,568 in FY 2026 and $477,759 in FY 2027
because of an anticipated temporary increase in the number of hours to complete the Federal Single Audit.
Audit and Examination includes a one-time-only increase of general fund of $132,165 in FY 2026 and $132,165 in FY 2027 and decrease of state special revenue of $132,165 in FY 2026 and $132,165 in FY 2027
because of proposed changes in information technology audits included in LC 4208. If LC 4208 is not passed and approved, then the increase in general fund and the decrease in state special revenue in FY 2026 and
FY 2027 is void.
The general fund appropriations in FY 2026 and FY 2027 for Hotline Cases and Other Contingencies are for contracted services necessary under section 5-13-305, MCA, relating to increased activities for hotline
cases and other contingencies.
Analysis of Montana Budget Implications From Federal Action is contingent on one of the following events occurring in either fiscal year of the 2027 biennium: (1) passage of a bill or other type of legislation from
either chamber of Congress or executive order that reduces anticipated federal revenues to Montana by more than $100 million in the 2027 biennium; (2) passage of a bill or other type of legislation by both chambers of
Congress or executive order that cancels previously enacted spending in a manner that reduces anticipated federal revenues to Montana by more than $50 million; or (3) passage of a bill or other type of legislation from
either chamber of Congress that reduces anticipated state general fund revenue by more than $100 million. This appropriation will be used for additional Legislative Finance Committee meetings and joint meetings with
appropriate interim committees and interim budget committees to analyze and prepare for changes to the Montana budget resulting from federal action.
If HB 100 is passed and approved, the Legislative Branch is increased by $116,855 general fund in FY 2027, and the Legislative Branch may increase positions budgeted authorized in HB 2 by 1.00 PB in FY 2027.
If HB 111 is passed and approved, the Legislative Branch is increased by $66,150 general fund in FY 2026 and $28,350 general fund in FY 2027.

The commissioner may adjust the funding distribution between community colleges based on actual weighted FTE enrollment.
The community college FTE decrease funding factor is $6,000 for FY 2026 and $6,000 for FY 2027. The community college FTE increase funding factor is $8,000 for FY 2026 and $8,000 for FY 2027. The community
college weighting factors for the 2027 biennium are 1.50 for CTE FTE, 1.00 for general education FTE, 0.50 for early college FTE, and 0.25 for concurrent enrollment FTE.
The general fund appropriation for Community College Assistance is calculated to fund education in the community colleges for an estimated 1,911 resident FTE in FY 2026 and 1,996 in FY 2027. If actual weighted
resident FTE student enrollment in the community colleges is greater than the estimated number for the biennium, the community colleges must receive a reimbursement for the underpayment from the community college
FTE adjustment account. If actual weighted resident FTE student enrollment is less than the estimated numbers for the biennium, the community colleges shall pay a fee equal to the overpayment amount to be deposited
in the FTE adjustment account in accordance with section 20-15-328, MCA.
Total audit costs are estimated to be $358,500 for the community colleges for the biennium. Audit costs charged to the community colleges for the biennium may not exceed $60,500 for Flathead Valley Community
College, $188,000 for Miles Community College, and $110,000 for Dawson Community College. Total audit costs for UM - Missoula is $549,653 and MSU - Bozeman is $542,668.

State agencies and universities will be billed half the insurance premium in the 2027 biennium by the Risk Management and Tort Defense Division (RMTD) due to an overage in the state insurance fund’s reserves.
Any insurance premium discounts that would have been realized in the 2027 biennium through participation in RMTD’s risk management/loss mitigation programs must be applied from each state agency’s or university’s
insurance premium holiday savings in a reasonable manner to avoid programmatic and funding shortfalls. RMTD has the authority to bill state agencies and universities an increased insurance premium if the agency or
university does not participate in risk management/loss mitigation activities during the 2027 biennium.
It is the intent of the Legislature that the Risk Management and Tort Defense Division’s proprietary fund partial rate holiday be one-time-only, and the full rate amount will be included in the 2029 biennium’s base
budget.
