2 by units of the Montana University System (other than plant funds appropriated in HB 5 relating to long-range building) are appropriated to the Board of Regents and may be expended under the provisions of section
3 17-7-138(2), MCA. The Board of Regents shall allocate the appropriations to individual university system units, as defined in section 17-7-102(15), MCA, according to board policy.
4 The Montana University System, except for the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education and the community colleges, shall provide the Office of Budget and Program Planning and the Legislative Fiscal
5 Division Banner access to the entire university system's information system, except for information pertaining to individual students and individual employees that is protected by Article II, sections 9 and 10, of the Montana
6 Constitution, section 20-25-515, MCA, or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. 1232g.
7 The Montana University System shall provide the electronic data required for entering human resource data for the current unrestricted operating funds into the internet budgeting and reporting system. The salary

9 The commissioner may adjust the funding distribution between community colleges based on actual weighted FTE enrollment.
10 The community college FTE decrease funding factor is $6,000 for FY 2026 and $6,000 for FY 2027. The community college FTE increase funding factor is $8,000 for FY 2026 and $8,000 for FY 2027. The community

12 The general fund appropriation for Community College Assistance is calculated to fund education in the community colleges for an estimated 1,911 resident FTE in FY 2026 and 1,996 in FY 2027. If actual weighted
13 resident FTE student enrollment in the community colleges is greater than the estimated number for the biennium, the community colleges must receive a reimbursement for the underpayment from the community college
14 FTE adjustment account. If actual weighted resident FTE student enrollment is less than the estimated numbers for the biennium, the community colleges shall pay a fee equal to the overpayment amount to be deposited
15 in the FTE adjustment account in accordance with section 20-15-328, MCA.
16 Total audit costs are estimated to be $358,500 for the community colleges for the biennium. Audit costs charged to the community colleges for the biennium may not exceed $60,500 for Flathead Valley Community
