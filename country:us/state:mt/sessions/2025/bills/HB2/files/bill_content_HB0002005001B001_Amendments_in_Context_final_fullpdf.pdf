5 EXPLANATION: This amendment assumes that community engagement requirements are approved on the federal level and adjusts the Health Resources Division caseload accordingly. A delay in waiver is assumed,
6 so the authority reduction only takes place in FY 2027. The amendment decreases in FY 2027 by $3,257,098 general fund and $29,313,885 federal special revenue funds.
