10 All appropriations for the Legislative Branch are biennial.
11 It is the intent of the Legislature that Pension Actuarial not be included in the Legislative Fiscal Division’s budget request for the 2029 biennium.
12 Audit and Examination includes a one-time-only reduction of general fund of $469,568 in FY 2026 and $477,759 in FY 2027 and increase of state special revenue of $469,568 in FY 2026 and $477,759 in FY 2027
13 because of an anticipated temporary increase in the number of hours to complete the Federal Single Audit.
14 Audit and Examination includes a one-time-only increase of general fund of $132,165 in FY 2026 and $132,165 in FY 2027 and decrease of state special revenue of $132,165 in FY 2026 and $132,165 in FY 2027
15 because of proposed changes in information technology audits included in LC 4208. If LC 4208 is not passed and approved, then the increase in general fund and the decrease in state special revenue in FY 2026 and
16 FY 2027 is void.
17 The general fund appropriations in FY 2026 and FY 2027 for Hotline Cases and Other Contingencies are for contracted services necessary under section 5-13-305, MCA, relating to increased activities for hotline
18 cases and other contingencies.
19 Analysis of Montana Budget Implications From Federal Action is contingent on one of the following events occurring in either fiscal year of the 2027 biennium: (1) passage of a bill or other type of legislation from
20 either chamber of Congress or executive order that reduces anticipated federal revenues to Montana by more than $100 million in the 2027 biennium; (2) passage of a bill or other type of legislation by both chambers of
21 Congress or executive order that cancels previously enacted spending in a manner that reduces anticipated federal revenues to Montana by more than $50 million; or (3) passage of a bill or other type of legislation from
