2 Items designated as OCHE Administration Program, Student Assistance Program, Educational Outreach and Diversity, Workforce Development Program, Appropriation Distribution, Guaranteed Student Loan, and
3 Board of Regents Administration are designated as biennial appropriations.
4 General fund money, state and federal special revenue, and proprietary fund revenue appropriated to the Board of Regents are included in all Montana University System programs. All other public funds received
5 by units of the Montana University System (other than plant funds appropriated in HB 5 relating to long-range building) are appropriated to the Board of Regents and may be expended under the provisions of section
6 17-7-138(2), MCA. The Board of Regents shall allocate the appropriations to individual university system units, as defined in section 17-7-102(15), MCA, according to board policy.
7 The Montana University System, except for the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education and the community colleges, shall provide the Office of Budget and Program Planning and the Legislative Fiscal
8 Division Banner access to the entire university system's information system, except for information pertaining to individual students and individual employees that is protected by Article II, sections 9 and 10, of the Montana
9 Constitution, section 20-25-515, MCA, or the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. 1232g.
10 The Montana University System shall provide the electronic data required for entering human resource data for the current unrestricted operating funds into the internet budgeting and reporting system. The salary
11 and benefit data provided must reflect approved Board of Regents operating budgets.
12 The commissioner may adjust the funding distribution between community colleges based on actual weighted FTE enrollment.
13 The community college FTE decrease funding factor is $6,000 for FY 2026 and $6,000 for FY 2027. The community college FTE increase funding factor is $8,000 for FY 2026 and $8,000 for FY 2027. The community
14 college weighting factors for the 2027 biennium are 1.50 for CTE FTE, 1.00 for general education FTE, 0.50 for early college FTE, and 0.25 for concurrent enrollment FTE.
15 The general fund appropriation for Community College Assistance is calculated to fund education in the community colleges for an estimated 1,911 resident FTE in FY 2026 and 1,996 in FY 2027. If actual weighted
16 resident FTE student enrollment in the community colleges is greater than the estimated number for the biennium, the community colleges must receive a reimbursement for the underpayment from the community college
17 FTE adjustment account. If actual weighted resident FTE student enrollment is less than the estimated numbers for the biennium, the community colleges shall pay a fee equal to the overpayment amount to be deposited
18 in the FTE adjustment account in accordance with section 20-15-328, MCA.
19 Total audit costs are estimated to be $358,500 for the community colleges for the biennium. Audit costs charged to the community colleges for the biennium may not exceed $60,500 for Flathead Valley Community
20 College, $188,000 for Miles Community College, and $110,000 for Dawson Community College. Total audit costs for UM - Missoula is $549,653 and MSU - Bozeman is $542,668.
21 If LC 958 is not passed and approved, the appropriation for Non-Beneficiary Increase is void.

10 All appropriations for the Legislative Branch are biennial.
11 It is the intent of the Legislature that Pension Actuarial not be included in the Legislative Fiscal Division’s budget request for the 2029 biennium.
12 Audit and Examination includes a one-time-only reduction of general fund of $469,568 in FY 2026 and $477,759 in FY 2027 and increase of state special revenue of $469,568 in FY 2026 and $477,759 in FY 2027
13 because of an anticipated temporary increase in the number of hours to complete the Federal Single Audit.
14 Audit and Examination includes a one-time-only increase of general fund of $132,165 in FY 2026 and $132,165 in FY 2027 and decrease of state special revenue of $132,165 in FY 2026 and $132,165 in FY 2027
15 because of proposed changes in information technology audits included in LC 4208. If LC 4208 is not passed and approved, then the increase in general fund and the decrease in state special revenue in FY 2026 and
16 FY 2027 is void.
17 The general fund appropriations in FY 2026 and FY 2027 for Hotline Cases and Other Contingencies are for contracted services necessary under section 5-13-305, MCA, relating to increased activities for hotline
18 cases and other contingencies.
19 Analysis of Montana Budget Implications From Federal Action is contingent on one of the following events occurring in either fiscal year of the 2027 biennium: (1) passage of a bill or other type of legislation from
20 either chamber of Congress or executive order that reduces anticipated federal revenues to Montana by more than $100 million in the 2027 biennium; (2) passage of a bill or other type of legislation by both chambers of
21 Congress or executive order that cancels previously enacted spending in a manner that reduces anticipated federal revenues to Montana by more than $50 million; or (3) passage of a bill or other type of legislation from
