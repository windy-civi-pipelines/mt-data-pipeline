5 (i) the infant is chronically and irreversibly comatose;
6 (ii) the provision of treatment would:
7 (A) merely prolong dying;
8 (B) not be effective in ameliorating or correcting all of the infant's life-threatening conditions; or
9 (C) otherwise be futile in terms of the survival of the infant; or
10 (iii) the provision of treatment would be virtually futile in terms of the survival of the infant and the
11 treatment itself under the circumstances would be inhumane. For purposes of this subsection (35), "infant"
12 means an infant less than 1 year of age or an infant 1 year of age or older who has been continuously
13 hospitalized since birth, who was born extremely prematurely, or who has a long-term disability. The reference
14 to less than 1 year of age may not be construed to imply that treatment should be changed or discontinued
15 when an infant reaches 1 year of age or to affect or limit any existing protections available under state laws
16 regarding medical neglect of children 1 year of age or older.
17 (36) "Youth in need of care" means a youth who has been adjudicated or determined, after a
18 hearing, to be or to have been abused, neglected, or abandoned."
