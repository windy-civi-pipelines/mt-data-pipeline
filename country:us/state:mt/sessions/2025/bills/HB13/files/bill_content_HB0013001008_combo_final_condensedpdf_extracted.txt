8 each fiscal year.
9 (iii) If a political subdivision has made contributions for group benefits but has not previously levied
10 for contributions in excess of the base contribution, the political subdivision's base is determined by multiplying

1 (c) (i) Subject to subsections (4)(c)(ii) and (4)(c)(iii), the base contribution is determined by
2 multiplying the average annual contribution for each employee on July 1, 1999, times the number of employees
3 for whom the employer makes contributions for group benefits under 2-9-212 on July 1 of each fiscal year.
4 (ii) If a political subdivision did not make contributions for group benefits on or before July 1, 1999,
5 and subsequently does so, the base contribution is determined by multiplying the average annual contribution
6 for each employee in the first year the political subdivision provides contributions for group benefits times the
7 number of employees for whom the employer makes contributions for group benefits under 2-9-212 on July 1 of
8 each fiscal year.
9 (iii) If a political subdivision has made contributions for group benefits but has not previously levied
10 for contributions in excess of the base contribution, the political subdivision's base is determined by multiplying
11 the average annual contribution for each employee at the beginning of the fiscal year immediately preceding
12 the year in which the levy will first be levied times the number of employees for whom the employer made
13 contributions for group benefits under 2-9-212 in that fiscal year.

20 the group.

22 fide group insurance plans from providing greater or additional contributions for insurance benefits to
23 employees with dependents than to employees without dependents or with fewer dependents."
