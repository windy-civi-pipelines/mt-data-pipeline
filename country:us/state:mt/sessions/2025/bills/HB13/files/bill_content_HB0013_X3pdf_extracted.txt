(ii) If a political subdivision did not make contributions for group benefits on or before July 1, 1999,
and subsequently does so, the base contribution is determined by multiplying the average annual contribution

for contributions in excess of the base contribution, the political subdivision's base is determined by multiplying

the year in which the levy will first be levied times the number of employees for whom the employer made
contributions for group benefits under 2-9-212 in that fiscal year.

account established for this purpose by a self-insured government and upon transfer may be used to offset
losses occurring to the group of which the employee is eligible to be a member or to increase the reserves of

legislators serving in the legislative session beginning in January 2027, the salary of each legislator must be

for the state of Montana, all industry types, posted by the United States bureau of labor statistics from the most
recently published quarter of employment and wages data. The average hourly rate must be calculated by
dividing the average weekly wage by 40 hours. The president of the senate and the speaker of the house must

(2) Legislators may serve for no salary.
(3) Legislators are entitled to a daily allowance, 7 days a week, during a legislative session, as

government is generally entitled to receive as per diem for lodging, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and incidental
expenses while away from home in the city of Helena but serving in the United States. Expense payments must
stop when the legislature recesses for more than 3 days and resume when the legislature reconvenes.
(4) Legislators are entitled to a mileage allowance as provided in 2-18-503 for each mile of travel

an appropriate claim for mileage reimbursement to the legislative services division, are entitled to:
(a) three additional round trips to their place of residence during each regular session; and
(b) additional round trips as authorized by the legislature during special session.
(6) Legislators are not entitled to any additional mileage allowance under subsection (4) for a
special session if it is convened within 7 days of a regular session.
(7) The department of administration shall work with the legislative services division to offer
options to legislators to receive their session salary provided for in subsection (1) over the 2-year legislative

self-only coverage and coverage other than self-only that will trigger the excise tax under 26 U.S.C. 4980I,
including any cost-of-living adjustments under 26 U.S.C. 4980I. This section limits contributions for group

(c) (i) Subject to subsections (4)(c)(ii) and (4)(c)(iii), the base contribution is determined by
multiplying the average annual contribution for each employee on July 1, 1999, times the number of employees
for whom the employer makes contributions for group benefits under 2-9-212 on July 1 of each fiscal year.
(ii) If a political subdivision did not make contributions for group benefits on or before July 1, 1999,
and subsequently does so, the base contribution is determined by multiplying the average annual contribution
for each employee in the first year the political subdivision provides contributions for group benefits times the
number of employees for whom the employer makes contributions for group benefits under 2-9-212 on July 1 of
each fiscal year.
(iii) If a political subdivision has made contributions for group benefits but has not previously levied
for contributions in excess of the base contribution, the political subdivision's base is determined by multiplying
the average annual contribution for each employee at the beginning of the fiscal year immediately preceding
the year in which the levy will first be levied times the number of employees for whom the employer made
contributions for group benefits under 2-9-212 in that fiscal year.
(5) Unused employer contributions for any state employee must be transferred to an account
established for this purpose by the department of administration and upon transfer may be used to offset losses
occurring to the group of which the employee is eligible to be a member.
(6) Unused employer contributions for any government employee may be transferred to an
account established for this purpose by a self-insured government and upon transfer may be used to offset
losses occurring to the group of which the employee is eligible to be a member or to increase the reserves of
the group.
(7) The laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of marital status in Title 49 do not prohibit bona
fide group insurance plans from providing greater or additional contributions for insurance benefits to
employees with dependents than to employees without dependents or with fewer dependents."

to a salary commensurate to that of the daily rate for an employee earning $10.33 an hour when the regular
session of the legislature in which they serve is convened under 5-2-103 for those days during which the
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 13
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0013
legislature is in session. The hourly rate must be adjusted by any statutorily required pay increase For the
legislators serving in the legislative session beginning in January 2027, the salary of each legislator must be
determined by multiplying 80% times the average hourly wage for the state of Montana, all industry types,
posted by the United States bureau of labor statistics from the most recently published quarter of employment
and wages data. For the legislators serving in the legislative session beginning in January 2029 and any
subsequent biennium, the salary of each legislator must be determined to be equal to the average hourly wage
for the state of Montana, all industry types, posted by the United States bureau of labor statistics from the most
recently published quarter of employment and wages data. The average hourly rate must be calculated by
dividing the average weekly wage by 40 hours. The president of the senate and the speaker of the house must
receive an additional $5 a day in salary for those days during which the legislature is in session.
(2) Legislators may serve for no salary.
(3) Legislators are entitled to a daily allowance, 7 days a week, during a legislative session, as
reimbursement for lodging, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and incidental expenses incurred in attending a session.
The amount of the daily allowance is equal to the amount an employee of the executive branch of the federal
government is generally entitled to receive as per diem for lodging, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and incidental
expenses while away from home in the city of Helena but serving in the United States. Expense payments must
stop when the legislature recesses for more than 3 days and resume when the legislature reconvenes.
(4) Legislators are entitled to a mileage allowance as provided in 2-18-503 for each mile of travel
to the place of the holding of the session and to return to their place of residence at the conclusion of the
session.
(5) In addition to the mileage allowance provided for in subsection (4), legislators, on submittal of
an appropriate claim for mileage reimbursement to the legislative services division, are entitled to:
(a) three additional round trips to their place of residence during each regular session; and
(b) additional round trips as authorized by the legislature during special session.
(6) Legislators are not entitled to any additional mileage allowance under subsection (4) for a
special session if it is convened within 7 days of a regular session.
(7) The department of administration shall work with the legislative services division to offer
options to legislators to receive their session salary provided for in subsection (1) over the 2-year legislative
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – HB 13

term or a portion of the term. The options must be offered to all legislators in order to assist legislators to
manage their income over the term. The per diem allowance and mileage as provided in this section, salary
during a special session as provided in 5-3-101, and the salary during the interim as provided for in 5-2-302
may not be affected."
