7 and the prescribing practitioner must have access to request a step therapy exception through a clear and
8 convenient process that must be readily accessible through the insurer's or utilization review organization’s

26 known characteristics of the prescription drug;

28 same mechanism of action as another prescription drug that has been prescribed to the patient and was

6 (b) If exigent circumstances exist, a determination must be made within 24 hours.
7 (c) If no determination has been made within the applicable time specified, the exception is
8 deemed to be granted.

10 information is required, the insurer or the utilization review organization shall notify the prescribing practitioner
11 within the appropriate timeframe pursuant to subsection (6) as to what additional or clinically relevant
12 information is required to approve or deny the step therapy exception request or appeal pursuant to the criteria
13 disclosed in subsection (1). Once the requested information has been submitted, the applicable timeframe as

15 determination applies.
16 (8) Upon the grant of a step therapy exception, the insurer or the utilization review organization
17 shall authorize coverage for the particular prescription drug prescribed by the patient’s health care provider.
18 Any adverse determination under this subsection is subject to appeal pursuant to the insurer's or utilization
19 review organization’s existing appeal procedures.
20 (9) Every insurer or utilization review organization that is subject to this section shall certify
21 annually to the state commissioner of securities and insurance that the insurer's or utilization review
22 organization’s step therapy protocol meets the requirements of this section. Any proposed change in protocol or
23 clinical review criteria must be submitted to the commissioner for approval before it may be implemented by the
24 insurer or the utilization review organization.
25 (10) The state commissioner of securities and insurance shall adopt rules necessary for the
26 purposes of this section.

12 (12) This section applies to any state-regulated plan or health insurance coverage offered in
13 connection with a state-regulated plan that provides coverage of a prescription drug pursuant to a policy that
14 meets the definition of a step therapy protocol, regardless of whether the policy is described as a step therapy
15 protocol.
16 (13) Nothing in this section may be construed to prevent:
17 (a) an insurer or a utilization review organization from requiring a patient to try an AB-rated generic
18 equivalent drug or interchangeable biological product before providing coverage for a name-brand prescription
19 drug, unless the requirement meets the qualifications for a step therapy exception pursuant to subsection (5);
20 (b) an insurer or a utilization review organization from requiring a pharmacist to provide
21 substitutions of prescription drugs pursuant to 37-7-505; or
22 (c) a health care provider from prescribing any prescription drug that the provider finds to be
23 medically appropriate for the patient.
