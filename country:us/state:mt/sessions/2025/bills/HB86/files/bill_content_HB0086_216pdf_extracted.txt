2 1986, but does not prohibit a brewer who is a party to an agreement from requiring the appointed distributor to
3 fulfill similar service obligations in the territory.
4
5 NEW SECTION. Section 10. Winery or wine importer prohibitions -- illegal acts by brewers or
6 beer importers. (1) A winery or wine importer or an officer, agent or representative of a winery or wine importer
7 may not:
8 (a) coerce, induce, or attempt to coerce or induce a distributor to engage in an illegal act or course
9 of conduct;
10 (b) require a distributor to accept delivery of a product or other item or commodity that was not
11 ordered by the distributor; or
12 (c) fix or maintain the price at which a distributor shall resell table wine.
13 (2) A brewer or beer importer or an officer, agent, or representative of a brewer or beer importer
14 may not:
15 (a) coerce, attempt to coerce, or persuade any person licensed to sell beer as a distributor to enter
16 into any agreement or to take any action that would violate or tend to violate any of the laws of this state or any
17 rules promulgated by the department;
18 (b) sell its products in the state without a written contract that conforms to the provisions of
19 [sections 1 through 20] with each appointed licensed distributor;
20 (c) designate or allow more than one distributor to sell or distribute a specific brand of the brewer's
21 or beer importer's products to retail licensees in the same area, provided that nothing in [sections 1 through 20]

23 brands of the same manufacturer to retail licensees in the same area;
24 (d) fix or maintain the price at which a distributor resells the brewer's or beer importer's products.
25 Without limitation, it is a violation of this section if:
26 (i) after a distributor has exceeded a resale price increase recommended by a brewer or beer
27 importer, the brewer or beer importer raises the price that it charges the distributor for those products within 60
28 days;
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – HB 86
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0086.2
1 (ii) after a distributor has exceeded a resale price increase recommended by a brewer or beer
2 importer, the brewer or beer importer raises the price that it charges the distributor in an amount proportionately
3 larger than the amount that it raised the distributor's prices initially when compared to the increase in the resale
4 price that it recommended to the distributor; or
5 (iii) the brewer or beer importer links or ties its participation in promotional discounts to the
6 distributor's compliance with any recommended resale price.
7 (e) cancel, terminate, discontinue, or fail to renew, except for just cause and in accordance with
8 the current terms and standards established by the brewer or beer importer then equally applicable to all
9 distributors, any agreement or contract, written or oral, or the franchise of any wholesaler existing on January 1,
10 1974, or entered into after that date to sell beer manufactured by the brewer or imported by the beer importer. A
11 brewer or beer importer may, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, make reasonable classifications among
12 distributors. If a brewer or beer importer cancels or terminates a distributor's franchise, the brewer or beer
13 importer has the burden of proving that the classification was reasonable and not arbitrary. The provisions of
14 [sections 1 through 20] must be a part of any franchise, contract, agreement, or understanding, whether written
15 or oral, between any distributor of beer licensed to do business in this state and any manufacturer or beer
16 importer doing business with the licensed distributor just as though the provisions had been specifically agreed
17 upon between the distributor and the manufacturer or beer importer. A distributor of beer licensed to conduct
18 business in the state may not waive any of the protections or agree to any provision contrary to [sections 1
19 through 20] by any conduct, including but not limited to the signing of any contract or agreement with terms
20 contrary to those provisions.
21 (3) (a) Just cause as used in subsection (2)(e) means that the distributor failed to comply with the
22 reasonable requirements placed on the distributor by the brewer or beer importer as a part of any written
23 franchise, contract, or agreement between the parties.
24 (b) The sale or purchase or other restructuring of the brewer or beer importer by a successor in the
25 manufacturing tier of the beer industry does not constitute just cause as that term is used in subsection (2)(e).
26 (c) For the purposes of this subsection (3), a successor means a person or entity that replaces a
27 brewer or beer importer with regard to the right to manufacture, sell, distribute, or import a brand or brands of
28 beer regardless of the character or form of the succession. A successor is obligated to all of the terms and
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 86
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0086.2
1 conditions of any franchise, contract, agreement, or understanding, whether written or oral, in effect on the date
2 of succession. A successor has the right to contractually require its distributor to comply with operational
3 standards of performance if the standards are uniformly established for all of the successor's distributors and
4 conform to the requirements of this section.
5
6 NEW SECTION. Section 11. Transfer of distributor's interest in business. A distributor may sell
7 or transfer the business or an interest in the business to any person or to one or more members of the
8 distributor's family or heirs or legatees, whether the distributor operates as an individual, a partnership, or
9 corporation. However, the consent of the brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer in writing is required
10 for the transferee to continue as a distributor of the brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer. The
11 consent must consider the personal, financial, and managerial responsibilities and capabilities of the transferee,
12 and the consent may not unreasonably be withheld.
13
14 NEW SECTION. Section 12. Contractual or franchise relationship -- existence by actions. The
15 doing or accomplishing of any of the following acts constitutes prima facie evidence of a contractual or
16 franchise relationship between a licensed distributor and a brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer
17 within the intention of [sections 1 through 20]:
18 (1) the shipment, preparation for shipment, or acceptance of any order by any brewer, beer
19 importer, winery, or wine importer or its agent for any beer, table wine, or sacramental wine to a licensed
20 distributor within this state; or
21 (2) the payment by any licensed distributor within this state or the acceptance of payment by any
22 brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer or its agent for the shipment of an order of beer, table wine, or
23 sacramental wine intended for sale within this state.
24
25 NEW SECTION. Section 13. Distributor agreements filed with department. Within 60 days after
26 entering into a new agreement, an exact copy of all agreements, contracts, or franchises between a brewer,
27 beer importer, winery, or wine importer and a distributor must be filed by the distributor with the department as
28 a public document and must be available to any of the parties to a dispute. The department, on the instigation
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 86
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0086.2
1 of an action in a court of record, shall file an exact certified copy of the agreement with the court for the court's
2 consideration in determining any matter before it. Any contracts, agreements, or franchises not on record with
3 the department may not be considered by a court as having any force or effect. The distributor shall notify the
4 brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer of the filing of the agreement with the department.
5

9 to a licensed distributor and unloaded into the distributor's warehouse in Montana or subwarehouse in Montana.
10 A brewer or beer importer shall maintain records of all beer, including the name or kind received, on hand, and
11 sold. The records may at any time be inspected by a representative of the department. The distributor shall
12 distribute the beer from the warehouse or subwarehouse and shall keep records at the distributor's licensed
13 premises of all beer, including the name or kind received, on hand, sold, and distributed. The records may be
14 inspected by a representative of the department at any time.

10 an employee obtain from the distributor’s warehouse any quantity of table wine as the agent or retailer and
11 distributor may agree to buy and sell only within the territory of the distributor in which the agent’s liquor store or
12 retailer is located.
13 (7) When a distributor’s trucks and equipment are incapable of delivering beer, table wine, or
14 sacramental wine to a retail licensee's premises due to the unique physical location of the retail licensee's
15 premises, examples of which are premises located on an island or atop a mountain, the distributor and retail
16 licensee may seek prior department approval for an alternative delivery arrangement on a form provided by the
17 department. If the department approves the alternative delivery arrangement request, the department shall
18 provide the distributor and the retail licensee a written summary of the conditions of the approved delivery

5 NEW SECTION. Section 10. Winery or wine importer prohibitions -- illegal acts by brewers or
6 beer importers. (1) A winery or wine importer or an officer, agent or representative of a winery or wine importer
7 may not:
8 (a) coerce, induce, or attempt to coerce or induce a distributor to engage in an illegal act or course
9 of conduct;
10 (b) require a distributor to accept delivery of a product or other item or commodity that was not
11 ordered by the distributor; or
12 (c) fix or maintain the price at which a distributor shall resell table wine.
13 (2) A brewer or beer importer or an officer, agent, or representative of a brewer or beer importer
14 may not:
15 (a) coerce, attempt to coerce, or persuade any person licensed to sell beer as a distributor to enter
16 into any agreement or to take any action that would violate or tend to violate any of the laws of this state or any
17 rules promulgated by the department;
18 (b) sell its products in the state without a written contract that conforms to the provisions of
19 [sections 1 through 20] with each appointed licensed distributor;
20 (c) designate or allow more than one distributor to sell or distribute a specific brand of the brewer's
21 or beer importer's products to retail licensees in the same area, provided that nothing in [sections 1 through 20]
22 prohibits the brewer or beer importer from designating more than one distributor to sell or distribute different
23 brands of the same manufacturer to retail licensees in the same area;
24 (d) fix or maintain the price at which a distributor resells the brewer's or beer importer's products.
25 Without limitation, it is a violation of this section if:
26 (i) after a distributor has exceeded a resale price increase recommended by a brewer or beer
27 importer, the brewer or beer importer raises the price that it charges the distributor for those products within 60
28 days;
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – HB 86

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0086.2
1 (ii) after a distributor has exceeded a resale price increase recommended by a brewer or beer
2 importer, the brewer or beer importer raises the price that it charges the distributor in an amount proportionately
3 larger than the amount that it raised the distributor's prices initially when compared to the increase in the resale
4 price that it recommended to the distributor; or
5 (iii) the brewer or beer importer links or ties its participation in promotional discounts to the
6 distributor's compliance with any recommended resale price.
7 (e) cancel, terminate, discontinue, or fail to renew, except for just cause and in accordance with
8 the current terms and standards established by the brewer or beer importer then equally applicable to all
9 distributors, any agreement or contract, written or oral, or the franchise of any wholesaler existing on January 1,
10 1974, or entered into after that date to sell beer manufactured by the brewer or imported by the beer importer. A
11 brewer or beer importer may, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, make reasonable classifications among
12 distributors. If a brewer or beer importer cancels or terminates a distributor's franchise, the brewer or beer
13 importer has the burden of proving that the classification was reasonable and not arbitrary. The provisions of
14 [sections 1 through 20] must be a part of any franchise, contract, agreement, or understanding, whether written
15 or oral, between any distributor of beer licensed to do business in this state and any manufacturer or beer
16 importer doing business with the licensed distributor just as though the provisions had been specifically agreed
17 upon between the distributor and the manufacturer or beer importer. A distributor of beer licensed to conduct
18 business in the state may not waive any of the protections or agree to any provision contrary to [sections 1
19 through 20] by any conduct, including but not limited to the signing of any contract or agreement with terms
20 contrary to those provisions.
21 (3) (a) Just cause as used in subsection (2)(e) means that the distributor failed to comply with the
22 reasonable requirements placed on the distributor by the brewer or beer importer as a part of any written
23 franchise, contract, or agreement between the parties.
24 (b) The sale or purchase or other restructuring of the brewer or beer importer by a successor in the
25 manufacturing tier of the beer industry does not constitute just cause as that term is used in subsection (2)(e).
26 (c) For the purposes of this subsection (3), a successor means a person or entity that replaces a
27 brewer or beer importer with regard to the right to manufacture, sell, distribute, or import a brand or brands of
28 beer regardless of the character or form of the succession. A successor is obligated to all of the terms and
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 86

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0086.2
1 conditions of any franchise, contract, agreement, or understanding, whether written or oral, in effect on the date
2 of succession. A successor has the right to contractually require its distributor to comply with operational
3 standards of performance if the standards are uniformly established for all of the successor's distributors and
4 conform to the requirements of this section.
5
6 NEW SECTION. Section 11. Transfer of distributor's interest in business. A distributor may sell
7 or transfer the business or an interest in the business to any person or to one or more members of the
8 distributor's family or heirs or legatees, whether the distributor operates as an individual, a partnership, or
9 corporation. However, the consent of the brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer in writing is required
10 for the transferee to continue as a distributor of the brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer. The
11 consent must consider the personal, financial, and managerial responsibilities and capabilities of the transferee,
12 and the consent may not unreasonably be withheld.
13
14 NEW SECTION. Section 12. Contractual or franchise relationship -- existence by actions. The

18 (1) the shipment, preparation for shipment, or acceptance of any order by any brewer, beer
19 importer, winery, or wine importer or its agent for any beer, table wine, or sacramental wine to a licensed
