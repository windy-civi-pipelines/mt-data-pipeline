6 of an agreement of distributorship unless a termination without notice is permitted as provided in [section 7].

14 (3) If a winery or wine importer terminates an agreement of distributorship under the provisions of
15 subsection (2)(a), the distributor subject to the termination is entitled to compensation for the laid-in cost of

19 brands involved, as may be provided in the agreement. If the winery or wine importer and the distributor are
20 unable to agree on the amount of liquidated damages, the amount of liquidated damages must be determined
21 by an arbitrator appointed under subsection (4).
22 (4) If undertaken in good faith by a winery or wine importer, a winery or wine importer may
23 terminate an agreement of distributorship for a legitimate business reason not within the definition of good
24 cause if an arbitrator appointed by the department finds, after hearing the winery or wine importer and the
25 distributor, that the termination is in the best interest of the brands concerned. Arbitration under this section
26 must be conducted under the provisions of Title 27, chapter 5.

21 distributor.
22 (3) A winery or wine importer may terminate an agreement of distributorship immediately and

9 distributor appointed to distribute a brand of beer within a territory specified by agreement pursuant to [section
10 5] shall call on and offer that brand to at least 75% of the retailers within that territory at least every 3 weeks.
11 However, if the brand of beer for which the distributor is appointed is a product of a brewer or beer importer
12 whose products are not generally available, the distributor shall, at least every 3 weeks, call on and offer that
13 brand to as many retailers within that territory as is reasonably possible given the amount of that brand that is
14 available to the distributor.
15 (2) If a retailer's account with a distributor is current as required under 16-3-243, the distributor
16 may not refuse to sell the retailer any generally available brand of beer for which the distributor has been

- 7 - Authorized Print Version – HB 86
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 86.1
1 1986, but does not prohibit a brewer who is a party to an agreement from requiring the appointed distributor to
2 fulfill similar service obligations in the territory.
3
4 NEW SECTION. Section 10. Winery or wine importer prohibitions -- illegal acts by brewers or
5 beer importers. (1) A winery or wine importer or an officer, agent or representative of a winery or wine importer
6 may not:
7 (a) coerce, induce, or attempt to coerce or induce a distributor to engage in an illegal act or course
8 of conduct;
9 (b) require a distributor to accept delivery of a product or other item or commodity that was not
10 ordered by the distributor; or
11 (c) fix or maintain the price at which a distributor shall resell table wine.
12 (2) A brewer or beer importer or an officer, agent, or representative of a brewer or beer importer
13 may not:
14 (a) coerce, attempt to coerce, or persuade any person licensed to sell beer as a distributor to enter
15 into any agreement or to take any action that would violate or tend to violate any of the laws of this state or any
16 rules promulgated by the department;
17 (b) sell its products in the state without a written contract that conforms to the provisions of
18 [sections 1 through 20] with each appointed licensed distributor;
19 (c) designate or allow more than one distributor to sell or distribute a specific brand of the brewer's

22 brands of the same manufacturer to retail licensees in the same area;
23 (d) fix or maintain the price at which a distributor resells the brewer's or beer importer's products.
24 Without limitation, it is a violation of this section if:
25 (i) after a distributor has exceeded a resale price increase recommended by a brewer or beer
26 importer, the brewer or beer importer raises the price that it charges the distributor for those products within 60
27 days;
28 (ii) after a distributor has exceeded a resale price increase recommended by a brewer or beer
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – HB 86
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 86.1
1 importer, the brewer or beer importer raises the price that it charges the distributor in an amount proportionately
2 larger than the amount that it raised the distributor's prices initially when compared to the increase in the resale
3 price that it recommended to the distributor; or
4 (iii) the brewer or beer importer links or ties its participation in promotional discounts to the
5 distributor's compliance with any recommended resale price.
6 (e) cancel, terminate, discontinue, or fail to renew, except for just cause and in accordance with
7 the current terms and standards established by the brewer or beer importer then equally applicable to all
8 distributors, any agreement or contract, written or oral, or the franchise of any wholesaler existing on January 1,
9 1974, or entered into after that date to sell beer manufactured by the brewer or imported by the beer importer. A
10 brewer or beer importer may, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, make reasonable classifications among
11 distributors. If a brewer or beer importer cancels or terminates a distributor's franchise, the brewer or beer
12 importer has the burden of proving that the classification was reasonable and not arbitrary. The provisions of
13 [sections 1 through 20] must be a part of any franchise, contract, agreement, or understanding, whether written
14 or oral, between any distributor of beer licensed to do business in this state and any manufacturer or beer
15 importer doing business with the licensed distributor just as though the provisions had been specifically agreed
16 upon between the distributor and the manufacturer or beer importer. A distributor of beer licensed to conduct
17 business in the state may not waive any of the protections or agree to any provision contrary to [sections 1
18 through 20] by any conduct, including but not limited to the signing of any contract or agreement with terms
19 contrary to those provisions.
20 (3) (a) Just cause as used in subsection (2)(e) means that the distributor failed to comply with the
21 reasonable requirements placed on the distributor by the brewer or beer importer as a part of any written
22 franchise, contract, or agreement between the parties.
23 (b) The sale or purchase or other restructuring of the brewer or beer importer by a successor in the
24 manufacturing tier of the beer industry does not constitute just cause as that term is used in subsection (2)(e).
25 (c) For the purposes of this subsection (3), a successor means a person or entity that replaces a
26 brewer or beer importer with regard to the right to manufacture, sell, distribute, or import a brand or brands of
27 beer regardless of the character or form of the succession. A successor is obligated to all of the terms and
28 conditions of any franchise, contract, agreement, or understanding, whether written or oral, in effect on the date
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 86
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 86.1
1 of succession. A successor has the right to contractually require its distributor to comply with operational
2 standards of performance if the standards are uniformly established for all of the successor's distributors and
3 conform to the requirements of this section.
4
5 NEW SECTION. Section 11. Transfer of distributor's interest in business. A distributor may sell
6 or transfer the business or an interest in the business to any person or to one or more members of the
7 distributor's family or heirs or legatees, whether the distributor operates as an individual, a partnership, or
8 corporation. However, the consent of the brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer in writing is required
9 for the transferee to continue as a distributor of the brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer. The
10 consent must consider the personal, financial, and managerial responsibilities and capabilities of the transferee,
11 and the consent may not unreasonably be withheld.
12
13 NEW SECTION. Section 12. Contractual or franchise relationship -- existence by actions. The
14 doing or accomplishing of any of the following acts constitutes prima facie evidence of a contractual or
15 franchise relationship between a licensed distributor and a brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer
16 within the intention of [sections 1 through 20]:
17 (1) the shipment, preparation for shipment, or acceptance of any order by any brewer, beer
18 importer, winery, or wine importer or its agent for any beer, table wine, or sacramental wine to a licensed
19 distributor within this state; or
20 (2) the payment by any licensed distributor within this state or the acceptance of payment by any
21 brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer or its agent for the shipment of an order of beer, table wine, or
22 sacramental wine intended for sale within this state.
23
24 NEW SECTION. Section 13. Distributor agreements filed with department. Within 60 days after
25 entering into a new agreement, an exact copy of all agreements, contracts, or franchises between a brewer,
26 beer importer, winery, or wine importer and a distributor must be filed by the distributor with the department as
27 a public document and must be available to any of the parties to a dispute. The department, on the instigation
28 of an action in a court of record, shall file an exact certified copy of the agreement with the court for the court's
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 86
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 86.1
1 consideration in determining any matter before it. Any contracts, agreements, or franchises not on record with
2 the department may not be considered by a court as having any force or effect. The distributor shall notify the
3 brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer of the filing of the agreement with the department.
4
5 NEW SECTION. Section 14. Beer required to be shipped to distributor. Except as provided in 16-

8 to a licensed distributor and unloaded into the distributor's warehouse in Montana or subwarehouse in Montana.
9 A brewer or beer importer shall maintain records of all beer, including the name or kind received, on hand, and
10 sold. The records may at any time be inspected by a representative of the department. The distributor shall
11 distribute the beer from the warehouse or subwarehouse and shall keep records at the distributor's licensed
12 premises of all beer, including the name or kind received, on hand, sold, and distributed. The records may be
13 inspected by a representative of the department at any time.

26 warehouse any quantity of beer as the all-beverages licensee and distributor may agree to buy and sell.

9 an employee obtain from the distributor’s warehouse any quantity of table wine as the agent or retailer and
10 distributor may agree to buy and sell only within the territory of the distributor in which the agent’s liquor store or
11 retailer is located.
12 (7) When a distributor’s trucks and equipment are incapable of delivering beer, table wine, or
13 sacramental wine to a retail licensee's premises due to the unique physical location of the retail licensee's
14 premises, examples of which are premises located on an island or atop a mountain, the distributor and retail
15 licensee may seek prior department approval for an alternative delivery arrangement on a form provided by the
16 department. If the department approves the alternative delivery arrangement request, the department shall
17 provide the distributor and the retail licensee a written summary of the conditions of the approved delivery
18 arrangement. Failure to comply with the approved alternative delivery arrangement may subject the distributor

22 (4) If undertaken in good faith by a winery or wine importer, a winery or wine importer may
23 terminate an agreement of distributorship for a legitimate business reason not within the definition of good
24 cause if an arbitrator appointed by the department finds, after hearing the winery or wine importer and the
25 distributor, that the termination is in the best interest of the brands concerned. Arbitration under this section
26 must be conducted under the provisions of Title 27, chapter 5.
27 (5) All agreements of distributorship are interpreted and governed by the laws of Montana.

22 brands of the same manufacturer to retail licensees in the same area;
23 (d) fix or maintain the price at which a distributor resells the brewer's or beer importer's products.
24 Without limitation, it is a violation of this section if:

1 importer, the brewer or beer importer raises the price that it charges the distributor in an amount proportionately
2 larger than the amount that it raised the distributor's prices initially when compared to the increase in the resale
3 price that it recommended to the distributor; or
4 (iii) the brewer or beer importer links or ties its participation in promotional discounts to the

8 distributors, any agreement or contract, written or oral, or the franchise of any wholesaler existing on January 1,
9 1974, or entered into after that date to sell beer manufactured by the brewer or imported by the beer importer. A
10 brewer or beer importer may, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, make reasonable classifications among
11 distributors. If a brewer or beer importer cancels or terminates a distributor's franchise, the brewer or beer
12 importer has the burden of proving that the classification was reasonable and not arbitrary. The provisions of
13 [sections 1 through 20] must be a part of any franchise, contract, agreement, or understanding, whether written
14 or oral, between any distributor of beer licensed to do business in this state and any manufacturer or beer
15 importer doing business with the licensed distributor just as though the provisions had been specifically agreed
16 upon between the distributor and the manufacturer or beer importer. A distributor of beer licensed to conduct
17 business in the state may not waive any of the protections or agree to any provision contrary to [sections 1
18 through 20] by any conduct, including but not limited to the signing of any contract or agreement with terms
19 contrary to those provisions.

23 (b) The sale or purchase or other restructuring of the brewer or beer importer by a successor in the
24 manufacturing tier of the beer industry does not constitute just cause as that term is used in subsection (2)(e).
25 (c) For the purposes of this subsection (3), a successor means a person or entity that replaces a
26 brewer or beer importer with regard to the right to manufacture, sell, distribute, or import a brand or brands of
27 beer regardless of the character or form of the succession. A successor is obligated to all of the terms and
28 conditions of any franchise, contract, agreement, or understanding, whether written or oral, in effect on the date

9 for the transferee to continue as a distributor of the brewer, beer importer, winery, or wine importer. The
