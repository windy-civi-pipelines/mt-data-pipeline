69th Legislature HJ 53
MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY ON IMPROVING SCHOOL SAFETY; AND REQUIRING
THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, the safety of children and the adults who educate and care for them is of paramount
importance;
WHEREAS, there is a strong correlation between a safe school environment and higher academic
achievement, with students in safer schools tending to have better grades and test scores; and
WHEREAS, safe schools promote positive social interactions, reduce bullying, and create a more
supportive environment for students to develop healthy relationships; and
WHEREAS, students who feel secure at school are more likely to be engaged in their learning and
actively participate in school activities; and
WHEREAS, Montana K-12 schools would benefit from a coordinated cross-system collaborative study
to identify existing and nonexistent school safety practices; and
WHEREAS, having proper safety protocols in place allows for effective collaborative response to
emergencies such as fires, medical emergencies, and active shooter scenarios; and
WHEREAS, Montana is one of the few states without a unified, coordinated approach to supporting
school safety and lacks a designated state system that provides schools with comprehensive guidance and
support.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
