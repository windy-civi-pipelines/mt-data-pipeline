8 WHEREAS, the safety of children and the adults who educate and care for them is of paramount
9 importance;
10 WHEREAS, there is a strong correlation between a safe school environment and higher academic
11 achievement, with students in safer schools tending to have better grades and test scores; and
12 WHEREAS, safe schools promote positive social interactions, reduce bullying, and create a more
13 supportive environment for students to develop healthy relationships; and
14 WHEREAS, students who feel secure at school are more likely to be engaged in their learning and
15 actively participate in school activities; and
16 WHEREAS, Montana K-12 schools would benefit from a coordinated cross-system collaborative study
17 to identify existing and nonexistent school safety practices; and
18 WHEREAS, having proper safety protocols in place allows for effective collaborative response to
19 emergencies such as fires, medical emergencies, and active shooter scenarios; and
20 WHEREAS, Montana is one of the few states without a unified, coordinated approach to supporting
21 school safety and lacks a designated state system that provides schools with comprehensive guidance and
22 support.
