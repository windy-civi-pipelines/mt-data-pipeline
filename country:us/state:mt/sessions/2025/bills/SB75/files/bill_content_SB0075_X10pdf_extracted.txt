Section 1:
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 75
TERMINATION DATE; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE AND A RETROACTIVE
APPLICABILITY DATE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:

Section 2:
Section 1. Revision of termination date -- conflicting amendments -- no revival of terminated
amendment. (1) The termination date of a statute may be revised by amending the session law for the initial
legislation that provided for the termination date. There is no limit on the number of times that a termination
date may be revised pursuant to this section.
(2) In the event of conflicting revisions to a termination date during the same legislative session,
the conflict may be resolved through a coordination instruction. If the conflict is not resolved through a
coordination instruction, the revised termination date that falls latest chronologically becomes law and all earlier
revised termination dates from the same legislative session are void.
(3) A termination date is not revised through an amendment of session law unless the legislation
revising the termination date is effective before the later of the initial termination date or the amended
termination date.
(4) As long as the session law of the initial legislation that provided for the termination date is
amended in the same enactment, this section does not invalidate the amendment of a termination date when
the session law that previously revised the termination date of the initial legislation is also amended.

Section 3:
Section 2. Codification instruction. [Section 1] is intended to be codified as an integral part of Title
1, chapter 2, part 2, and the provisions of Title 1, chapter 2, part 2, apply to [section 1].
