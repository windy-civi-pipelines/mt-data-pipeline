normal operating expenses of the department whenever those expenses are reasonably necessary to provide
for timely and adequate review of the application, including any environmental review conducted under Title 75,
chapter 1, parts 1 and 2. The department may further define these expenses by rule. Whenever the department
determines that an additional fee is necessary and the additional fee will exceed $5,000, the department shall
notify the applicant that a fee must be paid and submit to the applicant an itemized estimate of the proposed
expenses. The department shall provide the applicant an opportunity to review the department's estimated
expenses. The applicant may indicate which proposed expenses the applicant considers duplicative or
excessive, if any.

permittee does not file the required proof or if the hard-rock mining impact board certifies to the department that
the permittee has failed to comply with the hard-rock mining impact review and implementation requirements in
Title 90, chapter 6, parts 3 and 4, the department shall suspend the permit until the permittee files the required
proof or until the hard-rock mining impact board certifies that the permittee has complied with the hard-rock

or the completion of reclamation by the person's surety or by the department, unless that person meets the
conditions described in 82-4-360;
(b) that person has not paid a penalty for which the department has obtained a judgment pursuant
to 82-4-361;
(c) that person has failed to post a reclamation bond required by 82-4-305; or

the department has completed the abatement and the person has reimbursed the department for the cost of
abatement.
(9) A person may not be issued a permit under this part unless, at the time of submission of a
bond, the person provides the current information required in subsection (4)(a) and:
(a) (i) certifies that the person is not currently in violation in this state of any law, rule, or regulation
of this state or of the United States pertaining to air quality, water quality, or mined land reclamation; or
(ii) presents a certification by the administering agency that the violation is in the process of being
corrected to the agency's satisfaction or is the subject of a bona fide administrative or judicial appeal; and
(b) if the person is a partnership, corporation, or other business association, provides the

(iv) issue a draft permit. The department may, as a condition of issuing the draft permit, require that
the applicant obtain other permits required by law but not provided for in this part. However, the department
may not withhold issuance of the draft permit in the absence of those permits.
(f) Prior to issuance of a draft permit, the department shall inspect the site. If the site is not
accessible because of extended adverse weather conditions, the department shall inspect the site at the first
available opportunity and may extend the time period prescribed in subsection (1)(a) by a term agreed to by the
applicant.

substantive requirements of this part and the rules adopted pursuant to this part.
(j) If the department decides to hire a third-party contractor to prepare an environmental impact
statement on the application, the department shall prepare a list of no fewer than four contractors acceptable to
the department and shall provide the applicant with a copy of the list. The applicant shall provide the
department with a list of at least 50% of the contractors from the department's list. The department shall select

modified pursuant to subsection (1) for completeness and compliance and issuance of a new draft permit.
(b) The department shall consult with the applicant before placing stipulations in a draft or final
permit. Permit stipulations in a draft or final permit may, unless the applicant consents, address only
compliance issues within the substantive requirements of this part or rules adopted pursuant to this part. For a
stipulation imposed without the applicant's consent, the department shall provide to the applicant in writing the
reason for the stipulation, a citation to the statute or rule that gives the department the authority to impose the
stipulation, and, for a stipulation imposed in the final permit that was not contained in the draft permit, the
reason that the stipulation was not contained in the draft permit.
(c) Within 40 days of the completion of the review required by Title 75, chapter 1, or 1 year from
the date the draft permit is issued, whichever is less, the department shall issue its bond determination.

department, upon proper application of the permittee or after timely notice and opportunity for hearing, at any
time during the term of the permit and for any of the following reasons:
(a) to modify the requirements so that they will not conflict with existing laws;
(b) when the previously adopted reclamation plan is impossible or impracticable to implement and
maintain;

69th Legislature 2025 HB 699
(c) when significant environmental problem situations not permitted under the terms of regulatory
permits held by the permittee are revealed by field inspection and the department has the authority to address
them under the provisions of this part.
(5) (a) The modification of a final operating permit may be a major or minor permit amendment or a
permit revision. A modification of the operating permit, including a modification necessary to comply with the
requirements of existing law as interpreted by a court of competent jurisdiction must be processed in
accordance with the procedures for an application for a permit amendment or revision that are established
pursuant to 82-4-342 and this section.
(b) The modification of an operating permit may not be finalized and an existing bond amount may
not be increased until the permit modification procedures and analysis described in subsection (5)(a) are

or the completion of reclamation by the person's surety or by the department, unless that person meets the
conditions described in 82-4-360;
(b) that person has not paid a penalty for which the department has obtained a judgment pursuant
