18 (a) that person's failure, or the failure of any firm or business association of which that person was
19 a principal or controlling member, to comply with the provisions of this part, the rules adopted under this part, or
20 a permit or license issued under this part has resulted in either the receipt of bond proceeds by the department
21 or the completion of reclamation by the person's surety or by the department, unless that person meets the
22 conditions described in 82-4-360;
23 (b) that person has not paid a penalty for which the department has obtained a judgment pursuant
24 to 82-4-361;
