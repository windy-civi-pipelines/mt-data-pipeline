9 a principal or controlling member, to comply with the provisions of this part, the rules adopted under this part, or
10 a permit or license issued under this part has resulted in either the receipt of bond proceeds by the department
11 or the completion of reclamation by the person's surety or by the department, unless that person meets the
12 conditions described in 82-4-360;
13 (b) that person has not paid a penalty for which the department has obtained a judgment pursuant
