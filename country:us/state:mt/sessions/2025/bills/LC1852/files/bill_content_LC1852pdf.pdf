4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT REVISING LAWS RELATED TO LOBBYING; PROHIBITING
5 LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND STATE AGENCIES FROM EXPENDING PUBLIC FUNDS FOR LOBBYING ON
6 PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS; AMENDING SECTION 17-8-108, MCA; AND

8
9 WHEREAS, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, section 7, of the
10 Montana Constitution protect freedom of speech and freedom of expression; and
11 WHEREAS, those valued freedoms include the right to employ one's own resources to lobby and
12 otherwise seek to influence government policy; and
13 WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court has held that those freedoms also include the right to be
14 free from forced contributions for such activity; and
15 WHEREAS, it has come to the attention of the Legislature that some state agencies and local
16 governments have diverted public resources to legislative and administrative lobbying for policies at the
17 expense of citizens who may oppose those policies; and
18 WHEREAS, in addition to violating the spirit of the guarantees in the United States and Montana
19 Constitutions, a practice in which some may lobby with public funds while their opponents are limited to their
20 own resources creates an unfair distortion in the policymaking process that can result in poor policy decisions;
21 and
22 WHEREAS, Thomas Jefferson states that "to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the
23 propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical"; and
24 WHEREAS, the Legislature fully respects the constitutional right of public agencies and employees to
25 employ their own resources to lobby for their preferred policies but also fully respects the right of those who
26 disagree to not have their resources diverted for such purposes.
