dedicated to serving state and territorial legislatures and legislative staff; and

independence, and integrity of state legislatures, to foster interstate communication and cooperation, and to
ensure states have a strong, cohesive voice in the federal system; and

resolve complex issues even though they represent constituents from different communities and backgrounds;
