14 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
15 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
16 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
17 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
18 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
19 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
20 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
21 (b) (i) A Except as provided in subsection (1)(b)(ii), a governmental entity that does not impose the
22 maximum number of mills authorized under subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the
23 number of mills equal to the difference between the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number
24 of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
25 (ii) The authority to carry forward mills provided for in subsection (1)(b)(i) does not apply to mills
26 imposed under 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, or 20-25-439.
27 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
28 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,

3 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
4 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,

11 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
12 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
13 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
14 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
15 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
16 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;

18 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
19 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as

21 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
22 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
23 following tax year.
24 (c) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property
25 that was constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the

4 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
5 (6) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds

14 pursuant to subsection (1) may not generate an amount of property taxes that exceeds the amount of property
15 tax assessed in the prior year plus 3% of the property tax assessed in the prior year. The mill calculation must
16 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
17 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
