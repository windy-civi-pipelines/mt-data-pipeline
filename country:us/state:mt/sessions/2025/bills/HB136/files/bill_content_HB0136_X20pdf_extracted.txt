of the insurance either between insureds or property having like insuring or risk characteristics or between
insureds because of race, color, creed, religion, or national origin.

compensation to licensed insurance producers or as prohibiting an insurer from allowing or returning lawful
dividends, savings, or unabsorbed premium deposits to its participating policyholders, members, or subscribers.
(7) An insurer may not make or permit unfair discrimination between individuals or risks of the
same class and of essentially the same hazards by refusing to issue, refusing to renew, canceling, or limiting
the amount of insurance coverage on a property or casualty risk because of the geographic location of the risk,
unless:

unfair discrimination; or

property or casualty policy or contract of insurance solely because the applicant or insured or any employee of
either is mentally or physically impaired. However, this subsection does not apply to accident and health
insurance sold by a casualty insurer, and this subsection may not be interpreted to modify any other provision
of law relating to the termination, modification, issuance, or renewal of any insurance policy or contract.
(11) (a) An insurer may not refuse to insure, refuse to continue to insure, charge higher rates, or
