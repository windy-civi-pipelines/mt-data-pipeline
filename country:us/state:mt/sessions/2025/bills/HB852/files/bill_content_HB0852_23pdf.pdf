21 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
22
23 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Legislative findings -- purpose. The purpose and legislative intent of
24 this chapter, 46-4-508, and Title 46, chapter 9, are outlined in this section.
25 (1) The legislature finds that the purpose is to protect a surety bail bond agent's liability by allowing
26 preemptive action to secure the principal when necessary. The legislature finds that a court-issued forfeiture or
27 warrant is not a prerequisite to achieve this goal.
28 (2) The legislature adopts the doctrine established in Taylor v. Taintor, 83 U.S. 366 (1872), which
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – HB 852

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0852.2
1 stands for the following principles relating to surety bail bond insurance:
2 (a) When bail is given, the principal is regarded as delivered to the custody of the surety bail bond
3 insurance producer.
4
5 (b) The producer's dominion is a continuance of the original imprisonment. Whenever the producer
6 chooses, the producer may seize and deliver the principal in the producer's discharge or their surety obligations
7 ..
8
9 (c) If a producer cannot deliver the principal at once, the producer may imprison the principal until
10 this can be done ..
11 (d) (B) A producer may exercise their rights in person or, if necessary, the producer may delegate the
12 authority to apprehend the principal to a recovery agent who is licensed in the state in accordance with
13 applicable laws and administrative rules.
14
15 (e) The producer may pursue the principal into another state and may arrest the principal on any
16 day of the week.
17 (f) (C) If necessary, the producer is permitted to enter the principal's residence, including by force, if
18 necessary, to fulfill the producer's responsibilities as a surety bail bond insurance producer.
19 (g) (D) A producer need not apply to a court for a lengthy process in order to discharge the producer's
20 duties. A producer's actions are equated to the rearrest by a sheriff of an escaping prisoner.
21 (3) The legislature finds that the purpose of this chapter is to:
22 (a) prevent defendants from evading judicial review after surrender;
23 (b) prohibit judges from arbitrarily continuing bonds without the agreement of the surety bail bond
24 agent;
25 (c) declare that judicial continuance of a bond will be considered arbitrary if it occurs without
26 providing notice to the surety as it fails to articulate the necessity for continuance in the case record; and
27 (d) ensure detention centers and law enforcement comply with lawful surrender procedures to
28 maintain public safety.
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – HB 852

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0852.2
1 (4) The legislature finds that the purpose of [section 2] is to:
2 (a) recognize the surety bail bond agent's critical role in ensuring the defendant's appearance in
3 court and protecting public safety; and
4 (b) ensure the surety bail bond agent has sufficient access to judicial processes ABILITIES to fulfill
5 their obligations and address challenges in apprehending defendants.
6 (5) The legislature finds that the forfeiture provisions of this chapter are to:
7 (a) avoid disputes over notification timing by clearly defining the start and end points of the
8 forfeiture period;
9 (b) ensure courts follow transparent and fair processes in collecting forfeitures; and
10 (c) encourage the continued engagement of surety bail bond agents in apprehending defendants
11 even after forfeiture payments are made, improving overall compliance with court orders.
12 (6) The legislature finds that for the purposes of this chapter the term "arrest", as it pertains to
13 actions by a surety bail bond insurance producer, means the physical seizure or custody of the principal for the
14 purpose of returning the principal to the jurisdiction of the court, AND THE PRINCIPAL IS IN THE SURETY BAIL BOND
15 INSURANCE PRODUCER'S CUSTODY. This type of arrest:
16 (a) is authorized under the contractual obligations of the bail agreement and applicable laws;
17 (b) does not constitute the initiation of criminal charges or enforcement of a penalty; and
18 (c) is distinct from an arrest conducted by law enforcement officers as it is limited to ensuring the
19 defendant's compliance with court orders.
20
21 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Surety bail bond insurance producer party to action -- notice. (1) In
22 a legal proceeding under this chapter involving a surety bail bond insurance producer, the producer is a party to
23 the action and has the right to participate in court proceedings related to the bond and the defendant's
24 obligations. This includes but is not limited to the following:
25 (a) the court providing documented notice to the producer of any changes in a defendant's court
26 dates and the reason for the changes;
27 (b) the location of the appearance;
28 (c) whether a forfeiture has been quashed or set aside;
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – HB 852

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0852.2
1 (d) whether a warrant for the defendant's arrest has been quashed or withdrawn; and
2 (e) notifications sent in a format requested by the producer.
3 (2) The surety bail bond insurance producer may file motions or petitions solely related to the
4 enforcement, modification, or discharge of the surety appearance bond or to challenge a forfeiture order. A
5 court shall provide timely hearings with 24 hours' notice of changes in orders or any other decision relevant to
6 the proceeding and rulings on motions or petitions submitted by producers. A court shall maintain and produce
7 on request documentation of all documents relevant to a legal proceeding under this chapter.
8
9 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Regulation of teletypes -- purpose -- administrative messaging --
10 rulemaking. (1) The use of teletypes facilitates communication between jails and detention centers, serving as
11 a tool to assist with bonding defendants held in remote or distant detention locations when physical presence is
12 impractical. This system was established to address logistical challenges, such as large bond transmittals or
13 situations in which local surety bail bond agents are temporarily unavailable. However, teletypes may not be
14 misused as a substitute for maintaining a meaningful and sufficient local presence. This section governs the
15 permitted use of teletypes to ensure efficiency, prevent system abuse, and protect the operational integrity of
16 jails and detention centers.
17 (2) To manage communication system demands effectively, detention centers are authorized to
18 establish and implement their own reasonable limits on the number of teletypes consistent with constitutional
19 rights, operational capacity, and institutional needs.
20 (3) Surety bail bond insurance producer agencies advertising as statewide providers shall maintain
21 enough licensed surety bail bond agents geographically distributed to reasonably support their claimed service
22 area. The ratio must be at least one licensed surety bail bond agent for each geographic area as determined by
23 the attorney general to qualify as a statewide provider. The agencies shall register licensed surety bail bond
24 agents in assigned regions with the attorney general, and the attorney general shall review compliance with this
25 subsection during license applications and renewals. The license application for agencies may include a fee
26 that is commensurate with the costs of administering this section.
27 (4) Jails must log and monitor teletype request from agencies and agents and report excessive or
28 abusive teletype activity to the attorney general. Jails are authorized to limit the number of simultaneous
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 852

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0852.2
1 teletypes that they will process from any single agency or agent to a reasonable amount, based on the jail's
2 capacity. The jail must provide a clear escalation process for urgent cases, ensuring teletypes are not unduly
3 delayed for defendants requiring immediate release.
4 (5) (a) To ensure compliance with this section, agencies or individuals who misuse the teletype
5 system may be subject to the penalties described in this subsection (5).
6 (i) The attorney general may impose the following fines on an agency or agent engaging in
7 excessive or abusive teletype activity, with penalties escalating for repeated offenses:
8 (A) for a first offense, a fine of up to $500 for each violation; and
9 (B) for subsequent offenses, a fine of up to $2,000 for each violation.
10 (ii) Agencies engaging in misuse of teletype activity may face temporary or permanent restrictions,
11 including:
12 (A) suspension or revocation of statewide operating claims until compliance is demonstrated; and
13 (B) limitations on the number of teletypes an agency or agent may submit within a specified
14 timeframe.
15 (b) Jails and detention centers must log and report violations to the attorney general for
16 investigation. Verified complaints of misuse may result in immediate suspension of an agency's or agent's
17 teletype privileges pending a compliance review.
18 (c) The attorney general may promulgate rules for identifying and addressing patterns of teletype
19 abuse.
20
21 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Statute of limitations for surety bonds. (1) On an action relating to a
22 surety appearance bond, the period to commence an action is 2 years. The 2-year period begins on the date
23 the bond is executed.
24 (2) The surety appearance bond must be exonerated and discharged after 2 years, regardless of
25 the status of the court case, unless otherwise agreed on by the surety bail bond agent.
26 (3) Courts may require a defendant to:
27 (a) post a new bond if the case continues beyond 2 years and the court determines that continued
28 bond security is necessary; and
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 852

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0852.2
1 (b) ensure the terms and conditions of the new bond are consistent with the original order unless
2 circumstances require adjustment.
3 (4) Courts must notify the surety bail bond agent, the defendant, and other relevant parties at least
4 30 days before the expiration of the 2-year term to allow sufficient time for renewal or other arrangements. If the
5 court fails to issue a new order or notify the parties within the specified timeframe, the bond must be considered
6 exonerated by operation of law. Notification must be delivered through certified mail, electronic notification
7 systems, or other verifiable methods.
8 (5) The intent of this section is to limit the surety's liability to a reasonable timeframe, ensure
9 fairness for all parties, and provide clear timelines for action.
10

12 "3-1-1502. Training and certification of judges. (1) Except as provided in 3-1-1503, a judge

15 prescribed by the commission.
16 (2) The training and education must include annual instruction on the statutory framework
17 governing surety appearance bonds, including legislative intent outlined in this chapter, proper procedures for
18 handling bond surrenders, forfeitures, and discharges, and the rights and responsibilities of licensed surety bail
19 bond agents in managing principals. Courts shall receive education in surety bail bond insurance producer's
20 participation in court actions as provided in [section 2]. The supreme court shall collaborate with the attorney
21 general in developing training and education as provided in 33-17-1602."
22

17 bond agents may be recorded for security purposes.

7 discharge the original bond, releasing the producer from all liability associated with the prior bond; and

11 (a) the defendant must be brought before a judge for a redetermination of bond prior to release;
12 (b) the judge may only continue the existing bond if the surety bail bond insurance producer
13 provides documented agreement to continue the bond liability; and

8 Section 12. Section 46-9-502, MCA, is amended to read:
9 "46-9-502. Conditions performed -- bail discharged. (1) When the conditions of bail have been
10 performed and the accused has been discharged from the accused's obligations in the cause, the court shall
11 return to the accused or the accused's sureties the deposit of any cash, stocks, or bonds. If the bail is real

18
19 (3) Courts are prohibited from scheduling ongoing status hearings for the purpose of monitoring
20 the payment of fines and fees as a condition of maintaining a secured surety appearance bond. If a defendant
21 fails to comply with the terms of sentencing, the court may:
22 (a) hold a contempt hearing, which allows for the issuance of a warrant; and
23 (b) set a new bond on the warrant to ensure the defendant's appearance at the contempt hearing.
24 (4) (3) When a defendant appears for a contempt hearing and satisfies the appearance and the
25 hearing is adjudicated, a surety bond issued for the defendant must be discharged and may not be used to
26 ensure continued compliance with fines, fees, or other sentencing conditions.
27 (5) (4) The intent of this section is to maintain the distinction between surety appearance bonds and
28 performance bonds and to ensure fairness to the sureties and defendants by limiting the bond's scope to

3 Section 13. Section 46-9-503, MCA, is amended to read:
4 "46-9-503. Violation of release condition -- forfeiture. (1) If a defendant violates a condition of
5 release, including failure to appear, the prosecutor may make a written motion to the court for revocation of the
6 order of release. A judge may issue a warrant for the arrest of a defendant charged with violating a condition of
7 release. Upon arrest, the defendant must be brought before a judge in accordance with 46-7-101.
8 (2) (a) If a defendant fails to appear before a court as required and bail has been posted, the judge
9 may declare the bail forfeited. Notice of the order of forfeiture must be mailed to the defendant and the
10 defendant's sureties at their last-known address within 10 working days after the defendant fails to appear or
11 the bond becomes void and must be released and returned to the surety within 5 working days. If a court fails to
12 issue a forfeiture within 10 days of the failure to appear, the bond must be automatically exonerated and
13 discharged back to the surety bail bond agent. Failure of a court to send notice within 10 days of the failure to
14 appear renders the forfeiture invalid and the bond must be discharged.
15 (b) On issuing a forfeiture, the court shall issue NOTICE OF:
16
17 (i) a warrant for the arrest of the defendant; and
18
19 (ii) deliver a copy of the warrant along with notice of forfeiture to the agent.

3 (3)(4) If at any time within 90 days after the forfeiture the defendant's sureties surrender the
4 defendant pursuant to 46-9-510 or appear and satisfactorily excuse the defendant's failure to appear, the judge
5 shall direct the forfeiture to be discharged without penalty. This 90-day period begins on the date the forfeiture
6 order is signed by the judge. Courts shall send notification of forfeiture to the surety bail bond agent within 10
7 calendar days of the failure to appear. If the notification is issued within the timeframe, the 90-day clock begins
8 regardless of when the notice is received by the surety, provided the court can document compliance with the
9 10-day notification rule. If at any time within 90 days after the forfeiture the defendant appears and satisfactorily
10 excuses the defendant's failure to appear, the judge shall direct the forfeiture to be discharged upon terms as
11 may be just. A court must notify the agent within 10 days after the 90-day forfeiture period expires if the
12 forfeiture remains unpaid. Notification under this section must:
13 (a) be served in the same manner as a notice in a civil action;
14 (b) include details of the amount owed, the court order enforcing the forfeiture, and instructions for
15 payment or further legal proceedings; and
16 (c) clearly state that the forfeiture action is now considered a civil action between the court, the
17 surety bail bond insurance producer, and the surety, with the producer recognized as a direct party to the case.
18 (5) In addition to the timeframes in subsection (4), the surety bail bond insurance producer may
19 recover forfeiture payments after payment. After payment of the forfeiture, the producer retains arrest authority
20 over the defendant for up to 1 year. If the defendant is apprehended and returned to the court's custody within
21 this period, the producer may:
22
23 (a) file a motion with the court to request a refund of the paid forfeiture amount ; and
24 (b) provide documentation providing the surrender and custody of the defendant to support the
25 refund request.
26 (4)(6) The surety bail bond must be exonerated upon on proof of the defendant's death or
27 incarceration or subjection to court-ordered treatment in a foreign jurisdiction for a period exceeding the time
28 limits under subsection (3) (4).

1 (7) If the defendant is incarcerated in a jurisdiction outside the state or in a tribal jail, the following
2 procedures apply:
3 (a) the surety bail bond insurance producer may petition the court for:
4 (i) issuance of a warrant that is enforceable in the jurisdiction where the defendant is located; or
5 (ii) discharge of the forfeiture until the defendant completes their obligations in the incarcerating
6 jurisdiction; AND
7 (b) lower jurisdictional courts must have explicit authority to facilitate the issuance of nationwide
8 warrants in cases involving surety appearance bonds, ensuring recovery of the defendant in jurisdictions
9 requiring warrants for apprehension; and
10 (c) (B) the cost of returning the defendant to the court's jurisdiction as a result of an out-of-state
11 warrant or recovery efforts initiated by the producer in a foreign or out-of-state jurisdiction falls solely on the
12 producer and not the court.
13 (5)(8) A surety bail bond is an appearance bond only. It cannot be held or forfeited for fines,
14 restitution, or violations of release conditions other than failure to appear. The original bond is in effect pursuant
15 to 46-9-121 and is due and payable only if the surety fails, after 90 days from forfeiture, to surrender the
16 defendant or if the defendant fails to appear on the defendant's own within the same time period."

12 (b) does not constitute the initiation of criminal charges or enforcement of a penalty; and
13 (c) is distinct from an arrest conducted by law enforcement officers, as it is limited to ensuring the
14 defendant's compliance with court orders."
15

69th Legislature 2025 HB0852.2

9 and bond payment to ensure the jurisdictional court can confirm the conditions of the release.
10 (6) Defendants who do not post bond must be held by the arresting county until the jurisdictional
11 county arranges for their transfer or provides alternative instructions. The arresting county may not release the
12 defendant without consent from the court of jurisdiction.
