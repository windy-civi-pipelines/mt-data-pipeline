18 amount must remain the same for that year.
19 (b) Subject to subsection (6), manufacturing machinery, fixtures, and equipment installed and
20 placed in service after December 31, 2022, are exempt or partially exempt from taxation for a period of 5 years

22 amount allowed under subsection (6)(d) is phased out at a rate of 20% of the amount allowed by the governing
23 body a year, with the property being assessed at 100% of its taxable value after a 10-year period. An entity that
24 claims a tax exemption under this subsection (4)(b) shall maintain adequate books and records demonstrating
25 the investment the owner made when installing and placing the property into service in the state. The property
26 owners shall make the records available to the department for inspection on request.

69th Legislature 2025 HB 844.1
1 (5) The gas gathering facilities of a stand-alone gas gathering company providing gas gathering
2 services to third parties on a contractual basis, owning more than 500 miles of gas gathering lines in Montana,
3 and centrally assessed in tax years prior to 2009 must be treated as a natural gas transmission pipeline subject
4 to central assessment under 15-23-101. For purposes of this subsection, the gas gathering line ownership of all
5 affiliated companies, as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 1504(a), must be
6 aggregated for purposes of determining the 500-mile threshold.
7 (6) (a) In order for a taxpayer to receive the tax abatement described in subsection (4)(b), the
8 taxpayer shall submit an application for the abatement and a project plan to the governing body and receive
9 approval pursuant to this subsection (6). For property in which a taxpayer does not seek approval prior to
10 commencing construction, the taxpayer shall apply:
11 (i) by March 1 of the year during which the abatement is first applicable for property placed in
12 service on or after October 1, 2023; or
13 (ii) by January 31, 2024, for property placed in service after December 31, 2022, and before
14 October 1, 2023.
15 (b) In order to receive an abatement, the governing body must approve the abatement request in
16 the application by resolution for each project, following due notice as provided in 7-1-2121 and a public hearing.
17 The governing body may not grant approval for the project until the applicant's property taxes have been paid in
18 full. Taxes paid under protest do not preclude approval. If a taxpayer receives approval of a tax abatement prior
19 to commencement of construction, the abatement does not extend to property that is outside the scope of the
20 project plan that was submitted to the governing body with the application.
21 (c) The purpose of the public hearing is to determine whether the manufacturing machinery,
22 fixtures, and equipment eligible for an abatement has an impact on services. The governing body shall:
23 (i) publish due notice within 60 days of receiving a taxpayer's complete application for the tax
24 abatement; and
25 (ii) conduct a public hearing regarding an application for the tax abatement and make a
26 determination whether the eligible abatement activities will have a fiscal impact to the county.
27 (d) Within 120 days of receiving the application provided for in subsection (6)(a), the governing
28 body shall issue a decision regarding whether to allow the abatement at 100%, 90%, or 80%. If the governing

3 deny the abatement and the minimum amount of the abatement may not be less than 80%."
