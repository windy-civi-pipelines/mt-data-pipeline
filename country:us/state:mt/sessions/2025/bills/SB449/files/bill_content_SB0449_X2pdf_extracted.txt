(5) Nothing in this section may require a policy to cover any care, treatment, or services for a
health condition that the terms of coverage otherwise completely excluded from the policy's covered benefits
without regard for whether the care, treatment, or services are medically necessary.
(6) No enrollee may be required to repeat a step therapy protocol if the enrollee, while under the
enrollee's current or a previous health plan, used the prescription drug required by the step therapy protocol or
another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class with a similar efficacy and side effect profile or with
the same mechanism of action and discontinued use of the drug due to lack of efficacy, effectiveness, an
adverse event, or contraindication. The enrollee's prescribing provider shall submit justification and clinical
information, if requested, that demonstrates a clinically valid reason for why the covered prescribed drug is
needed and documentation of completion of previous step therapy protocols for the prescribed drug.
(7) As used in this section, "step therapy protocol" means an evidence-based protocol or program
that establishes the specific sequence in which prescription drugs for a specified medical condition are
considered medically appropriate for a particular patient and are covered by a health insurer or health benefit
plan.

Section 3:
Section 2. Prohibition on prior authorization requirements for prescriptions written at
discharge from inpatient care. (1) A prescription written for an inpatient and patient under observation at the
time of discharge requiring a prior authorization may not be subject to prior authorization requirements and
must be immediately approved for not less than 3 days, provided that:
(a) the cost of the medication does not exceed $5,000 a day; and
(b) the physician shall note on the prescription or notify the pharmacy that the prescription is being
provided at discharge.
(2) Approval beyond 3 days is subject to prior authorization review under 33-32-212.

Section 4:
Section 3. Prohibition on retroactive denial. When prior authorization for a covered service is
required of and obtained by or on behalf of a member, the approval is final and may not be rescinded after the
covered service has been provided. This section does not apply to cases of fraud, misrepresentation,
nonpayment of premium, and exhaustion of benefits or if the member for whom the prior approval was granted

from a health care provider submitted through a secure electronic transmission as determined by the health
insurance issuer or utilization review organization.
(2) If a prior authorization for a prescription drug is submitted electronically using the national
council for prescription drug program's SCRIPT standard for electronic prior authorization transactions, then the
health insurance issuer or utilization review organization shall accept and respond to the prior authorization
request using the same SCRIPT standard for electronic prior authorization transactions.

electronically.
