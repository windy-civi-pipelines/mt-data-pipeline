a checklist devised by the department pursuant to 50-60-118 for single-family dwellings and provide to

(d) during and in the course of construction, order in writing the remedying of any condition found

city, or town building code. Orders may be served upon the owner or the owner's authorized agent personally or
by sending by certified mail a copy of the order to the owner or the owner's authorized agent at the address set
forth in the application for permission for the construction of the building. A county, city, or town certified
pursuant to 50-60-302, by action of its building official, may grant in writing time as may be reasonably
necessary for achieving compliance with the order. For the purposes of subsection (2)(a) and this subsection
(2)(d), the phrase "during and in the course of construction" refers to the construction of a building until all
necessary building permits have been obtained and all work authorized by those permits has been fully
approved by the building official having jurisdiction.

costs directly and specifically identifiable for the enforcement of building codes, plus indirect costs charged on
the same basis as other local government proprietary funds not paying administrative charges as direct
charges. If indirect costs are waived for any local government proprietary fund, they must also be waived for the
program established in this section. Indirect charges are limited to the charges that are allowed under federal
cost accounting principles that are applicable to a local government.

(ii) reduced if the amount of the fees or charges accumulates above the amount needed to enforce
building codes for 36 months. The excess must be placed in a reserve account and may be used only for
building code enforcement. Collection and expenditure of fees and charges must be fully documented.
(iii) allocated and remitted to the department, in an amount not to exceed 0.5% of the building fees
or charges collected, for the building codes education program established in 50-60-116.

enforcement program that has been certified under 50-60-302 may, within the area of its jurisdiction:
(a) make, amend, and repeal rules for the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this

Section 3:
section and for the collection of fees and charges related to construction; and

enforcement authority having jurisdiction after a showing of compliance with the requirements of the applicable
provisions of the state building code or county, city, or town building code or other county, city, or town

subsection (3) may, as part of its building code or by town ordinance or resolution, adopt voluntary energy
conservation standards for new construction for the purpose of providing incentives to encourage voluntary
energy conservation. The incentive-based energy conservation standards adopted may exceed any applicable
energy conservation standards contained in the state building code. New construction is not required to meet
local standards that exceed state energy conservation standards unless the building contractor elects to receive
a local incentive.
(4) Each Except as provided in subsection (6), each county, city, or town with a building code
enforcement program that has been certified under 50-60-302 may perform inspections of buildings that are
outside its jurisdictional limits, subject to the following conditions:
(a) The inspections are requested in writing by the owners or builders of the buildings to be
inspected.
(b) The inspections are not done in lieu of inspections by another county, city, or town that has
jurisdiction over the buildings to be inspected.

inspections.
(ii) Similar powers of building code enforcement may not be contractually created or required by

inspections of those buildings prior to annexation as a condition precedent to receiving any public services or
utilities.
(6) All buildings owned by any state agency are subject to the jurisdiction of the department for
purposes of all plan reviews, permitting, and inspections. In performing plan reviews, permitting, and
inspections, the department shall provide to affected cities, towns, and counties the building plans and an
opportunity to provide comment. The department shall notify the local jurisdictions of actions taken and transmit
to the local jurisdiction copies of final building plans."
