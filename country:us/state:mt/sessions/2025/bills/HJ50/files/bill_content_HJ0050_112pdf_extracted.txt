11 WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature commonly hears and considers legislation each session
12 regarding owners' associations; and
13 WHEREAS, the joint Local Government Interim Committee has studied owners' associations for the
14 past two legislative cycles, including learning about the makeup of owners' associations, studying our current
15 legal structure that applies to owners' associations, talking to stakeholders that work with owners' associations
16 about how to address owners' associations in Montana law, and discussing the implementation of the Uniform
17 Common Interest Ownership Act to address concerns about owners' associations; and
18 WHEREAS, during the interim committee’s work, it was discussed that the Uniform Common Interest
19 Ownership Act also addresses the Unit Ownership Act in Title 70, chapter 23, MCA, which governs
20 condominiums in Montana and has not been thoroughly amended since its adoption in 1965; and
21 WHEREAS, the laws in banking, insurance, title, real estate, and development industries have
22 significantly changed since 1965; and

25 committee identified regarding owners' associations; and
26 WHEREAS, the committee asked members of the Montana Bar Association to review and draft, with
27 input from stakeholders, the Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act, which the Local Government Interim
28 Committee would consider for possible introduction to the 69th Legislature; and

69th Legislature HJ 50.1
1 WHEREAS, the draft of the Uniform Common Ownership Act was completed after the final meeting of
2 the Local Government Interim Committee and therefore could not be considered and introduced as a committee
3 bill; and
4 WHEREAS, the Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act was introduced in the 69th Legislature as
5 House Bill No. 619 and was co-sponsored by all sitting legislators that sat on the Local Government Interim
6 Committee; and
7 WHEREAS, the House Judiciary Committee tabled House Bill No. 619 after committee members
8 argued that the bill was too large and complex to understand after one hearing and needed more review; and
9 WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of Montanans to have comprehensive and updated laws
10 governing owners' associations and condominiums.
11
12 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
13 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
14 That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
15 committee, pursuant to section 5-5-217, MCA, or direct sufficient staff resources to:

17 Legislature as House Bill No. 619, for potential implementation in Montana;
18 (2) review and analyze the current structure of Montana law, including laws governing nonprofit
19 organizations in Title 35, chapter 2, MCA, the Unit Ownership Act in Title 70, chapter 23, MCA, and other laws
20 that specifically address owners' associations; and
21 (3) determine if legislative changes are warranted to address owners' associations in Montana.
