educational program for an eligible child in the qualifying facility. The contract between the superintendent of
public instruction and a qualifying facility must include a provision requiring the qualifying facility to provide
educational data and regular reports about the academic status and academic progress being made by each
eligible child at a qualifying facility.
(3) (a) Whenever the superintendent of public instruction contracts with a qualifying facility for
provision of an educational program for an eligible child, the superintendent of public instruction shall establish
a daily rate per eligible child for each qualifying facility that reflects actual documented costs of providing an
appropriate educational opportunity at that facility and that excludes the cost of services that are eligible for
reimbursement under any provision of state or federal law or an insurance policy.
(b) For each eligible child and from appropriations provided for the purposes of this section, the
superintendent of public instruction shall pay the qualifying facility the daily rate under subsection (3)(a) minus
the amount paid under subsection (3)(c).
(c) For each eligible child, the eligible child's school district of residence shall pay the qualifying
facility a daily rate of 40% of the tuition per-ANB amount as defined in 20-5-323 divided by 180 in a manner
prescribed by the superintendent of public instruction. The district of residence shall finance the tuition amount
from the levy authorized to support the district tuition fund or from the district's general fund or any other legally
available fund in the discretion of the trustees.
(d) An eligible child whose appropriate educational opportunity is provided under subsection (5)(a)
or (5)(b) may not receive funding under this subsection (3).
(e) In preparing and submitting an agency budget pursuant to 17-7-111 and 17-7-112, the
superintendent of public instruction shall include a request for funding this section based on the daily rate for
each facility as determined under subsection (3)(a). If the money appropriated for the payments to qualifying
facilities under this section is not sufficient, the superintendent of public instruction shall request the state
budget director to submit a request for a supplemental appropriation in the second year of the biennium that is
sufficient to complete the funding of the payments.
(4) A supplemental education fee or tuition, beyond those authorized under this section, may not
be charged for an eligible child who receives an education under contract with an in-state children's psychiatric
hospital or residential treatment facility under subsection (3) or as provided under subsection (5).

two options:
(a) provide for an appropriate educational opportunity for the eligible child utilizing qualified
specialists who are employees of the office of public instruction or under contract with the office of public
instruction for the purposes of this section. The eligible child's district of residence shall reimburse the office of
public instruction at the daily rate established in subsection (3)(c). The district of residence may finance the
reimbursement from the levy authorized to support the district tuition fund.
(b) negotiate with the school district in which the qualifying facility is located for the supervision and
implementation of an appropriate educational opportunity for eligible children attending the facility. The amount
to be paid to the district of attendance by the office of public instruction and the amount to be paid by the
eligible child's district of residence are determined in the same manner as provided in 20-5-323 and 20-5-324
for out-of-district attendance agreements approved under 20-5-321(1)(d) and (1)(e).
(6) Funds provided to a district under this section, including funds received under the provisions of
20-7-420:
