9 (3) If a protested property tax or fee is payable in installments, a subsequent installment portion
10 considered unlawful by the Montana tax appeal board need not be paid and an action or suit need not be
11 commenced to recover the subsequent installment. The determination of the action or suit commenced to

14 subsequent installment not paid by the taxpayer plus interest from the date the subsequent installment was
15 due.

19 property that is centrally assessed pursuant to 15-23-101 or on industrial property that is assessed annually by
20 the department in the first and subsequent years that a tax protest remains unresolved may demand that the
21 treasurer of the county or municipality pay the requesting taxing jurisdiction all or a portion of the protest

10 to the person in whose favor the judgment is rendered the amount of the protested portions of the property tax
11 or fee that the person holding the judgment is entitled to recover, together with interest from the date of

19 fund provided for in 17-6-203 for the applicable period.

23 settlement of an appeal, the final assessed value of a property that is centrally assessed under 15-23-101 or an
24 industrial property that is annually assessed by the department is less than 75% of the department's original
25 assessed value, the governing body may demand that the state refund from the general fund the protested
26 taxes equivalent to the difference between the final determined assessed value and 75% of the original
27 assessed value.

3 taxpayer.
4 (C) The provisions of subsection (6)(d)(i)(A) do not apply to protested taxes for which the taxpayer
5 protests the classification of the property.
6 (ii) If the protest action is decided adversely to a taxing jurisdiction and the amount retained in the
7 protest fund is insufficient to refund the tax payments and costs to which the taxpayer is entitled and for which
8 local government units are responsible, the treasurer shall bill and the taxing jurisdiction shall refund to the
9 treasurer that portion of the taxpayer refund, including tax payments and costs, for which the taxing jurisdiction
10 is proratably responsible. The treasurer is not responsible for the amount required to be refunded by the state
11 treasurer as provided in subsection (6)(b).

14 and from the state general fund the amount of interest as required in subsection (6)(b). The amount refunded
15 for an adverse protested action from the centrally assessed property tax state special revenue fund may not
16 exceed the amount of protested taxes or fees required to be deposited for that action pursuant to subsections
17 (4)(b)(ii) and (4)(b)(iii). If the amount available for the adverse protested action in the centrally assessed
18 property tax state special revenue fund is insufficient to refund the tax payments to which the taxpayer is
19 entitled and for which the state is responsible, the department shall pay the remainder of the refund
20 proportionally from the state general fund and from money deposited in the state special revenue fund levied
21 pursuant to 15-10-109.
22 (e) In satisfying the requirements of subsection (6)(d), the taxing jurisdiction, including the state, is

12 Section 10. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
14 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
15 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
16 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
17 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
18 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
19 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
20 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
21 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
22 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
23 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
24 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
25 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
26 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
27 labor.
28 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any

10 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
11 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
12 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
13 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
14 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
15 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
16 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
17 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
18 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
19 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
20 following tax year.
21 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
22 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
23 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
24 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
25 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
26 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).

4 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
5 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and

7 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
8 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
9 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
10 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
11 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
12 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.

20 applicable budgeted fund of the district for the current fiscal year available and sufficient to make the debt
21 service payment on the obligation coming due in the current year. The budget of an applicable budgeted fund of
22 the district for each following year in which any portion of the principal of and interest on the obligation is due
23 must provide for payment of that principal and interest.

11 savings under energy performance contracts as defined in 90-4-1102.
12 (7) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b), the obligation must state clearly on its face that the
13 obligation is not secured by a pledge of the school district's taxing power but is payable from amounts in its
14 general fund or other legally available funds.

16 general obligation of the district.
