or agreed to have been abandoned by the approval of the appropriate association, by recording a notice of
abandonment or amendment in the office of the county clerk and recorder of the county where the development
is situated, all persons are precluded from undertaking a different interpretation or enforcement action of the
abandoned covenant, condition, or restriction against a similarly situated parcel owner in the same
development.

substantially similar to the nature and scope of the use of other parcels in the development.
