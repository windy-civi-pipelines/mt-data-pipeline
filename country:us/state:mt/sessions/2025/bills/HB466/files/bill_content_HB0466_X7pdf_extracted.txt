69th Legislature 2025 HB 466
ACT; PROVIDING AN EXEMPTION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION FOR CONSTRUCTION
AND MAINTENANCE ON STATE LAND; PROVIDING AN EXEMPTION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF
COMMERCE FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION GRANTS; AMENDING SECTION 75-1-220, MCA; AND
PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE.
WHEREAS, in 2024, the Department of Environmental Quality formed a dedicated work group to
review and facilitate numerous open public discussions about the agency’s implementation of the Montana
Environmental Policy Act;
WHEREAS, the department work group found that the definitions of certain terms in statute and rule, or
the lack of definitions, creates unnecessary confusion and challenges in the implementation of a defensible
Montana Environmental Policy Act;
WHEREAS, recommendation 3C from the department work group’s final report suggests presenting
legislation to clarify problematic terms and definitions to provide more certainty for decisionmakers,
practitioners, applicants, and the public and to reduce the need for the courts to rely on federal definitions or
case law;
WHEREAS, the department work group specifically identified the term "categorical exclusion" as
lacking a definition in statute, although it is defined in model rules;
WHEREAS, the federal government, both in rulemaking and statute, has previously adopted numerous
categorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy Act; and
WHEREAS, it is the will of the Legislature to add clarity to the Montana Environmental Policy Act by
codifying the term "categorical exclusions" to clearly provide state agencies with the authority to identify actions
that do not have a significant impact on the human environment and to exclude those actions from the Montana
Environmental Policy Act.
