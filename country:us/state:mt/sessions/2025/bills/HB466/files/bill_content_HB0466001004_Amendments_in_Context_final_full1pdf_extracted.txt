6 ADMINISTRATION FOR CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE ON STATE LAND; PROVIDING AN
7 EXEMPTION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION GRANTS;

10 WHEREAS, in 2024, the Department of Environmental Quality formed a dedicated work group to
11 review and facilitate numerous open public discussions about the agency’s implementation of the Montana
12 Environmental Policy Act;
13 WHEREAS, the department work group found that the definitions of certain terms in statute and rule, or
14 the lack of definitions, creates unnecessary confusion and challenges in the implementation of a defensible
15 Montana Environmental Policy Act;
16 WHEREAS, recommendation 3C from the department work group’s final report suggests presenting
17 legislation to clarify problematic terms and definitions to provide more certainty for decisionmakers,
18 practitioners, applicants, and the public and to reduce the need for the courts to rely on federal definitions or
19 case law;
20 WHEREAS, the department work group specifically identified the term "categorical exclusion" as
21 lacking a definition in statute, although it is defined in model rules;
22 WHEREAS, the federal government, both in rulemaking and statute, has previously adopted numerous
23 categorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy Act; and
24 WHEREAS, it is the will of the Legislature to add clarity to the Montana Environmental Policy Act by
25 codifying the term "categorical exclusions" to clearly provide state agencies with the authority to identify actions
26 that do not have a significant impact on the human environment and to exclude those actions from the Montana
27 Environmental Policy Act.
