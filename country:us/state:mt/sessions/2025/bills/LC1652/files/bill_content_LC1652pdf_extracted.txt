69th Legislature 2025 LC1652.1
1 "41-3-423. Reasonable efforts required to prevent removal of child or to return -- exemption --
2 findings -- permanency plan. (1) (a) The department shall make reasonable efforts to prevent the necessity of
3 removal of a child from the child's home and to reunify families that have been separated by the state. The
4 application for a warrant to remove a child from the child's home pursuant to [section 1] does not absolve the
5 department from the duty to make reasonable efforts to prevent the necessity of removal.
6 (b) For the purposes of this subsection (1), the term "reasonable efforts" means the department
7 shall in good faith:
8 (i) conduct a comprehensive assessment of the circumstances of the family, with a focus on safe
9 reunification as the most desirable goal. The assessment must be provided to the parents and to counsel for
10 the parents.
11 (ii) identify appropriate services and help the parents overcome barriers, including actively
12 assisting the parents in obtaining appropriate services;
13 (iii) with parental consent, identify and invite the extended family to participate in providing support
14 and services to the family and to participate in family team meetings, permanency planning, and resolution of
15 placement issues;
16 (iv) conduct or cause to be conducted a diligent search for the child's extended family members
17 and contact and consult with extended family members to provide family structure and support for the child and
18 the parents;
19 (v) offer and employ all available and culturally appropriate family preservation strategies and
20 facilitate the use of remedial and rehabilitative services;
21 (vi) take steps to keep siblings together whenever possible;
22 (vii) support regular visits with parents in the most natural setting possible, as well as trial home
23 visits with the child during any period of removal, consistent with the need to ensure the health, safety, and
24 welfare of the child;
25 (viii) identify community resources, including housing, financial, transportation, mental health,
26 substance abuse, and peer support services, and actively assist the parents or, when appropriate, the child's
27 family in utilizing and accessing the resources;
28 (ix) monitor progress and participation in services; and

69th Legislature 2025 LC1652.1
1 (x) consider alternative ways to address the needs of the parents and, when appropriate, the
2 family if the optimum services do not exist or are not available.
3 (c) In determining preservation or reunification services to be provided and in making reasonable
4 efforts at providing preservation or reunification services, the child's health and safety are of paramount
5 concern.
6 (2) Except in a proceeding subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act [or the Montana Indian
7 Child Welfare Act provided for in Title 41, chapter 3, part 13], the department may, at any time during an abuse
8 and neglect proceeding, make a request for a determination that preservation or reunification services need not
9 be provided. If an indigent parent is not already represented by counsel, the court shall immediately provide for
10 the appointment or assignment of counsel to represent the indigent parent in accordance with the provisions of
11 41-3-425. A court may make a finding that the department need not make reasonable efforts to provide
12 preservation or reunification services if the court finds that the parent has:
13 (a) subjected a child to aggravated circumstances, including but not limited to abandonment,
14 torture, chronic abuse, or sexual abuse or chronic, severe neglect of a child;
15 (b) committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited deliberate or mitigated deliberate
16 homicide of a child;
17 (c) committed aggravated assault against a child;
18 (d) committed neglect of a child that resulted in serious bodily injury or death; or
19 (e) had parental rights to the child's sibling or other child of the parent involuntarily terminated and
20 the circumstances related to the termination of parental rights are relevant to the parent's ability to adequately
21 care for the child at issue.
22 (3) Preservation or reunification services are not required for a putative father, as defined in 42-2-
23 201, if the court makes a finding that the putative father has failed to do any of the following:
24 (a) contribute to the support of the child for an aggregate period of 1 year, although able to do so;
25 (b) establish a substantial relationship with the child. A substantial relationship is demonstrated by:
26 (i) visiting the child at least monthly when physically and financially able to do so; or
27 (ii) having regular contact with the child or with the person or agency having the care and custody
28 of the child when physically and financially able to do so; and
- 27 - Authorized Print Version – ****

69th Legislature 2025 LC1652.1
1 (iii) manifesting an ability and willingness to assume legal and physical custody of the child if the
2 child was not in the physical custody of the other parent.
3 (c) register with the putative father registry pursuant to Title 42, chapter 2, part 2, and the person
4 has not been:
5 (i) adjudicated in Montana to be the father of the child for the purposes of child support; or
6 (ii) recorded on the child's birth certificate as the child's father.
7 (4) A judicial finding that preservation or reunification services are not necessary under this section
8 must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.
9 (5) If the court finds that preservation or reunification services are not necessary pursuant to
10 subsection (2) or (3), a permanency hearing must be held within 30 days of that determination and reasonable
11 efforts, including consideration of both in-state and out-of-state permanent placement options for the child, must
12 be made to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan and to complete
13 whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.
14 (6) If reasonable efforts have been made to prevent removal of a child from the home or to return a
15 child to the child's home but continuation of the efforts is determined by the court to be inconsistent with the
16 permanency plan for the child, the department shall make reasonable efforts to place the child in a timely
17 manner in accordance with the permanency plan, including, if appropriate, placement in another state, and to
18 complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child. Reasonable efforts to
19 place a child permanently for adoption or to make an alternative out-of-home permanent placement may be
20 made concurrently with reasonable efforts to return a child to the child's home. Concurrent planning, including
21 identifying in-state and out-of-state placements, may be used.
22 (7) When determining whether the department has made reasonable efforts to prevent the
23 necessity of removal of a child from the child's home or to reunify families that have been separated by the
24 state, the court shall review the services provided by the agency including, if applicable, protective services
25 provided pursuant to 41-3-302. (Bracketed language in subsection (2) terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch.

11 Section 12. Section 41-3-427, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "41-3-427. (Temporary) Petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services --
13 evidence and consideration of harm of removal -- order -- service. (1) (a) In a case in which it appears that
14 a child is abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected, the county attorney, the attorney
15 general, or an attorney hired by the county may file a petition for immediate protection and emergency
16 protective services. In implementing the policy of this section, the child's health and safety are of paramount
17 concern.
18 (b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific
19 authority requested and must be supported by an affidavit signed by a representative of the department stating
20 in detail the alleged facts upon which the request is based and the facts establishing probable cause or, if the
21 case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act provided for in
22 Title 41, chapter 3, part 13, clear and convincing evidence that a child is abused or neglected or is in danger of
23 being abused or neglected.
24 (c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
25 (i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and
26 (ii) specific, written documentation as to why the risk of allowing the child to remain at home
27 substantially outweighs the harm of removing the child, including consideration of:
28 (A) the emotional trauma the child is likely to experience if separated from the family;

69th Legislature 2025 LC1652.1
1 (B) the child's relationships with other members of the household, including siblings;

7 (d) If from the alleged facts presented in the affidavit it appears to the court that there is probable
8 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act,
9 clear and convincing evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being
10 abused and neglected, the judge shall grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by
11 subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the
12 alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
13 federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to
14 believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected, the court
15 shall dismiss the petition.
16 (e) If the parents, parent, guardian, person having physical or legal custody of the child, or attorney
17 for the child disputes the material issues of fact contained in the affidavit or the veracity of the affidavit, the
18 person may request a contested show cause hearing pursuant to 41-3-432 within 10 days following service of
19 the petition and affidavit.
20 (f) The petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must include a notice

22 parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child may have a support
23 person present during any meeting with a child protection specialist concerning emergency protective services.
24 Reasonable accommodation must be made in scheduling an in-person meeting with the child protection
25 specialist.
26 (2) Pursuant to subsection (1), if the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
27 federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence based
28 on the petition and affidavit, the court may issue an order for immediate protection of the child. The court shall

3 Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court may issue an order granting the
4 following forms of relief, which do not constitute a court-ordered treatment plan under 41-3-443:
5 (a) the right of entry by a peace officer or department worker;
6 (b) the right to place the child in temporary medical or out-of-home care, including but not limited to

14 home to allow the child to remain in the home;

17 (g) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the names and addresses of
18 extended family members who may be considered as placement options for the child who is the subject of the
19 proceeding; and
20 (h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
21 not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
22 expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
23 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
24 (3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
25 provide the court with information on:
26 (a) whether a kinship placement is available; or
27 (b) if a family foster home has been identified:

9 substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
10 but are not limited to:
11 (a) the factors identified in subsections (1)(c)(ii)(A) through (1)(c)(ii)(D); and
12 (b) whether the department made reasonable efforts, as described in subsection (1)(c)(ii)(E), to

17 (iii) the risk of allowing the child to remain in the home substantially outweighs the harm of removal.
18 (b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
19 the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
20 (6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply
21 immediately with the terms of the order and to appear before the court issuing the order on the date specified
22 for a show cause hearing. Upon a failure to comply or show cause, the court may hold the person in contempt
23 or place temporary physical custody of the child with the department until further order.

13 for purposes of notifying those relatives when a child that is related has been removed from the child's home

2 findings -- permanency plan. (1) (a) The department shall make reasonable efforts to prevent the necessity of
3 removal of a child from the child's home and to reunify families that have been separated by the state. The
4 application for a warrant to remove a child from the child's home pursuant to [section 1] does not absolve the
5 department from the duty to make reasonable efforts to prevent the necessity of removal.
6 (b) For the purposes of this subsection (1), the term "reasonable efforts" means the department
7 shall in good faith:
8 (i) conduct a comprehensive assessment of the circumstances of the family, with a focus on safe
9 reunification as the most desirable goal. The assessment must be provided to the parents and to counsel for

2 family if the optimum services do not exist or are not available.
3 (c) In determining preservation or reunification services to be provided and in making reasonable
4 efforts at providing preservation or reunification services, the child's health and safety are of paramount
5 concern.
6 (2) Except in a proceeding subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act [or the Montana Indian
7 Child Welfare Act provided for in Title 41, chapter 3, part 13], the department may, at any time during an abuse
8 and neglect proceeding, make a request for a determination that preservation or reunification services need not
9 be provided. If an indigent parent is not already represented by counsel, the court shall immediately provide for
10 the appointment or assignment of counsel to represent the indigent parent in accordance with the provisions of
11 41-3-425. A court may make a finding that the department need not make reasonable efforts to provide
12 preservation or reunification services if the court finds that the parent has:
13 (a) subjected a child to aggravated circumstances, including but not limited to abandonment,
14 torture, chronic abuse, or sexual abuse or chronic, severe neglect of a child;
15 (b) committed, aided, abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited deliberate or mitigated deliberate

21 care for the child at issue.
22 (3) Preservation or reunification services are not required for a putative father, as defined in 42-2-
23 201, if the court makes a finding that the putative father has failed to do any of the following:
24 (a) contribute to the support of the child for an aggregate period of 1 year, although able to do so;
25 (b) establish a substantial relationship with the child. A substantial relationship is demonstrated by:
26 (i) visiting the child at least monthly when physically and financially able to do so; or
27 (ii) having regular contact with the child or with the person or agency having the care and custody
28 of the child when physically and financially able to do so; and

3 (c) register with the putative father registry pursuant to Title 42, chapter 2, part 2, and the person
4 has not been:
5 (i) adjudicated in Montana to be the father of the child for the purposes of child support; or
6 (ii) recorded on the child's birth certificate as the child's father.
7 (4) A judicial finding that preservation or reunification services are not necessary under this section
8 must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.
9 (5) If the court finds that preservation or reunification services are not necessary pursuant to
10 subsection (2) or (3), a permanency hearing must be held within 30 days of that determination and reasonable
11 efforts, including consideration of both in-state and out-of-state permanent placement options for the child, must
12 be made to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan and to complete
13 whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.
14 (6) If reasonable efforts have been made to prevent removal of a child from the home or to return a
15 child to the child's home but continuation of the efforts is determined by the court to be inconsistent with the
16 permanency plan for the child, the department shall make reasonable efforts to place the child in a timely
17 manner in accordance with the permanency plan, including, if appropriate, placement in another state, and to
18 complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child. Reasonable efforts to
19 place a child permanently for adoption or to make an alternative out-of-home permanent placement may be
20 made concurrently with reasonable efforts to return a child to the child's home. Concurrent planning, including
21 identifying in-state and out-of-state placements, may be used.
22 (7) When determining whether the department has made reasonable efforts to prevent the
23 necessity of removal of a child from the child's home or to reunify families that have been separated by the
24 state, the court shall review the services provided by the agency including, if applicable, protective services
25 provided pursuant to 41-3-302. (Bracketed language in subsection (2) terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch.
