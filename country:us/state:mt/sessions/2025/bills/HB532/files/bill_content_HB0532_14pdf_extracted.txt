8 of a person convicted of a sexual offense, a sexual offender evaluator who has a license endorsement as

15 (6) The lack of a fixed residence is a factor that may be considered by the sentencing court or by
16 the department in determining the risk level to be assigned to an offender pursuant to this section.
17 (7) Upon obtaining information that indicates that a sexual offender who is required to register
18 under this part does not have a level 1, 2, or 3 designation, the offender, the attorney general, the county
19 attorney that prosecuted the offender and obtained a conviction for a sexual offense, or the county attorney for
20 the county in which the offender resides may, at any time, petition the district court that sentenced the offender
21 for a sexual offense or the district court for the judicial district in which the offender resides to designate the

23 at the petitioner's expense, or order that the results of all prior psychosexual evaluations be provided to all
24 parties. The court shall provide the offender with an opportunity for a hearing prior to designating the offender.
25 The petitioner shall provide the offender, the attorney general, and the county attorney that prosecuted the
26 offender with notice of the petition and notice of the hearing. As provided in 46-23-506(2)(d), petitions for relief
27 from registration under this part must be filed in the appropriate Montana district court. Orders or other
28 documents granting relief from registration requirements that originated in other jurisdictions are not valid in

15 (6) The lack of a fixed residence is a factor that may be considered by the sentencing court or by
16 the department in determining the risk level to be assigned to an offender pursuant to this section.
17 (7) Upon obtaining information that indicates that a sexual offender who is required to register
18 under this part does not have a level 1, 2, or 3 designation, the offender, the attorney general, the county
19 attorney that prosecuted the offender and obtained a conviction for a sexual offense, or the county attorney for
20 the county in which the offender resides may, at any time, petition the district court that sentenced the offender
21 for a sexual offense or the district court for the judicial district in which the offender resides to designate the
22 offender as level 1, 2, or 3. Upon the filing of the petition, the court may order a psychosexual evaluation report
23 at the petitioner's expense, or order that the results of all prior psychosexual evaluations be provided to all
24 parties. The court shall provide the offender with an opportunity for a hearing prior to designating the offender.
25 The petitioner shall provide the offender, the attorney general, and the county attorney that prosecuted the
26 offender with notice of the petition and notice of the hearing. As provided in 46-23-506(2)(d), petitions for relief
27 from registration under this part must be filed in the appropriate Montana district court. Orders or other
28 documents granting relief from registration requirements that originated in other jurisdictions are not valid in
