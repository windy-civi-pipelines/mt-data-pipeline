9 of a person convicted of a sexual offense, a sexual offender evaluator who has a license endorsement as
10 provided for in 37-1-139 shall provide the court with a psychosexual evaluation report recommending one of the
11 following levels of designation for the offender:
12 (a) level 1, the risk of a repeat sexual offense is low;
13 (b) level 2, the risk of a repeat sexual offense is moderate;
14 (c) level 3, the risk of a repeat sexual offense is high, there is a threat to public safety, and the
15 sexual offender evaluator believes that the offender is a sexually violent predator.

18 the offender;
19 (b) designate the offender as level 1, 2, or 3; and

22 federal government, or the department under subsection (5) that is determined by the court to be similar to level
23 2 may petition the sentencing court or the district court for the judicial district in which the offender resides to

25 phase of either the prison's sexual offender treatment program or of an equivalent program approved by the
26 department. After considering the petition, the court may change the offender's risk level designation if the court
27 finds by clear and convincing evidence that the offender's risk of committing a repeat sexual offense has
28 changed since the time sentence was imposed. The court shall impose one of the three risk levels specified in
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – HB 532

7 the federal government, the department of justice may give the offender the risk level designation assigned by

9 who are not currently under the supervision of the department or the youth court and were not given a risk level
10 designation after conviction shall provide to the department of justice all prior risk assessments and
11 psychosexual evaluations done to evaluate the offender's risk to reoffend. Any offender without a risk
12 assessment or psychosexual evaluation shall, at the offender's expense, undergo a psychosexual evaluation

14 psychosexual evaluation may be requested by the attorney general or a county attorney for purposes of
15 petitioning a district court to assign a risk level designation.
16 (6) The lack of a fixed residence is a factor that may be considered by the sentencing court or by
17 the department in determining the risk level to be assigned to an offender pursuant to this section.
18 (7) Upon obtaining information that indicates that a sexual offender who is required to register
19 under this part does not have a level 1, 2, or 3 designation, the offender, the attorney general, the county
20 attorney that prosecuted the offender and obtained a conviction for a sexual offense, or the county attorney for
21 the county in which the offender resides may, at any time, petition the district court that sentenced the offender
22 for a sexual offense or the district court for the judicial district in which the offender resides to designate the
23 offender as level 1, 2, or 3. Upon the filing of the petition, the court may order a psychosexual evaluation report
24 at the petitioner's expense, or order that the results of all prior psychosexual evaluations be provided to all
25 parties. The court shall provide the offender with an opportunity for a hearing prior to designating the offender.
26 The petitioner shall provide the offender, the attorney general, and the county attorney that prosecuted the
27 offender with notice of the petition and notice of the hearing. As provided in 46-23-506(2)(d), petitions for relief
28 from registration under this part must be filed in the appropriate Montana district court. Orders or other
