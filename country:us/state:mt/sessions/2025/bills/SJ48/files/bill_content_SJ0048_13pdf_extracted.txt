9 WHEREAS, the legalization of recreational and medical marijuana in Montana has led to evolving
10 patterns in public health, youth behavior, criminal justice, and behavioral health; and
11 WHEREAS, Montana lacks a centralized data system to track and monitor the effects of marijuana
12 legalization, limiting the ability of policymakers and communities to respond effectively; and

14 increased risks of psychosis, depression, anxiety, and cannabis use disorder, particularly among youth and
15 individuals with mental health vulnerabilities; and
16 WHEREAS, schools, emergency departments, behavioral health providers, treatment centers,
17 community coalitions, and law enforcement have called for better data to inform prevention, treatment, and
18 public safety strategies; and
19 WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature has a responsibility to ensure that marijuana policy protects
20 youth, promotes public safety, and supports access to treatment.
21
22 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
23 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
24 That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
25 committee, pursuant to section 5-5-217, MCA, to conduct a narrowly focused interim study on the public health
26 and safety impacts of marijuana legalization in Montana. The study must examine, at a minimum:

1 (2) youth marijuana use and its impact on academic achievement and the school environment,
2 including academic performance, absenteeism, behavioral issues, and disciplinary actions;
3 (3) impacts of marijuana use on the criminal justice system, including arrests, citations, driving

6 (4) demand for substance use disorder treatment services and the capacity of the behavioral
7 health system to respond;
8 (5) the prevalence and treatment of marijuana-associated mental health disorders, including
9 cannabis-induced psychosis, depression, suicidality, and anxiety; and
10 (6) gaps in current data collection.

16 collaborative and inclusive study process; and
17 (2) use objective, data-driven, and nonpartisan analysis, free from industry or political influence.
18 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that on completion of the study, the committee compile the findings into
19 a comprehensive report to inform future policy. The report must include, at a minimum:
20 (1) a summary of data and stakeholder input;
