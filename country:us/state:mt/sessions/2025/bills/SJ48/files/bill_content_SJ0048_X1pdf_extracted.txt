69th Legislature 2025 SJ 48
MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACTS OF
MARIJUANA LEGALIZATION; AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE
REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, the legalization of recreational and medical marijuana in Montana has led to evolving
patterns in public health, youth behavior, criminal justice, and behavioral health; and
WHEREAS, Montana lacks a centralized data system to track and monitor the effects of marijuana
legalization, limiting the ability of policymakers and communities to respond effectively; and
WHEREAS, high-potency marijuana products remain legally available and have been linked to
increased risks of psychosis, depression, anxiety, and cannabis use disorder, particularly among youth and
individuals with mental health vulnerabilities; and
WHEREAS, schools, emergency departments, behavioral health providers, treatment centers,
community coalitions, and law enforcement have called for better data to inform prevention, treatment, and
public safety strategies; and
WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature has a responsibility to ensure that marijuana policy protects
youth, promotes public safety, and supports access to treatment.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
committee, pursuant to section 5-5-217, MCA, to conduct a narrowly focused interim study on the public health
and safety impacts of marijuana legalization in Montana. The study must examine, at a minimum:

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 48
(1) emergency room and urgent care trends related to marijuana and high-potency
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) product use, including psychosis, accidental ingestion, and other health effects;
(2) youth marijuana use and its impact on academic achievement and the school environment,
including academic performance, absenteeism, behavioral issues, and disciplinary actions;
(3) impacts of marijuana use on the criminal justice system, including arrests, citations, driving
under the influence, collisions that involve impaired driving due to marijuana use, and court filings involving
marijuana;
(4) demand for substance use disorder treatment services and the capacity of the behavioral
health system to respond;
(5) the prevalence and treatment of marijuana-associated mental health disorders, including
cannabis-induced psychosis, depression, suicidality, and anxiety; and
(6) gaps in current data collection.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the study:
(1) engage stakeholders, including schools and school-based health staff, student resource
officers, behavioral health and substance use professionals, law enforcement, emergency departments and
primary care professionals, public health officials, law enforcement and justice system stakeholders, tribal
nations and tribal health representatives, and local government leaders and community coalitions, to ensure a
collaborative and inclusive study process; and
(2) use objective, data-driven, and nonpartisan analysis, free from industry or political influence.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that on completion of the study, the committee compile the findings into
a comprehensive report to inform future policy. The report must include, at a minimum:
(1) a summary of data and stakeholder input;
(2) gaps in policy and data collection identified by the study;
(3) recommendations and proposed strategies to improve statewide marijuana policy and the
collection, tracking, coordination, and reporting of data related to marijuana and its use in the state; and
(4) proposed legislative or regulatory strategies to improve prevention, treatment access, youth
protection, and public safety.
