5 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT CREATING RESTRICTIONS ON THE CLOSURE OF MULE DEER
6 BUCK HUNTING DURING THE GENERAL RIFLE SEASON IN NOVEMBER; AND AMENDING SECTION 87-
7 1-304, MCA.”
8
9 WHEREAS, to increase populations of mule deer, doe harvest is minimized, and to decrease
10 populations of mule deer, doe harvest is maximized; and
11 WHEREAS, mule deer buck harvest is generally not a major factor for population management; and
12 WHEREAS, Montana is unusual among the states in that it has always allowed the harvest of mule
13 deer bucks during the deer rut period; and
14 WHEREAS, harvesting mule deer bucks during the rut gives hunters the opportunity to harvest a
15 mature deer as the mature deer are more active at that time; and
16 WHEREAS, Montana hunters have longstanding personal and family traditions of hunting mule deer
17 during the rut; and
18 WHEREAS, Montana has hunting families whose traditions of hunting mule deer during the rut are
19 generational and culminate with Thanksgiving; and
20 WHEREAS, it is essential to preserve the longstanding opportunity and tradition of mule deer buck
21 harvest during the rut period while allowing the management of buck harvest in hunting districts where it may
22 be beneficial for population management.

15 animals are causing damage to private property or when a written complaint of damage has been filed with the
