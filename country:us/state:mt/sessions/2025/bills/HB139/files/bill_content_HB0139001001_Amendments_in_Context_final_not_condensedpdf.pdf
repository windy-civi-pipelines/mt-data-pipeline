5 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT CREATING RESTRICTIONS ON THE CLOSURE OF MULE DEER
6 BUCK HUNTING DURING THE GENERAL RIFLE SEASON IN NOVEMBER; AND AMENDING SECTION 87-
7 1-304, MCA.”
8
9 WHEREAS, to increase populations of mule deer, doe harvest is minimized, and to decrease
10 populations of mule deer, doe harvest is maximized; and
11 WHEREAS, mule deer buck harvest is generally not a major factor for population management; and
12 WHEREAS, Montana is unusual among the states in that it has always, apart from the early 1900s,
13 allowed the harvest of mule deer bucks during the deer rut period; and
14 WHEREAS, harvesting mule deer bucks during the rut gives hunters the opportunity to harvest a
15 mature deer as the mature deer are more active at that time; and
16 WHEREAS, Montana hunters have longstanding personal and family traditions of hunting mule deer
17 during the rut; and
18 WHEREAS, Montana has hunting families whose traditions of hunting mule deer during the rut are
19 generational and culminate with Thanksgiving; and
20 WHEREAS, it is essential to preserve the longstanding opportunity and tradition of mule deer buck
21 harvest during the rut period while allowing the management of buck harvest in hunting districts where it may
22 be beneficial for population management.
23
24 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
25
26 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Short title. [This act] may be cited as the "November Mule Deer Hunt
27 Protection Act".

2 Section 2. Section 87-1-304, MCA, is amended to read:
3 "87-1-304. Fixing of seasons and bag and possession limits. (1) Subject to the provisions of 87-5-
4 302 and subsections (7) through (9) (10) of this section, the commission may:
5 (a) fix seasons, bag limits, possession limits, and season limits;
6 (b) open or close or shorten or lengthen seasons on any species of game, bird, fish, or fur-bearing
7 animal as defined by 87-2-101;
8 (c) declare areas open to the hunting of deer, antelope, elk, moose, sheep, goat, mountain lion,
9 bear, wild buffalo or bison, and wolf by persons holding an archery stamp and the required license, permit, or
10 tag and designate times when only bows and arrows may be used to hunt deer, antelope, elk, moose, sheep,
11 goat, mountain lion, bear, wild buffalo or bison, and wolf in those areas;
12 (d) subject to the provisions of 87-1-301(6), restrict areas and species to hunting with only
13 specified hunting arms, including bow and arrow, for the reasons of safety or of providing diverse hunting
14 opportunities and experiences; and
15 (e) declare areas open to special license holders only and issue special licenses in a limited
16 number when the commission determines, after proper investigation, that a special season is necessary to
17 ensure the maintenance of an adequate supply of game birds, fish, or animals or fur-bearing animals. The
18 commission may declare a special season and issue special licenses when game birds, animals, or fur-bearing
19 animals are causing damage to private property or when a written complaint of damage has been filed with the
20 commission by the owner of that property. In determining to whom special licenses must be issued, the
21 commission may, when more applications are received than the number of animals to be killed, award permits
22 to those chosen under a drawing system. The procedures used for awarding the permits from the drawing
23 system must be determined by the commission.
24 (2) The commission may adopt rules governing the use of livestock and vehicles by archers during
25 special archery seasons.
26 (3) Subject to the provisions of 87-5-302 and subsection (7) of this section, the commission may
27 divide the state into fish and game districts and create fish, game, or fur-bearing animal districts throughout the

1 state. The commission may declare a closed season for hunting, fishing, or trapping in any of those districts
2 and later may open those districts to hunting, fishing, or trapping.
3 (4) The commission may declare a closed season on any species of game, fish, game birds, or fur-
4 bearing animals threatened with undue depletion from any cause. The commission may close any area or
5 district of any stream, public lake, or public water or portions thereof to hunting, trapping, or fishing for limited
6 periods of time when necessary to protect a recently stocked area, district, water, spawning waters, spawn-
7 taking waters, or spawn-taking stations or to prevent the undue depletion of fish, game, fur-bearing animals,
8 game birds, and nongame birds. The commission may open the area or district upon consent of a majority of

16 (7) In an area immediately adjacent to a national park, the commission may not:
17 (a) prohibit the hunting or trapping of wolves; or
18 (b) close the area to wolf hunting or trapping unless a wolf harvest quota established by the
19 commission for that area has been met.
20 (8) The commission may authorize a wolf trapping season that opens the first Monday after
21 Thanksgiving and closes March 15 of the following calendar year, except that the commission may adjust the
22 dates for specific wolf management units based on regional recommendations.
23 (9) There is established a special muzzleloader heritage hunting season that begins on the second
24 Saturday after the end of the regular season and lasts 9 days. During this season, subject to the provisions of
25 87-6-401(1)(i) and rules adopted by the commission, a person may take a deer or elk with a valid license or
26 permit using plain lead projectiles and a muzzleloading rifle that is charged with loose black powder, loose
27 pyrodex, or an equivalent loose black powder substitute and ignited by a flintlock, wheel lock, matchlock, or
