69th Legislature 2025 LC2591.1
1 meets the requirements of this section is eligible for an exemption as provided in this section. The value of rent-
2 restricted units of eligible affordable multifamily rental housing is fully exempt in the first year, and, subject to
3 15-10-420, each year afterward the taxable percentage must be increased by 11% until the full taxable value is
4 attained in the 10th year. In subsequent years, the property must be taxed at 100% of its taxable value unless
5 the taxpayer reapplies for and is granted a new abatement. The exemption applies only to the value of eligible
6 improvements and excludes the land value.
7 (3) (a) In order for a taxpayer to receive the tax benefits described in subsection (2), the taxpayer
8 may submit an application with a project plan and receive approval for an abatement prior to construction. A
9 taxpayer that does not seek approval prior to commencing construction shall apply by March 1 of the year
10 during which the benefit is first applicable. The governing body of the county or the incorporated city or town in
11 which the affordable multifamily rental housing is located shall approve the abatement by separate resolution
12 for each property, following due notice as provided in 7-1-2121 if a county or 7-1-4127 if an incorporated city or
13 town and a public hearing. The governing body may not grant approval for the exemption until all of the
14 applicant's taxes have been paid in full. Taxes paid under protest do not preclude approval. If a taxpayer
15 receives approval of a tax abatement prior to commencement of construction, the abatement does not extend
16 to property that is outside the scope of the project plan that was submitted to the governing body with the
17 application.
18 (b) The governing body shall:
19 (i) publish due notice within 60 days of receiving a taxpayer's complete application for the tax
20 treatment provided for in this section;
21 (ii) request a determination as to whether the project plan qualifies as affordable multifamily rental
22 housing from the county housing authority or municipal housing authority as applicable or, if there is no county
23 housing authority or municipal housing authority, from county or municipal staff; and
24 (iii) conduct a public hearing regarding an application for the tax treatment provided for in this
25 section and deny or approve it within 120 days of receiving the application as provided in subsection (3)(a).
26 (c) If the governing body fails to hold a hearing or deny or approve the application within 120 days
27 of receiving the application, the applicant may seek from the district court in the jurisdiction in which the county,
28 city, or town is located a writ of mandamus to compel the governing body to make a determination.
