1 under [section 1], a part, or an accessory for a new motor vehicle or any other commodity that has not been
2 ordered by the new motor vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer;
3 (ii) participate in or contribute to any local, regional, or national advertising fund or to participate in
4 or to contribute to contests, giveaways, or other sales devices;
5 (iii) change location of the dealership or to make substantial alterations to the use or number of
6 franchises or the dealership premises or facilities;
7 (iv) either establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display space or to abandon an
8 existing franchise relationship with another manufacturer in order to keep or enter into a franchise agreement or
9 to participate in any program discount, credit, rebate, or sales incentive;
10 (v) subject to subsection (2)(b) and notwithstanding the terms of a franchise agreement or other
11 agreement providing otherwise, purchase or utilize goods or services, including electronic services such as
12 websites, data management or storage systems, digital retail platforms, software, or other digital services or
13 platforms, from a vendor, or contract with or engage any vendor identified, selected, or designated by a
14 manufacturer, a factory branch, a distributor, a distributor branch, an importer, or an affiliate of the persons or
15 entities listed without allowing the franchisee, after consultation with the franchisor, to obtain goods or services
16 of like kind, quality, and design from a vendor that the franchisee chooses, so long as the goods or services
17 comply with the franchisor's reasonable standards or requirements. It is a violation of this section for a
18 manufacturer, a factory branch, a distributor, a distributor branch, an importer, or an affiliate of the persons or
19 entities listed to coerce a franchisee to purchase or utilize certain goods or services by the withholding of any
20 benefit, including monetary incentives and vehicle allocation the dealer is otherwise eligible to receive. Nothing
21 in this provision prohibits a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or affiliate of the
22 persons or entities listed from establishing any program discount, credit, rebate, or incentive that is conditioned
23 on a new motor vehicle dealer's purchase or use of such goods or services.
24 (vi) require, coerce, or attempt to coerce a new motor vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor
25 vehicle dealer to refrain from participation in the management of, investment in, or acquisition of any other line-
26 make of new motor vehicle or related products, as long as the new motor vehicle dealer or transferee of a new
27 motor vehicle dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each franchise and the new motor vehicle dealer
28 or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer remains in substantial compliance with reasonable facilities

1 requirements. The reasonable facilities requirements may not include any requirement that a new motor vehicle
2 dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or
3 display space.
4 (vii) refrain from participation in the management of, investment in, or acquisition of any other line of
5 new motor vehicle or related products if the new motor vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle
6 dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of new motor vehicles and remains in
7 compliance with any reasonable capital standards and facility requirements of the manufacturer; or
8 (viii) enter into an agreement with a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch,
9 importer, or any representative of any of these persons or entities or do any other act unfair to the new motor
10 vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer by:
11 (A) withholding or threatening to withhold any incentive payments in whole or in part or denying or
12 threatening to deny the dealer the right to participate in an incentive program in which more than one dealer of
13 the line-make in this state is eligible to participate and on the same terms. Nothing contained in this subsection
14 (1)(a)(viii)(A) requires that a dealer be qualified by a manufacturer or distributor for incentive payments or the
15 right to payments or benefits from an incentive program and a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor,
16 distributor branch, or importer may not be prohibited from informing a dealer of this, unless the dealer meets the
17 qualifications, requirements, and standards for payment or benefits reasonably established by the
18 manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer. If the new motor vehicle dealer has
19 otherwise submitted a claim substantially complying with the qualifications, requirements, and standards of the
20 manufacturer, factory brand, distributor, distributor branch, or importer, a manufacturer, factory branch,
21 distributor, distributor branch, or importer may not deny an incentive payment or benefit claim based solely on a
22 dealer's incidental failure to comply with a specific processing requirement, such as a clerical error or other
23 administrative technicality that does not put into question the legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for
24 such an incidental requirement, the new motor vehicle dealer may correct or complete and resubmit a
25 previously submitted incentive claim for a period of up to 60 days following the new motor vehicle dealer's
26 receipt of first notice of the failure. A manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer is
27 not required to approve any such incentive claim if all material claim processing requirements are not
28 substantially complied with by the new motor vehicle dealer within the time periods prescribed by this section.

5 parts or supplies ordered by the new motor vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer from the

7 these persons or entities;
8 (b) delay, refuse, or fail to deliver or offer to deliver new motor vehicles or new vehicle parts in a
9 reasonable time and in a reasonable quantity taking into consideration the number of new motor vehicles or
10 parts reasonably available for allocation and considering the new motor vehicle dealer's or transferee of a new
11 motor vehicle dealer's facilities, the dealer's historical selling pattern, and the dealer's sales potential in the
12 dealer's relevant market area after accepting an order for any new vehicles or parts as are covered by the
13 franchise from a new motor vehicle dealer having a franchise for the retail sale of any new vehicle or parts
14 covered by the franchise if the new motor vehicle or part is publicly advertised as being available for immediate
15 delivery or actually being delivered by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or
16 importer provided the new motor vehicle dealer meets any reasonable standards or requirements established
17 by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer related to the new motor vehicle
18 or part. This subsection (1)(b) is not violated if the failure is caused by a force majeure beyond the control of the
19 manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer, provided that a manufacturer, factory
20 branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer may not establish a minimum sales requirement for
21 determining a new motor vehicle dealer's compliance with the franchise that fails to take into consideration the
22 number of new motor vehicles or parts delivered or offered to be delivered to the dealer in the applicable time
23 period.
24 (c) impose unreasonable restrictions on the assertion of legal or equitable rights on the new motor
25 vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer or franchise of a new motor vehicle dealer or
26 transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer regarding transfer; sale; right to renew; termination; discipline;
27 noncompetition covenants; site control, whether by sublease, collateral pledge of lease, or otherwise; or
28 compliance with subjective standards;

5 (i) maintains a website or other electronic or digital means of communication for negotiating
6 binding terms of sale or leasing of new motor vehicles directly with the retail buyer or lessee on prices or other
7 substantive terms of sale or leasing of new vehicles, provided that a manufacturer or distributor may maintain a
8 website or other electronic or digital means of communication that does not involve negotiating binding terms of
9 sale or leasing of new motor vehicles directly with the retail buyer or lessee on prices or other substantive terms
10 of sale or leasing of new vehicles;
11 (ii) retains ownership of new motor vehicles until they are sold or leased to the retail buyer or
12 lessee. However, a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer may maintain a
13 common supply of new vehicles of which it maintains ownership until vehicles are sold to dealers from which
14 more than one dealer may buy vehicles provided that the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor
15 branch, or importer may not use the common supply of new vehicles to engage in the negotiation of binding
16 terms of sales or leases directly with a retail buyer or lessee.
17 (iii) except for the sale or lease of a vehicle to a bona fide employee of a manufacturer, factory

23 are not considered negotiating.
24 (v) reserves the right to offer or negotiate directly with the retail buyer or lessee at the time of sale
25 in connection with the sale of a new motor vehicle sale of a service contract, vehicle maintenance agreement,

4 right to unilaterally amend or modify the agreement is void.
5 (f) notwithstanding the terms, provisions, or conditions of any agreement or franchise, use or
6 consider the new motor vehicle dealer's or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer's performance relating to
7 the sale of new motor vehicles or ability to satisfy any minimum sales or market share quota or responsibility

19 to grant a right of option to a manufacturer, distributor, or manufacturer's representative.
20 (2) (a) There is no violation of subsection (1)(a)(iii) or (1)(b) if a failure on the part of the
21 manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer is beyond the control of the listed
22 persons or entities.

7 remedies under 61-4-215 and 61-4-216 and file with the department and serve upon the respondent a petition
8 to determine whether good cause exists for permitting the proposed modification. Multiple complaints pertaining
9 to the same proposed modification may be consolidated for hearing. The proposed modification may not take
10 effect pending the determination of any protest filed by a dealer.
11 (d) (i) In making a determination of whether there is good cause for permitting a proposed
12 modification of a dealer franchise agreement, including but not limited to a dealer's relevant market area, the
13 burden of proof is on the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch or importer, except that the
14 burden of proof with regard to the factor set forth in subsection (2)(d)(i)(C) is on the dealer. The department

2 (C) the growth or decline in population, density of population, and new car registrations in the
3 relevant market area and the market as a whole;
4 (D) the presence or absence of natural geographical obstacles or boundaries;
5 (E) the proximity of census tracts or other geographic units used by the affected manufacturer,

12 distributor branch, or importer may engage in fleet sales with a fleet customer that has a designation as such by

1 requirements. The reasonable facilities requirements may not include any requirement that a new motor vehicle
2 dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or
3 display space.
4 (vii) refrain from participation in the management of, investment in, or acquisition of any other line of
5 new motor vehicle or related products if the new motor vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle
6 dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of new motor vehicles and remains in
7 compliance with any reasonable capital standards and facility requirements of the manufacturer; or
8 (viii) enter into an agreement with a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch,
9 importer, or any representative of any of these persons or entities or do any other act unfair to the new motor
10 vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer by:
11 (A) withholding or threatening to withhold any incentive payments in whole or in part or denying or
12 threatening to deny the dealer the right to participate in an incentive program in which more than one dealer of
13 the line-make in this state is eligible to participate and on the same terms. Nothing contained in this subsection
14 (1)(a)(viii)(A) requires that a dealer be qualified by a manufacturer or distributor for incentive payments or the
15 right to payments or benefits from an incentive program and a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor,
16 distributor branch, or importer may not be prohibited from informing a dealer of this, unless the dealer meets the
17 qualifications, requirements, and standards for payment or benefits reasonably established by the
18 manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer. If the new motor vehicle dealer has
19 otherwise submitted a claim substantially complying with the qualifications, requirements, and standards of the
20 manufacturer, factory brand, distributor, distributor branch, or importer, a manufacturer, factory branch,
21 distributor, distributor branch, or importer may not deny an incentive payment or benefit claim based solely on a
22 dealer's incidental failure to comply with a specific processing requirement, such as a clerical error or other
23 administrative technicality that does not put into question the legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for
24 such an incidental requirement, the new motor vehicle dealer may correct or complete and resubmit a
25 previously submitted incentive claim for a period of up to 60 days following the new motor vehicle dealer's
26 receipt of first notice of the failure. A manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer is
27 not required to approve any such incentive claim if all material claim processing requirements are not
28 substantially complied with by the new motor vehicle dealer within the time periods prescribed by this section.

3 new motor vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer; or
4 (C) threatening to withhold, delay, or disrupt the receipt of new motor vehicles or any motor vehicle
5 parts or supplies ordered by the new motor vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer from the

10 parts reasonably available for allocation and considering the new motor vehicle dealer's or transferee of a new
11 motor vehicle dealer's facilities, the dealer's historical selling pattern, and the dealer's sales potential in the
12 dealer's relevant market area after accepting an order for any new vehicles or parts as are covered by the
13 franchise from a new motor vehicle dealer having a franchise for the retail sale of any new vehicle or parts
14 covered by the franchise if the new motor vehicle or part is publicly advertised as being available for immediate
15 delivery or actually being delivered by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or
16 importer provided the new motor vehicle dealer meets any reasonable standards or requirements established
17 by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer related to the new motor vehicle
18 or part. This subsection (1)(b) is not violated if the failure is caused by a force majeure beyond the control of the
19 manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer, provided that a manufacturer, factory
20 branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer may not establish a minimum sales requirement for
21 determining a new motor vehicle dealer's compliance with the franchise that fails to take into consideration the
22 number of new motor vehicles or parts delivered or offered to be delivered to the dealer in the applicable time
23 period.
24 (c) impose unreasonable restrictions on the assertion of legal or equitable rights on the new motor
25 vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer or franchise of a new motor vehicle dealer or
26 transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer regarding transfer; sale; right to renew; termination; discipline;

7 remedies under 61-4-215 and 61-4-216 and file with the department and serve upon the respondent a petition
8 to determine whether good cause exists for permitting the proposed modification. Multiple complaints pertaining
9 to the same proposed modification may be consolidated for hearing. The proposed modification may not take
10 effect pending the determination of any protest filed by a dealer.
11 (d) (i) In making a determination of whether there is good cause for permitting a proposed
12 modification of a dealer franchise agreement, including but not limited to a dealer's relevant market area, the
13 burden of proof is on the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch or importer, except that the
14 burden of proof with regard to the factor set forth in subsection (2)(d)(i)(C) is on the dealer. The department

2 (C) the growth or decline in population, density of population, and new car registrations in the
3 relevant market area and the market as a whole;
4 (D) the presence or absence of natural geographical obstacles or boundaries;
5 (E) the proximity of census tracts or other geographic units used by the affected manufacturer,
6 factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer in determining the same line-make dealers' respective
7 relevant market area; and
8 (F) the reasonableness of the change or proposed change to the dealer's relevant market area,
9 considering the benefits and harm to the petitioning dealer, other same line-make dealers, and the
10 manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer.

20 Montana. This prohibition includes any dealership of a new line-make established by a manufacturer, factory
21 branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer or a subsidiary or a company affiliated through ownership of
22 the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer of at least 25% of the equity of the
