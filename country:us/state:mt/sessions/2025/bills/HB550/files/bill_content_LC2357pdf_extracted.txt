10 agreement providing otherwise, purchase or utilize goods or services, including electronic services such as
11 websites, data management or storage systems, digital retail platforms, software, or other digital services or
12 platforms, from a vendor, or contract with or engage any vendor identified, selected, or designated by a

15 of like kind, quality, and design from a vendor that the franchisee chooses, so long as the goods or services
16 comply with the franchisor's reasonable standards or requirements. It is a violation of this section for a
17 manufacturer, a factory branch, a distributor, a distributor branch, an importer, or an affiliate of the persons or
18 entities listed to coerce a franchisee to purchase or utilize certain goods or services by the withholding of any
19 benefit, including monetary incentives and vehicle allocation the dealer is otherwise eligible to receive. Nothing

22 on a new motor vehicle dealer's purchase or use of such goods or services.
23 (vi) require, coerce, or attempt to coerce a new motor vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor
24 vehicle dealer to refrain from participation in the management of, investment in, or acquisition of any other line-
25 make of new motor vehicle or related products, as long as the new motor vehicle dealer or transferee of a new
26 motor vehicle dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each franchise and the new motor vehicle dealer
27 or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer remains in substantial compliance with reasonable facilities
28 requirements. The reasonable facilities requirements may not include any requirement that a new motor vehicle

69th Legislature 2025 LC 2357
1 dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or
2 display space.
3 (vii) refrain from participation in the management of, investment in, or acquisition of any other line of
4 new motor vehicle or related products if the new motor vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle
5 dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of new motor vehicles and remains in
6 compliance with any reasonable capital standards and facility requirements of the manufacturer; or
7 (viii) enter into an agreement with a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch,
8 importer, or any representative of any of these persons or entities or do any other act unfair to the new motor
9 vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer by:
10 (A) withholding or threatening to withhold any incentive payments in whole or in part or denying or
11 threatening to deny the dealer the right to participate in an incentive program in which more than one dealer of

13 (1)(a)(viii)(A) requires that a dealer be qualified by a manufacturer or distributor for incentive payments or the
14 right to payments or benefits from an incentive program and a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor,
15 distributor branch, or importer may not be prohibited from informing a dealer of this, unless the dealer meets the
16 qualifications, requirements, and standards for payment or benefits reasonably established by the
17 manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer. If the new motor vehicle dealer has
18 otherwise submitted a claim substantially complying with the qualifications, requirements, and standards of the
19 manufacturer, factory brand, distributor, distributor branch, or importer, a manufacturer, factory branch,
20 distributor, distributor branch, or importer may not deny an incentive payment or benefit claim based solely on a
21 dealer's incidental failure to comply with a specific processing requirement, such as a clerical error or other
22 administrative technicality that does not put into question the legitimacy of the claim. If a claim is rejected for
23 such an incidental requirement, the new motor vehicle dealer may correct or complete and resubmit a
24 previously submitted incentive claim for a period of up to 60 days following the new motor vehicle dealer's
25 receipt of first notice of the failure. A manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer is
26 not required to approve any such incentive claim if all material claim processing requirements are not
27 substantially complied with by the new motor vehicle dealer within the time periods prescribed by this section.

4 parts or supplies ordered by the new motor vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer from the
5 manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, importer, or any representative or agent of any of
6 these persons or entities;
7 (b) delay, refuse, or fail to deliver or offer to deliver new motor vehicles or new vehicle parts in a
8 reasonable time and in a reasonable quantity taking into consideration the number of new motor vehicles or
9 parts reasonably available for allocation and considering the new motor vehicle dealer's or transferee of a new
10 motor vehicle dealer's facilities, the dealer's historical selling pattern, and the dealer's sales potential in the
11 dealer's relevant market area after accepting an order for any new vehicles or parts as are covered by the
12 franchise from a new motor vehicle dealer having a franchise for the retail sale of any new vehicle or parts
13 covered by the franchise if the new motor vehicle or part is publicly advertised as being available for immediate
14 delivery or actually being delivered by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or
15 importer provided the new motor vehicle dealer meets any reasonable standards or requirements established
16 by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer related to the new motor vehicle
17 or part. This subsection (1)(b) is not violated if the failure is caused by a force majeure beyond the control of the
18 manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer, provided that a manufacturer, factory
19 branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer may not establish a minimum sales requirement for
20 determining a new motor vehicle dealer's compliance with the franchise that fails to take into consideration the
21 number of new motor vehicles or parts delivered or offered to be delivered to the dealer in the applicable time
22 period.
23 (c) impose unreasonable restrictions on the assertion of legal or equitable rights on the new motor
24 vehicle dealer or transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer or franchise of a new motor vehicle dealer or
25 transferee of a new motor vehicle dealer regarding transfer; sale; right to renew; termination; discipline;
26 noncompetition covenants; site control, whether by sublease, collateral pledge of lease, or otherwise; or

11 distributor branch, or importer may engage in fleet sales with a fleet customer that has a designation as such by
12 the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or importer because it has purchased or has
13 committed to purchase five or more vehicles under the fleet program.
