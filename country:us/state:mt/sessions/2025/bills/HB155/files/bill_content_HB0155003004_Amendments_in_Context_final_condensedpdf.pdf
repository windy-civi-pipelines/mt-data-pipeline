1 adjust downward when taxable value increases to comply with 15-10-420 revenue limitations. This floating mill
2 levy concept lowers the number of mills levied when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
3 property taxes. However, when mill levies are fixed and property values increase, property taxes are not
4 mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy. Consequently, fixed mill levies prevent the
5 legislature from exercising the power to tax in a manner that is fair and consistent for all taxpayers in the state.
6 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
7 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
8 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5(1), of the Montana constitution to adopt,
9 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
10 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
11 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
12 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
13 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
14 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
15 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
16 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
17 for primary residences in a consistent manner, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
18 These statutory provisions do not preempt, limit or otherwise modify city charter provisions establishing
19 executive, legislative, or administrative structures in accordance with Article XI, section 5(3), of the Montana
20 constitution.
21 (3) Commencing in fiscal year 2026, the provisions of 15-10-420 apply to and are controlling for all
22 self-governing local government units, and any mill levy limits set forth in a self-governing local government’s
23 charter are null and void.
24 (4) Local governments with a voted mill levy authorized as a specific number of mills prior to [the
25 effective date of this act] may, starting in fiscal year 2026, levy the number of mills each successive fiscal year
26 that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 for the voted mill levy until the
27 taxable value of the local government equals or exceeds the taxable value in fiscal year 2025, then levy the
