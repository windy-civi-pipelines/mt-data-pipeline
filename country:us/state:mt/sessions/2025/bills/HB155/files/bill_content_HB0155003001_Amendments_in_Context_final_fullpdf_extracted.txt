2 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
3 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments have transitioned to mill levies that
4 adjust downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically
5 lowers the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases
6 in property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
7 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
8 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
9 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
10 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
11 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
12 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
13 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
14 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
15 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
16 of Initiative 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999. Given the
17 significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the last 5
18 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates for
19 primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
20 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
21 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter may levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will
22 generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, as provided in 15-10-420, including the
23 statutory increases allowed by 15-10-420, without amending or revising the charter. A local government that
24 elects to transition to a mill levy calculation limit under 15-10-420 for fiscal year 2026 is limited to levying the
25 number of mills allowed by 15-10-420, including statutory increases for subsequent fiscal years after fiscal year
26 2026, until the local government charter is amended, revised, or abandoned.
27 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
28 was authorized by the voters after December 31, 2019, may levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will

2 10-420, including the statutory increases allowed by 15-10-420, without receiving voter authorization. A local
3 government that elects to transition to a revenue-based mill levy calculation limit under 15-10-420 for fiscal year
4 2026 is limited to levying the number of mills allowed by 15-10-420, including statutory increases for
5 subsequent fiscal years after fiscal year 2026, until the expiration of the specific levy or revisions through a mill
6 levy election under the provisions of 15-10-425.
