16 surface area of at least 160 acres for at least 6 months in a year of average precipitation as such averages are
17 determined by the United States geological survey, not used exclusively for agricultural purposes, and
18 navigable by canoes and small boats.
19 (2) "Lakeshore" is the perimeter of a lake when the lake is at mean annual high-water elevation,
20 including the land within 20 horizontal feet from that high-water elevation.
21 (3) "Local governing body" or "governing body" is:
22 (a) that unit of local government authorized to administer the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act
23 on the land adjoining a lake or part of a lake subject to this part; or
24 (b) a city or town with a lake of no more than 5,000 surface acres in or proximate to the city or
25 town and that is the source of drinking water for that city or town.
26 (4) "Mean annual high-water elevation" is the mean average of the highest elevation of a lake in
27 each of at least 5 consecutive years, excluding any high levels caused by erratic or unusual weather or
28 hydrological conditions. A highest elevation caused by operation of a dam or other impoundment counts toward

7 (2) A governing body may issue a stop-work order for construction activities above the lakeshore
