10 WHEREAS, ADVANCED TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGY OFFERS MULTIPLE ADVANTAGES, INCLUDING INCREASED
11 CAPACITY ON EXISTING TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WILDFIRE RISK, especially when an
12 installed powerline conductor has a thermal expansion coefficient no greater than that of an advanced
13 composite conductor, AND IMPROVED GRID RELIABILITY, AND IS A COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO MONTANA'S CURRENT
14 CONGESTION AND CURTAILMENTS OF TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS; AND
15 WHEREAS, THE INTENTION OF THIS LEGISLATION IS TO EXPEDITE THE NECESSARY AND OVERDUE
16 TRANSMISSION UPGRADES NEEDED TO SERVE THE EVER-INCREASING DEMAND OF POWER; AND
17 WHEREAS, THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION HAS THE DECISIONMAKING AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE
18 BALANCE BETWEEN MODERNIZING THE GRID TO INCREASE RELIABILITY AND IDENTIFYING WHAT COSTS ARE REASONABLE
19 OR UNREASONABLE TO ENSURE RATEPAYER AFFORDABILITY.

1 include the following elements:
2 (a) The revenues and costs associated with providing electric transmission service must be
3 unbundled from the revenues and costs associated with providing all other services. Cost recovery and savings
4 from advanced transmission technology compared to legacy transmission technology must be considered over
5 the expected life of the transmission line.
6 (b) The rates associated with the provisions of electric transmission service must be set annually
7 using forecasted revenues and costs expected over a 12-month period, including forecasted revenues the
8 public utility anticipates it will collect from the provisions of the federal energy regulatory commission
9 jurisdictional transmission services during that same period.
10 (c) (i) At the conclusion of each forecasted 12-month period, a public utility shall make a filing to
11 adjust for a recovery that is above or below the actual, prudently incurred costs and for any revenues the public
12 utility receives from providing federal energy regulatory commission jurisdictional services.
13 (ii) If the federal energy regulatory commission grants the recovery of costs in the rate base during
14 construction, the public utility may seek similar treatment of these costs through the optional ratemaking
15 procedures described in this section.
16 (3) Following the initial implementation of unbundled electric transmission rates and optional
17 ratemaking procedures, the commission shall:
18 (a) authorize the public utility to change the rates it charges that are associated with its provision of
19 electric transmission service on a schedule comparable to the schedule the public utility uses to change its
20 federal energy regulatory commission formula rates; and
21 (b) authorize a change in the rates associated with the provision of electric transmission service
22 that is set to go into effect no later than 30 days from the date of filing on an interim basis.
23 (4) A filing to change rates pursuant to this section must comply with the Montana Administrative
24 Procedure Act, Title 2, chapter 4, part 6.
