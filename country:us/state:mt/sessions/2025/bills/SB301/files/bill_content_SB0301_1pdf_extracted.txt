2 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Electric transmission optional ratemaking procedures -- rulemaking.
3 (1) A public utility operating electric transmission facilities that are part of a bulk electric system subject to
4 regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission and whose rates are set by the federal energy
5 regulatory commission using a formula rate process is eligible for optional ratemaking procedures as described
6 in this section.
7 (2) An eligible public utility may establish the optional ratemaking procedures in a general rate
8 filing pursuant to Title 69, chapter 3, part 3. If the public utility is eligible and the proposed optional ratemaking
9 procedures are consistent with this section, the commission may approve optional ratemaking procedures that
10 include the following elements:
11 (a) The revenues and costs associated with providing electric transmission service must be
12 unbundled from the revenues and costs associated with providing all other services. Cost recovery and savings
13 from advanced transmission technology compared to legacy transmission technology must be considered over
14 the expected life of the transmission line.
15 (b) The rates associated with the provisions of electric transmission service must be set annually
16 using forecasted revenues and costs expected over a 12-month period, including forecasted revenues the
17 public utility anticipates it will collect from the provisions of the federal energy regulatory commission
18 jurisdictional transmission services during that same period.
19 (c) (i) At the conclusion of each forecasted 12-month period, a public utility shall make a filing to
20 adjust for a recovery that is above or below the actual, prudently incurred costs and for any revenues the public
21 utility receives from providing federal energy regulatory commission jurisdictional services.
22 (ii) If the federal energy regulatory commission grants the recovery of costs in the rate base during
23 construction, the public utility may seek similar treatment of these costs through the optional ratemaking
24 procedures described in this section.
25 (3) Following the initial implementation of unbundled electric transmission rates and optional
26 ratemaking procedures, the commission shall:
27 (a) authorize the public utility to change the rates it charges that are associated with its provision of
28 electric transmission service on a schedule comparable to the schedule the public utility uses to change its
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 301

1 federal energy regulatory commission formula rates; and
2 (b) authorize a change in the rates associated with the provision of electric transmission service
3 that is set to go into effect no later than 30 days from the date of filing on an interim basis.
4 (4) A filing to change rates pursuant to this section must comply with the Montana Administrative
5 Procedure Act, Title 2, chapter 4, part 6.
