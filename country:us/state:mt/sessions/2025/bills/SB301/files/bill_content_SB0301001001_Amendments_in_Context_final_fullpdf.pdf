1 (b) In making a determination, the commission may consider:
2 (i) the need for the proposed transmission facility to ensure reliable service for customers;
3 (ii) the ability of the proposed transmission facility to improve customer access to reliable and cost-
4 effective electric generation or storage facilities;
5 (iii) the anticipated costs and benefits of the proposed facility;
6 (iv) the use of advanced transmission technology; and
7 (v) any other factors deemed appropriate by the commission.
8 (3) A commission-approved certificate of public convenience and necessity may satisfy the
9 requirements set forth in 75-20-301(1)(a), (1)(d), and (1)(f), and (2) when the department considers siting
10 applications for proposed transmission facilities.
11 (4) The commission shall adopt rules for the implementation of this section.
12
13 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Electric transmission optional ratemaking procedures -- rulemaking.
14 (1) A public utility operating electric transmission facilities that are part of a bulk electric system subject to
15 regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission and whose rates are set by the federal energy
16 regulatory commission using a formula rate process is eligible for optional ratemaking procedures as described
17 in this section.
18 (2) An eligible public utility may establish the optional ratemaking procedures in a general rate
19 filing pursuant to Title 69, chapter 3, part 3. If the public utility is eligible and the proposed optional ratemaking
20 procedures are consistent with this section, the commission may approve optional ratemaking procedures that
21 include the following elements:
22 (a) The revenues and costs associated with providing electric transmission service must be
23 unbundled separate from the revenues and costs associated with providing all other services. Cost recovery
24 and savings from advanced transmission technology compared to legacy transmission technology must be
25 considered over the expected life of the transmission line.
26 (b) The rates associated with the provisions provision of electric transmission service must be set
27 annually using forecasted revenues and costs expected over a 12-month period, including forecasted revenues

1 the public utility anticipates it will collect from the provisions provision of the federal energy regulatory
2 commission jurisdictional transmission services during that same period.
3 (c) (i) At the conclusion of each forecasted 12-month period, a public utility shall make a filing to
4 adjust for a recovery that is above or below the actual, prudently incurred costs and for any revenues the public
5 utility receives from providing federal energy regulatory commission jurisdictional transmission services.
6 (ii) If the federal energy regulatory commission grants the recovery of costs in the rate base during
7 construction, the public utility may seek similar treatment of these costs through the optional ratemaking
8 procedures described in this section.
9 (3) Following the initial implementation of unbundled separate electric transmission rates and
10 optional ratemaking procedures, the commission shall:
11 (a) authorize the public utility to change the rates it charges that are associated with its provision of
12 electric transmission service on a schedule comparable to the schedule the public utility uses to change its
13 federal energy regulatory commission formula rates; and
14 (b) authorize a change in the rates associated with the provision of electric transmission service
15 that is set to go into effect no later than 30 days from the date of filing on an interim basis.
