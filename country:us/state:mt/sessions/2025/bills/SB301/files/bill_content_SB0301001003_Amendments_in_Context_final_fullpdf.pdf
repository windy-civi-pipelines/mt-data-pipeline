8 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Electric transmission optional ratemaking procedures -- rulemaking.
9 (1) A public utility operating electric transmission facilities that are part of a bulk electric system subject to

11 regulatory commission using a formula rate process is eligible for optional ratemaking procedures as described
12 in this section.
13 (2) An eligible public utility may establish the optional ratemaking procedures in a general rate
14 filing pursuant to Title 69, chapter 3, part 3. If the public utility is eligible and the proposed optional ratemaking

3 procedures described in this section.
4 (3) Following the initial implementation of unbundled separate electric transmission rates and
5 optional ratemaking procedures, the commission shall:
