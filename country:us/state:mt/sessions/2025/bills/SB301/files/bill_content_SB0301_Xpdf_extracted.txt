69th Legislature 2025 SB 301
TO GRANT A PUBLIC UTILITY A CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY FOR
ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION FACILITY CONSTRUCTION; ESTABLISHING OPTIONAL RATEMAKING
PROCEDURES AND TIMELINES; PROVIDING RULEMAKING AUTHORITY; PROVIDING DEFINITIONS;
AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE.”
WHEREAS, advanced transmission technology offers multiple advantages, including increased
capacity on existing transmission infrastructure, significantly reduced wildfire risk, especially when an installed
powerline conductor has a thermal expansion coefficient no greater than that of an advanced composite
conductor, and improved grid reliability, and is a cost-effective solution to Montana's current congestion and
curtailments of transmission pathways; and
WHEREAS, the intention of this legislation is to expedite the necessary and overdue transmission
upgrades needed to serve the ever-increasing demand of power; and
WHEREAS, the Public Service Commission has the decisionmaking authority to determine the balance
between modernizing the grid to increase reliability and identifying what costs are reasonable or unreasonable
to ensure ratepayer affordability.

determine if the application is adequate and in compliance with the commission's minimum filing requirements.
If the commission determines the application is inadequate, it shall explain the deficiencies.
(3) The commission shall issue an order within 90 days after receiving an application for
transmission lines and related facilities, unless the commission determines that extraordinary circumstances
warrant additional time.
(4) Subject to [section 2(2)] and after the department issues the certificate of compliance pursuant
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 301
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025

to Title 75, chapter 20, as applicable, the commission may:
(a) (i) approve or deny, in whole or in partan application for advanced cost approval of a
transmission line and facility to give the public utility a presumption in any future rate proceeding that the actual
construction costs for that line are prudent if the actual construction costs are less than or equal to the
approved costs; or
(ii) to the extent actual costs are greater than approved costs, there is no presumption the actual
construction costs for that line are prudent, and the commission shall determine if the costs are prudent and
recoverable; and
(b) consider all relevant information until the administrative record in the proceeding is closed for
