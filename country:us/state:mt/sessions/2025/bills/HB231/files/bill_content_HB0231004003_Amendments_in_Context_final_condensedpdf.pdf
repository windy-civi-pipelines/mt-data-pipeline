1 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
2 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
3 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
4 (2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review
5 provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board
6 and then to the Montana tax appeal board, whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts.
7 An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
8 the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
9 determines that the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate should apply, the
10 department shall adjust the taxable value of the property in accordance with the board's order.
11
12 NEW SECTION. Section 6. Rulemaking authority. The department shall adopt rules that are
13 necessary to implement and administer [sections 1 through 7 6].
14
15 NEW SECTION. SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS AND FIXED MILL
16 LEVY LIMITS SUPERSEDED. (1) (A) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SET MILL LEVIES THAT
17 ADJUST DOWNWARD WHEN TAXABLE VALUE INCREASES UNDER 15-10-420. THIS FLOATING MILL LEVY CONCEPT
18 AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE,
19 WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE OCCURS
20 WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR TAXPAYERS THAT
21 ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
22 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
23 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO
24 RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THE POWER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 5, OF THE MONTANA
25 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.
26 (2) AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO SUPERSEDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS
27 THAT FIX MILL LEVY LIMITS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF EXERCISING THE POWER TO TAX WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, HB0231.004.003
1 LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCES WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS. HAVING CONSIDERED
2 ALL OPTIONS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THE STATUTORY STRUCTURE OF THE PROPERTY TAX HAS
3 EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF INITIATIVE MEASURE NO. 105 ON NOVEMBER 4, 1986, AND THE
4 ENACTMENT OF 15-10-420 BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 1999. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
5 PROPERTY TAX AND THE RISING COST OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, THERE IS A COMPELLING
6 INTEREST TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE TO LOWER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAX RATES FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCES,
7 WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS SECTION AND 15-10-420.
8 (3) AFTER [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION], A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A
9 SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED, EITHER BY CHARTER OR BY VOTER APPROVAL MAY shall:
10 (A) ELECT TO TRANSITION A VOTED MILL LEVY TO A DOLLAR-BASED MILL LEVY EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF
11 PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025 AND THEREAFTER SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF 15-10-420(1)(A);
12 OR
13 (B) LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2026 THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
14 TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL LEVY THE
15 NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.
16
17 NEW SECTION. SECTION 8. REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOSS OF REVENUE FROM CERTAIN FIXED MILL LEVIES.
18 (1) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL REIMBURSE EACH TAXING ENTITY AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION FOR THE REVENUE LOSS
19 RESULTING FROM THE TAX RATE REDUCTIONS IN 15-6-134 AS AMENDED BY [THIS ACT] FOR THE FOLLOWING LEVIES:
20 (A) LEVIES OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A CHARTER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT INCLUDES A MILL
21 LEVY LIMIT OF A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE CHARTER; AND
22 (B) LEVIES STATED AS A SPECIFIC MILL LEVY AUTHORIZED BY VOTERS BEFORE [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
23 THIS SECTION].
24 (2) FOR FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
25 PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1) AND THE PROPERTY TAX
26 REVENUE COLLECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. AFTER FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE
27 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1)
