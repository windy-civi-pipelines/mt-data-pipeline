Section 8:
Section 4. Homestead and rental property reduced tax rates -- improper approval -- penalty for
false or fraudulent application. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), if the department determines that an
application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax rate was improperly approved or
that the property no longer qualifies for the reduced rate, the department shall revise the assessment for each
year the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate was improperly granted subject to
the assessment revision procedure established in 15-8-601.
(2) (a) A person who files a false or fraudulent application for a homestead reduced tax rate
provided for in [section 2 or 3] or for a rental property reduced tax rate provided for in [section 4 3] is subject to
criminal prosecution under the provisions of 45-7-202.
(3) (a) If a person is determined to have filed a false or fraudulent application, the department shall
revise the assessment of the property subject to the assessment revision procedure established in this section
and 15-8-601 and assess a penalty as provided in this subsection (3). The penalty is equal to three times the
base penalty amount calculated under subsection (3)(b) plus interest at the rate provided in 15-16-102
calculated from the original due date of the taxes, until paid.
(b) The base penalty amount is equal to the property tax due for each year the homestead
reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate was improperly received, determined using the tax rate
provided for in 15-6-134(3)(a), the appraised value, and the mill levies in effect for the year, less the actual
property taxes paid in the year.

fraudulent application even if the person no longer owns the property.
(4) If the person who filed a false or fraudulent application no longer owns the property associated
with the false or fraudulent application, the penalty plus interest provided for in subsection (3) may be recovered
as any other tax owed the state. If the penalty plus interest becomes due and owing, the department may issue
a warrant for distraint as provided in Title 15, chapter 1, part 7.
(5) Except as provided in subsection (4), if the department determines that a false or fraudulent
application was made, the department shall send the revised assessment with the additional penalty amount as
determined under subsection (3) to the county treasurer in the county where the property is located.

Section 9:
section proportionally to the affected taxing jurisdictions.
(7) A revised assessment made under this section must be made within 10 years after the end of
the calendar year in which the original application was made.

Section 10:
Section 5. Appeal of denial of reduced tax rate. (1) (a) If the department denies an application for a
homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax rate, the owner may request an informal review of
the denial by submitting an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the department for that purpose
in a manner prescribed by the department. The objection must be made no later than 30 days after the date of
the denial notification sent pursuant to [section 2 (4) or 3(6)].
(b) The property owner may request that the department consider extenuating circumstances to
grant an application for the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate. Extenuating
circumstances include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are material in
nature and of a character different from the typical or customary, and that are not expected to recur.
(c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
(2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review
provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board
and then to the Montana tax appeal board, whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts.
An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
determines that the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate should apply, the
department shall adjust the taxable value of the property in accordance with the board's order.

Section 11:
Section 6. Rulemaking authority. The department shall adopt rules that are necessary to implement
and administer [sections 1 through 6].

Section 12:
Section 7. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy limits
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
superseded -- definition. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
(b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
(2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
(3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
levied in fiscal year 2026.
(4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed for
public safety that was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section] may:
(a) elect to transition a voted mill public safety levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount
of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
(b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
levied in fiscal year 2026.
(5) As used in this section, "public safety" means police, fire, and emergency medical services.

Section 13:
Section 8. Reimbursement for loss of revenue from certain fixed mill levies -- definition. (1) The
department shall reimburse each taxing entity as provided in this section for the revenue loss resulting from the
tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] for the following levies:
(a) levies of a local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a
specific number of mills that may be imposed in the charter; and
(b) levies stated as a specific mill levy authorized by voters for public safety before [the effective
date of this act].
(2) (a) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue
collected in fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between
the property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue
that would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax
revenue using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
(b) A reimbursement pursuant to this section must include any fines, penalties, or damages
resulting from a judgment levy against the taxing entity in levying property taxes in accordance with [section 7].
(3) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in
revenue from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] and any amount reimbursable under
subsection (2)(b) to the department of revenue.
(4) A reimbursement provided for in this section may only be made for 4 years after [the effective
date of this section].
(5) The department shall distribute the reimbursements with the entitlement share payments under
15-1-121(7).
(6) As used in this section, "public safety" means police, fire, and emergency medical services.

Section 14:

1 acre, as is reasonably necessary for its use as a dwelling and that were assessed and paid by the taxpayer
for tax year 2024. The amount of Montana property taxes assessed and paid is equal to the total amount billed

(4) "Tax year 2024" means the period January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.

- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
who does not receive a notice may still be eligible to claim a rebate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of
notice, shall claim a rebate as provided in subsection (5).
(4) Except as provided in subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a
multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home, or mobile home and as much of the surrounding land, not

(5) (a) (i) All claims for this property tax rebate must be submitted to the department electronically
or by mail.
(ii) Electronic claims must be submitted between August 15, 2025, and October 1, 2025, through

(iv) The department may grant an extension of time if the claimant establishes good cause for
missing the October 1 deadline. The department's authority to consider an application terminates on December
1, 2025, and any applications or requests for extension received after that date may not be processed.
(b) Subject to subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a claim for rebate must be submitted, under penalty of
false swearing and the penalties provided in [section 11], on a form prescribed by the department and must
contain:
(i) an affirmation that the claimant owns and maintains the land and improvements as the principal
residence as defined in [section 9];
(ii) the geocode or other property identifier for the principal residence that the claimant is

subsection (2), if the department discovers that a rebate paid to a taxpayer exceeded the amount allowed by

taxpayer, assess the taxpayer for the difference. The assessment is subject to the uniform dispute review
procedure established in 15-1-211.
(2) A person who files a false or fraudulent claim for a property tax rebate under [sections 9
through 11] is subject to criminal prosecution under the provisions of 45-7-202. If a false or fraudulent claim has
been paid by the department, the amount paid may be recovered as any other tax owed the state, together with
a penalty of 300% of the rebate claimed and interest on the amount of the rebate claimed plus penalty at the

warrant for distraint as provided in Title 15, chapter 1, part 7.

Section 18:

"15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this

Section 19:
section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain

state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,

sending a portion to other local governments.

7;
(g) all beer, liquor, and wine taxes pursuant to:
(i) 16-1-404;
(ii) 16-1-406; and
(iii) 16-1-411;
(h) late filing fees pursuant to 61-3-220;

(n) state aeronautics fees pursuant to 67-3-101; and
(o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
(3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
(4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
year.
(b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
(i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
multiplied by 0.25.
(ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
the lesser of:
(A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
(B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
(iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
(iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
(A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
(B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
(C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
(5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in

Section 20:
2002.
(6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
(b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
be calculated separately for:
(A) counties;
(B) consolidated local governments; and
(C) incorporated cities and towns.
(ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
(A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
(B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
United States bureau of the census.
(iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
follows:
(A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
and
(B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
(iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
follows:
(A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
(B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
(v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
(7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this

Section 21:
section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
(b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
(c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
(d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 8].
(8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
(b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
financing districts is as follows:
Flathead Kalispell - District 2 $4,638
Flathead Kalispell - District 3 37,231
Flathead Whitefish District 148,194
Gallatin Bozeman - downtown 31,158
Missoula Missoula - 1-1C 225,251
Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
(9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
(10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
(11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
(12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
(b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
(i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and
(ii) fails to remit any amounts collected on behalf of the state as required by 15-1-504 or as
otherwise required by law within 45 days of the end of a month.

- 24 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
2-year valuation cycle. An objection made more than 30 days from the date of the classification and appraisal
notice will be applicable only for the second year of the 2-year valuation cycle. For an objection to apply to the
second year of the valuation cycle, the taxpayer shall make the objection in writing or by checking a box on the
notice no later than June 1 of the second year of the valuation cycle or, if a classification and appraisal notice is
received in the second year of the valuation cycle, within 30 days from the date on the notice.
(iii) For centrally assessed property described in 15-23-101(2)(a), the objection must be submitted
within 20 days from the date on the notice. A taxpayer may submit an objection up to 10 days after this deadline
on request to the department.
(iv) (A) For centrally assessed property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) and (2)(c), an objection to the
valuation or classification may be made only once each valuation cycle. An objection must be made in writing
within the time period specified in subsection (3)(a)(iii) for a reduction in the appraised value to be considered
for both years of the 2-year valuation cycle. An objection made after the deadline specified in subsection
(3)(a)(iii) will be applicable only for the second year of the 2-year valuation cycle. For an objection to apply to
the second year of the valuation cycle, the taxpayer shall make the objection in writing no later than June 1 of

subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a
business, including bankruptcies, acquisitions, sales of assets, or mergers.
(b) If the objection relates to residential or commercial property and the objector agrees to the
confidentiality requirements, the department shall provide to the objector, by posted mail or electronically, within
8 weeks of submission of the objection, the following information:
(i) the methodology and sources of data used by the department in the valuation of the property;
and

69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
(ii) if the department uses a blend of evaluations developed from various sources, the reasons that
the methodology was used.
(c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
electronic form:
(i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
(ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
market model area; and
(iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the
documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.
(d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
(e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
(f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the

- 26 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL

classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
(4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
(a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
department or by checking a box on the notice; and
(b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
for making the adjustment.
(5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
office hours.
(6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the

whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board

additional tax is not owed and a new tax bill does not need to be prepared."

Section 40:
Section 28. Coordination instruction. If Senate Bill No. 542, House Bill No. 863, and [this act] are
passed and approved, then the section in House Bill No. 863 that coordinates with [this act] is void.

Section 41:
Section 29. Coordination instruction. If both Senate Bill No. 542 and [this act] are passed and
approved, then [sections 1 through 23 and 25 of this act] are void and [section 4 of Senate Bill No. 542] must be
amended as follows:

Section 42:
Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy limits
superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust downward
when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers the number
of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in property values.
However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and property taxes are
not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
(b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
- 42 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
(2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
(3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall may levy an amount not
to exceed the number of mills levied in fiscal year 2026.
(4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:
(a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
(b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall may levy an amount not to
exceed the number of mills levied in fiscal year 2026."

Section 43:
Section 30. Appropriation. (1) There is appropriated $500,000 from the general fund to the
department of revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, to implement [this act]. The legislature intends
this to be an addition to the “Property Tax Revision Implementation" appropriation in House Bill No. 2.
(2) There is appropriated $3.5 million from the general fund to the department of revenue for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, to implement [this act]. The legislature intends this to be an addition to the

“Property Tax Revision Implementation" appropriation in House Bill No. 2.

Section 44:
Section 31. Coordination instruction. If Senate Bill No. 542 and [this act] are both passed and
approved, then [sections 1 through 23, 25, and 30 of this act] are void and Senate Bill No. 542 must be
amended to include a new section that reads:

Section 45:
Section 32. Appropriation. (1) There is appropriated $500,000 from the general fund to the
department of revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, to implement [this act]. The legislature intends
this to be an addition to the “Property Tax Revision Implementation" appropriation in House Bill No. 2.
(2) There is appropriated $3.5 million from the general fund to the department of revenue for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, to implement [this act]. The legislature intends this to be an addition to the
“Property Tax Revision Implementation" appropriation in House Bill No. 2."

Section 46:
Section 32. Applicability -- retroactive applicability. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), [this
act] applies retroactively to property tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.
(2) [Sections 1 through 6, 13, and 15 through 20] apply to property tax years beginning after
December 31, 2025.

Section 47:
Section 33. Termination. (1) [Section 14] terminates December 31, 2025.
(2) [Sections 9 through 11 and 21] terminate June 30, 2026.

Section 48:
Section 34. Contingent termination. [Sections 8 and 12] terminate on the date that the department
of revenue certifies to the code commissioner that reimbursements authorized pursuant to [section 8] have
been completed. The department of revenue shall submit certification within 30 days of the occurrence of the

property reduced tax rate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of notice, shall apply for a reduced rate as
provided in this subsection (2).

(3) An application for a rental property reduced tax rate must be submitted on a form prescribed by
the department and must contain:
(a) a written declaration made under penalty of perjury that the applicant owns and maintains the
land and improvements as a long-term rental as defined in [section 1]. The application must state the penalty

(4) To continue receiving the rental property reduced tax rate, the owner of a qualifying long-term
rental shall reapply as required by the department. Beginning in 2028, the department shall require
reapplication of 20% of long-term rentals each year.
(5) Periods of short-term vacancy not exceeding 3 5 months in a 12-month period do not disqualify
a long-term rental from receiving the rental property reduced tax rate.
(6) The department shall notify the owner if the rental property reduced tax rate is applied to the
property or if the application was denied.

Section 4. Homestead and rental property reduced tax rates -- improper approval -- penalty for
false or fraudulent application. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), if the department determines that an
application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax rate was improperly approved or
that the property no longer qualifies for the reduced rate, the department shall revise the assessment for each
year the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate was improperly granted subject to
the assessment revision procedure established in 15-8-601.
(2) (a) A person who files a false or fraudulent application for a homestead reduced tax rate
provided for in [section 2 or 3] or for a rental property reduced tax rate provided for in [section 4 3] is subject to
criminal prosecution under the provisions of 45-7-202.
(3) (a) If a person is determined to have filed a false or fraudulent application, the department shall
revise the assessment of the property subject to the assessment revision procedure established in this section
and 15-8-601 and assess a penalty as provided in this subsection (3). The penalty is equal to three times the
base penalty amount calculated under subsection (3)(b) plus interest at the rate provided in 15-16-102
calculated from the original due date of the taxes, until paid.
(b) The base penalty amount is equal to the property tax due for each year the homestead
reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate was improperly received, determined using the tax rate
provided for in 15-6-134(3)(a), the appraised value, and the mill levies in effect for the year, less the actual
property taxes paid in the year.
(c) The revised assessment and penalty must be assessed against a person who filed a false or
fraudulent application even if the person no longer owns the property.
(4) If the person who filed a false or fraudulent application no longer owns the property associated
with the false or fraudulent application, the penalty plus interest provided for in subsection (3) may be recovered
as any other tax owed the state. If the penalty plus interest becomes due and owing, the department may issue
a warrant for distraint as provided in Title 15, chapter 1, part 7.
(5) Except as provided in subsection (4), if the department determines that a false or fraudulent
application was made, the department shall send the revised assessment with the additional penalty amount as
determined under subsection (3) to the county treasurer in the county where the property is located.
(6) The county treasurer shall distribute property taxes, penalty, and interest collected under this
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL

69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
section proportionally to the affected taxing jurisdictions.
(7) A revised assessment made under this section must be made within 10 years after the end of
the calendar year in which the original application was made.
Section 5. Appeal of denial of reduced tax rate. (1) (a) If the department denies an application for a
homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax rate, the owner may request an informal review of
the denial by submitting an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the department for that purpose
in a manner prescribed by the department. The objection must be made no later than 30 days after the date of
the denial notification sent pursuant to [section 2 (4) or 3(6)].
(b) The property owner may request that the department consider extenuating circumstances to
grant an application for the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate. Extenuating
circumstances include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are material in
nature and of a character different from the typical or customary, and that are not expected to recur.
(c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
(2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review
provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board
and then to the Montana tax appeal board, whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts.
An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
determines that the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate should apply, the
department shall adjust the taxable value of the property in accordance with the board's order.
Section 6. Rulemaking authority. The department shall adopt rules that are necessary to implement
and administer [sections 1 through 6].
Section 7. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy limits
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
superseded -- definition. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
(b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
(2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
(3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
levied in fiscal year 2026.
(4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed for
public safety that was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section] may:
(a) elect to transition a voted mill public safety levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount
of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
(b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
levied in fiscal year 2026.
(5) As used in this section, "public safety" means police, fire, and emergency medical services.
Section 8. Reimbursement for loss of revenue from certain fixed mill levies -- definition. (1) The
department shall reimburse each taxing entity as provided in this section for the revenue loss resulting from the
tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] for the following levies:
(a) levies of a local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a
specific number of mills that may be imposed in the charter; and
(b) levies stated as a specific mill levy authorized by voters for public safety before [the effective
date of this act].
(2) (a) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue
collected in fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between
the property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue
that would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax
revenue using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
(b) A reimbursement pursuant to this section must include any fines, penalties, or damages
resulting from a judgment levy against the taxing entity in levying property taxes in accordance with [section 7].
(3) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in
revenue from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] and any amount reimbursable under
subsection (2)(b) to the department of revenue.
(4) A reimbursement provided for in this section may only be made for 4 years after [the effective
date of this section].
(5) The department shall distribute the reimbursements with the entitlement share payments under
15-1-121(7).
(6) As used in this section, "public safety" means police, fire, and emergency medical services.
Section 9. Definitions. As used in [sections 9 through 11], the following definitions apply:

rebate if the taxpayer paid the Montana property taxes while residing in each principal residence for a total of at
least 7 consecutive months for the 2024 tax year.
(4) "Tax year 2024" means the period January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.
Section 10. Property tax rebate -- manner of claiming -- limitations -- appeals. (1) Subject to the

by a taxpayer or taxpayers on property they owned and occupied as a principal residence during tax year 2024.
(3) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by June 30, 2025, for tax year 2024.
Receipt of a notice does not establish that a taxpayer or property owner is eligible for a rebate, and a taxpayer
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
who does not receive a notice may still be eligible to claim a rebate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of
notice, shall claim a rebate as provided in subsection (5).
(4) Except as provided in subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a
multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home, or mobile home and as much of the surrounding land, not
exceeding 1 acre that is owned by an entity is not eligible to claim the rebate.
(5) (a) (i) All claims for this property tax rebate must be submitted to the department electronically
or by mail.
(ii) Electronic claims must be submitted between August 15, 2025, and October 1, 2025, through
the department's website.

missing the October 1 deadline. The department's authority to consider an application terminates on December
1, 2025, and any applications or requests for extension received after that date may not be processed.
(b) Subject to subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a claim for rebate must be submitted, under penalty of
false swearing and the penalties provided in [section 11], on a form prescribed by the department and must
contain:
(i) an affirmation that the claimant owns and maintains the land and improvements as the principal
residence as defined in [section 9];
(ii) the geocode or other property identifier for the principal residence that the claimant is

Section 11. Property tax rebate -- penalty for false or fraudulent claim. (1) Except as provided in
subsection (2), if the department discovers that a rebate paid to a taxpayer exceeded the amount allowed by
[sections 9 through 11], the department may, within 1 year from the date the rebate was transmitted to the
taxpayer, assess the taxpayer for the difference. The assessment is subject to the uniform dispute review
procedure established in 15-1-211.
(2) A person who files a false or fraudulent claim for a property tax rebate under [sections 9
through 11] is subject to criminal prosecution under the provisions of 45-7-202. If a false or fraudulent claim has
been paid by the department, the amount paid may be recovered as any other tax owed the state, together with
a penalty of 300% of the rebate claimed and interest on the amount of the rebate claimed plus penalty at the
rate of 12% a year, until paid. If this rebate plus penalty becomes due and owing, the department may issue a
warrant for distraint as provided in Title 15, chapter 1, part 7.
Section 12. Section 15-1-121, MCA, is amended to read:
"15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
sending a portion to other local governments.
(2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
(a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),
Chapter 584, Laws of 1999;

(vii) Title 61, chapter 3, part 7;
(viii) 5% of the fees collected under 61-10-122;

(n) state aeronautics fees pursuant to 67-3-101; and
(o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
(3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
(4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
year.
(b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
(i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
multiplied by 0.25.
(ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
the lesser of:
(A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
(B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
(iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
(iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
(A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
(B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
(C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
(5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
2002.
(6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
(b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
be calculated separately for:
(A) counties;
(B) consolidated local governments; and
(C) incorporated cities and towns.
(ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
(A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
(B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
United States bureau of the census.
(iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
follows:
(A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
and
(B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
(iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
follows:
(A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
(B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
(v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
(7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
(b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
(c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
(d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 8].
(8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),

if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
(b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment

notice and returning it to the department in a manner prescribed by the department.

received in the second year of the valuation cycle, within 30 days from the date on the notice.
(iii) For centrally assessed property described in 15-23-101(2)(a), the objection must be submitted

valuation or classification may be made only once each valuation cycle. An objection must be made in writing
within the time period specified in subsection (3)(a)(iii) for a reduction in the appraised value to be considered
for both years of the 2-year valuation cycle. An objection made after the deadline specified in subsection
(3)(a)(iii) will be applicable only for the second year of the 2-year valuation cycle. For an objection to apply to

subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a
business, including bankruptcies, acquisitions, sales of assets, or mergers.
(b) If the objection relates to residential or commercial property and the objector agrees to the
confidentiality requirements, the department shall provide to the objector, by posted mail or electronically, within
8 weeks of submission of the objection, the following information:
(i) the methodology and sources of data used by the department in the valuation of the property;
and

(ii) if the department uses a blend of evaluations developed from various sources, the reasons that
the methodology was used.

representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
electronic form:
(i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
(ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
market model area; and
(iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the
documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.
(d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
(e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
(f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
- 26 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL

classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
(4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
(a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
department or by checking a box on the notice; and
(b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
for making the adjustment.
(5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
office hours.
(6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
accordance with the board's order."

amended as follows:
Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy limits
superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust downward
when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers the number
of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in property values.
However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and property taxes are
not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
(b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
- 42 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 231
respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
(2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
(3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
