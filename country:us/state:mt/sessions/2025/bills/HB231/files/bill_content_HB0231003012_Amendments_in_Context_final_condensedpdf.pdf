2 Section 11. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
3 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
4 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
5 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
6 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
7 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
8 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
9 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
10 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
11 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
12 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
13 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
14 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
15 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
16 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
17 labor.
18 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
19 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
20 including newly taxable property.
21 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
22 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
23 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
24 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
25 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
26 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
27 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
28 increase in the incremental taxable value within a district that uses tax increment financing district.or

1 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
2 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a district that uses tax increment financing district
3 because of:
4 (i) a change in the district boundary of a tax increment financing district;
5 (ii) an increase in the base taxable value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-
6 4287; or
7 (iii) the termination of a district that uses tax increment financing district.
8 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
9 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
10 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
11 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
12 following tax year.
13 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
14 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
15 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
16 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
17 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
18 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
19 (5)(4) Subject to subsection (8)(7), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:
20 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or
21 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
22 (6)(5) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
23 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
24 (7)(6) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
25 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
26 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
27 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).

1 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
2 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
3 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
4 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
5 (9)(8) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
6 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
7 (ii) a levy to repay taxes paid under protest as provided in 15-1-402;
8 (iii) an emergency levy authorized under 10-3-405, 20-9-168, or 20-15-326;
9 (iv) a levy for the support of a study commission under 7-3-184;
10 (v) a levy for the support of a newly established regional resource authority;
11 (vi) the portion that is the amount in excess of the base contribution of a governmental entity's
12 property tax levy for contributions for group benefits excluded under 2-9-212 or 2-18-703;
13 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
14 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
15 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
16 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
17 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
18 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix)(8)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
19 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) (8)(a) may not be included in the amount of property
20 taxes actually assessed in a subsequent year.
21 (10)(9) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
22 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
23 authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated
24 operating funds by a county or municipality during that time.
25 (11)(10) The department may adopt rules to implement this section. The rules may include a method for
26 calculating the percentage of change in valuation for purposes of determining the elimination of property, new
27 improvements, or newly taxable value in a governmental unit."

15 Section 19. Section 20-9-502, MCA, is amended to read:
16 "20-9-502. Purpose and authorization of building reserve fund -- subfund structure. (1) The
17 trustees of any district may establish a building reserve fund to budget for and expend funds for any of the
18 purposes set forth in this section. Appropriate subfunds must be created to ensure separate tracking of the
19 expenditure of funds from voted and nonvoted levies and transfers for school safety pursuant to 20-9-236.
20 (2) (a) A voted levy may be imposed and a subfund must be created with the approval of the
21 qualified electors of the district for the purpose of raising money for the future construction, equipping, or
22 enlarging of school buildings or for the purpose of purchasing land needed for school purposes in the district. In
23 order to submit to the qualified electors of the district a building reserve proposition for the establishment of or
24 addition to a building reserve, the trustees shall pass a resolution that specifies:
25 (i) the purpose or purposes for which the new or addition to the building reserve will be used;
26 (ii) the duration of time over which the new or addition to the building reserve will be raised in
27 annual, equal installments;
28 (iii) the total amount of money that will be raised during the duration of time specified for the levy;

1 and
2 (iv) any other requirements under 15-10-425 and 20-20-201 for the calling of an election.
3 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b), a building reserve tax authorization may not be for
4 more than 20 10 years.
5 (c) The election must be conducted in accordance with the school election laws of this title, and
6 the electors qualified to vote in the election must be qualified under the provisions of 20-20-301. The ballot for a
7 building reserve proposition must be substantially in compliance with 15-10-425.
8 (d) The building reserve proposition is approved if a majority of those electors voting at the election
9 approve the establishment of or addition to the building reserve. The annual budgeting and taxation authority of
10 the trustees for a building reserve is computed by dividing the total authorized amount by the specified number
11 of years. The authority of the trustees to budget and impose the taxation for the annual amount to be raised for
12 the building reserve lapses when, at a later time, a bond issue is approved by the qualified electors of the
13 district for the same purpose or purposes for which the building reserve fund of the district was established.
14 Whenever a subsequent bond issue is made for the same purpose or purposes of a building reserve, the
15 money in the building reserve must be used for the purpose or purposes before any money realized by the
16 bond issue is used.
17 (3) (a) A subfund must be created to account for revenue and expenditures for school major
18 maintenance and repairs authorized under this subsection (3). The trustees of a district may authorize and
19 impose a levy of no more than 10 mills on the taxable value of all taxable property within the district for that
20 school fiscal year for the purposes of raising revenue for identified improvements or projects meeting the
21 requirements of 20-9-525(2). The 10-mill limit under this subsection (3) must be calculated using the district's
22 total taxable valuation most recently certified by the department of revenue under 15-10-202. The amount of
23 money raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and
24 anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) may not exceed the district's school major maintenance amount.
25 For the purposes of this section, the term "school major maintenance amount" means the sum of $15,000 and
26 the product of $110 multiplied by the district's budgeted ANB for the prior fiscal year. To authorize and impose a
27 levy under this subsection (3), the trustees shall:
28 (i) following public notice requirements pursuant to 20-9-116, adopt no later than March 31 of

1 each fiscal year a resolution:
2 (A) identifying the anticipated improvements or projects for which the proceeds of the levy, the
3 deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to
4 20-9-525(3) will be used; and
5 (B) estimating a total dollar amount of money to be raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers
6 authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3), and the
7 resulting estimated number of mills to be levied using the district's taxable valuation most recently certified by
8 the department of revenue under 15-10-202; and
9 (ii) include the amount of any final levy to be imposed as part of its final budget meeting noticed in
10 compliance with 20-9-131.
11 (b) Proceeds from the levy may be expended only for the purposes under 20-9-525(2), and the
12 expenditure of the money must be reported in the annual trustees' report as required by 20-9-213.
13 (c) Whenever the trustees of a district impose a levy pursuant to this subsection (3) during the
14 current school fiscal year, they shall budget for the proceeds of the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized
15 under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) in the district's building
16 reserve fund budget. Any expenditures of the funds must be made in accordance with the financial
17 administration provisions of this title for a budgeted fund.
18 (d) When a tax levy pursuant to this subsection (3) is included as a revenue item on the final
19 building reserve fund budget, the county superintendent shall report the levy requirement to the county
20 commissioners by the later of the first Tuesday in September or within 30 calendar days after receiving certified
21 taxable values and a levy on the district must be made by the county commissioners in accordance with 20-9-
22 142.
23 (e) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for the deposit of proceeds from the
24 levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid
25 pursuant to 20-9-525(3).
26 (f) If the imposition of 10 mills pursuant to subsection (3)(a) is estimated by the trustees to
27 generate an amount less than the maximum levy revenue specified in subsection (3)(a), the trustees may
28 deposit additional funds from any lawfully available revenue source and may transfer additional funds from any

1 lawfully available fund of the district to the subfund provided for in subsection (3)(a), up to the difference
2 between the revenue estimated to be raised by the imposition of 10 mills and the maximum levy revenue
3 specified in subsection (3)(a). The district's local effort for purposes of calculating its eligibility for state school
4 major maintenance aid pursuant to 20-9-525 consists of the combined total of funds raised from the imposition
5 of 10 mills and additional funds raised from deposits and transfers in compliance with this subsection (3)(f).
6 (4) (a) A voted levy may be imposed and a subfund must be created with the approval of the
7 qualified electors of the district to provide funding for transition costs incurred when the trustees:
8 (i) open a new school under the provisions of Title 20, chapter 6;
9 (ii) close a school;
10 (iii) replace a school building;
11 (iv) consolidate with or annex another district under the provisions of Title 20, chapter 6; or
12 (v) receive approval from voters to expand an elementary district into a K-12 district pursuant to
13 20-6-326.
14 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(c), the total amount the trustees may submit to the
15 electorate for transition costs may not exceed the number of years specified in the proposition times the greater
16 of 5% of the district's maximum general fund budget for the current year or $250 per ANB for the current year.
17 The duration of the levy for transition costs may not exceed 6 years.
18 (c) If the levy for transition costs is for consolidation or annexation:
19 (i) the limitation on the amount levied is calculated using the ANB and the maximum general fund
20 budget for the districts that are being combined; and
21 (ii) the proposition must be submitted to the qualified electors in the combined district.
22 (d) The levy for transition costs may not be considered as outstanding indebtedness for the
23 purpose of calculating the limitation in 20-9-406.
24 (5) (a) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for:
25 (i) the funds transferred to the building reserve fund for school safety and security pursuant to 20-
26 9-236; and
27 (ii) funds generated by a voter-approved levy for school and student safety and security pursuant
28 to subsection (5)(b) of this section.
