9 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
10 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
11 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
12 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
13 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
14 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
15 sending a portion to other local governments.

17 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
