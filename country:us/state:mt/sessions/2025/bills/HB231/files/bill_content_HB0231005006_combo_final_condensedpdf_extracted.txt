1 with [this act] is void.

3
4 COORDINATION SECTION. Section 29. Coordination instruction. If both Senate Bill No. 542 and
5 [this act] are passed and approved, then [sections 1 through 23 and 25 of this act] are void and [section 4 of
6 Senate Bill No. 542] must be amended as follows:
7 "NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill
8 levy limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
9 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
10 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
11 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
12 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
13 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
14 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
15 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
16 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
17 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
18 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
19 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
20 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
21 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
22 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
23 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
24 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
25 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
26 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
27 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
28 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall may levy an amount not

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Conference Committee on HB 231
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, HB0231.005.006
1 to exceed the number of mills levied in fiscal year 2026.
2 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
3 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:
4 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
5 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
6 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
7 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall may levy an amount not to
8 exceed the number of mills levied in fiscal year 2026."

11 NEW SECTION. Section 30. Appropriation. (1) There is appropriated $500,000 from the general
12 fund to the department of revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, to implement [this act]. The
13 legislature intends this to be an addition to the “Property Tax Revision Implementation" appropriation in House
14 Bill No. 2.
15 (2) There is appropriated $3.5 million from the general fund to the department of revenue for the
16 fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, to implement [this act]. The legislature intends this to be an addition to the
17 “Property Tax Revision Implementation" appropriation in House Bill No. 2.
18
19 COORDINATION SECTION. Section 31. Coordination instruction. If Senate Bill No. 542 and [this
20 act] are both passed and approved, then [sections 1 through 23, 25, and 30 of this act] are void and Senate Bill
21 No. 542 must be amended to include a new section that reads:
22 "NEW SECTION. Section 32. Appropriation. (1) There is appropriated $500,000 from the general
23 fund to the department of revenue for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, to implement [this act]. The
24 legislature intends this to be an addition to the “Property Tax Revision Implementation" appropriation in House
25 Bill No. 2.
26 (2) There is appropriated $3.5 million from the general fund to the department of revenue for the
27 fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, to implement [this act]. The legislature intends this to be an addition to the

4 COORDINATION SECTION. Section 29. Coordination instruction. If both Senate Bill No. 542 and
5 [this act] are passed and approved, then [sections 1 through 23 and 25 of this act] are void and [section 4 of
6 Senate Bill No. 542] must be amended as follows:
7 "NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill
8 levy limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
9 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
10 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
11 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
12 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
13 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
14 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
15 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
16 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
17 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
18 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
19 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
20 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
21 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
22 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
23 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
24 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
25 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
26 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
27 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
28 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall may levy an amount not

1 to exceed the number of mills levied in fiscal year 2026.
2 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
3 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:
4 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
5 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
6 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
7 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall may levy an amount not to
8 exceed the number of mills levied in fiscal year 2026."
