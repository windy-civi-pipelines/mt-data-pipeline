- 8 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025

3
4 NEW SECTION. Section 6. Rulemaking authority. The department shall adopt rules that are
5 necessary to implement and administer [sections 1 through 7 6].
6
7 NEW SECTION. SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS AND FIXED MILL
8 LEVY LIMITS SUPERSEDED. (1) (A) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SET MILL LEVIES THAT
9 ADJUST DOWNWARD WHEN TAXABLE VALUE INCREASES UNDER 15-10-420. THIS FLOATING MILL LEVY CONCEPT
10 AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE,
11 WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE OCCURS
12 WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR TAXPAYERS THAT
13 ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
14 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
15 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO
16 RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THE POWER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 5, OF THE MONTANA
17 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.
18 (2) AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO SUPERSEDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS
19 THAT FIX MILL LEVY LIMITS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF EXERCISING THE POWER TO TAX WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING
20 LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCES WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS. HAVING CONSIDERED
21 ALL OPTIONS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THE STATUTORY STRUCTURE OF THE PROPERTY TAX HAS
22 EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF INITIATIVE MEASURE NO. 105 ON NOVEMBER 4, 1986, AND THE
23 ENACTMENT OF 15-10-420 BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 1999. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
24 PROPERTY TAX AND THE RISING COST OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, THERE IS A COMPELLING
25 INTEREST TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE TO LOWER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAX RATES FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCES,
26 WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS SECTION AND 15-10-420.
27 (3) AFTER [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION], A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A
28 SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED, EITHER BY CHARTER OR BY VOTER APPROVAL MAY:
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.5
1 (A) ELECT TO TRANSITION A VOTED MILL LEVY TO A DOLLAR-BASED MILL LEVY EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF
2 PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025 AND THEREAFTER SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF 15-10-420(1)(A);
3 OR
4 (B) LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2026 THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
5 TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL LEVY THE
6 NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.
7
8 NEW SECTION. SECTION 8. REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOSS OF REVENUE FROM CERTAIN FIXED MILL LEVIES.
9 (1) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL REIMBURSE EACH TAXING ENTITY AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION FOR THE REVENUE LOSS
10 RESULTING FROM THE TAX RATE REDUCTIONS IN 15-6-134 AS AMENDED BY [THIS ACT] FOR THE FOLLOWING LEVIES:
11 (A) LEVIES OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A CHARTER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT INCLUDES A MILL
12 LEVY LIMIT OF A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE CHARTER; AND
13 (B) LEVIES STATED AS A SPECIFIC MILL LEVY AUTHORIZED BY VOTERS BEFORE [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
14 THIS SECTION].
15 (2) (a) FOR FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
16 PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1) AND THE PROPERTY TAX
17 REVENUE COLLECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. AFTER FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE
18 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1)
19 AND THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE THAT WOULD BE COLLECTED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR USING THE MILL LEVY THAT
20 WOULD RAISE THE FISCAL YEAR 2025 TAX REVENUE USING THE FISCAL YEAR 2026 TAXABLE VALUE.
21 (b) A reimbursement pursuant to this section must include any fines, penalties, or damages
22 resulting from a judgment levy against the taxing entity in levying property taxes in accordance with [section 7].
23 (3) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in
24 revenue from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] and any amount reimbursable under
25 subsection (2)(b) to the department of revenue.
26 (3) (4) A REIMBURSEMENT PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SECTION MAY ONLY BE MADE FOR 4 YEARS AFTER [THE
27 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION].
28 (4) (5) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL DISTRIBUTE THE REIMBURSEMENTS WITH THE ENTITLEMENT SHARE
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

3 SECTION 12. SECTION 15-1-121, MCA, IS AMENDED TO READ:
4 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
5 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
6 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
7 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
8 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
9 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
10 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
11 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
12 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
13 sending a portion to other local governments.
14 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
15 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
16 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),
17 Chapter 584, Laws of 1999;

25 amendment of 61-3-509 in 2001;
26 (vii) Title 61, chapter 3, part 7;
27 (viii) 5% of the fees collected under 61-10-122;

3 (c) gaming revenue pursuant to Title 23, chapter 5, part 6, except for the permit fee in 23-5-
4 612(2)(a);

15 (ii) 16-1-406; and
16 (iii) 16-1-411;
17 (h) late filing fees pursuant to 61-3-220;

23 (n) state aeronautics fees pursuant to 67-3-101; and
24 (o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
25 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
26 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
27 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
28 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.5
1 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
2 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
3 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
4 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
5 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
6 year.
7 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
8 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
9 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
10 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
11 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
12 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
13 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
14 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
15 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
16 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
17 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
18 multiplied by 0.25.
19 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
20 the lesser of:
21 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
22 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
23 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
24 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
25 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
26 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
27 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
28 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.5
1 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
2 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
3 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
4 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
5 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
6 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
7 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
8 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
9 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
10 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
11 2002.
12 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
13 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
14 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
15 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
16 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
17 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
18 be calculated separately for:
19 (A) counties;
20 (B) consolidated local governments; and
21 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
22 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
23 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
24 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
25 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
26 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
27 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
28 United States bureau of the census.
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.5
1 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
2 follows:
3 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
4 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
5 and
6 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
7 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
8 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
9 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
10 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
11 follows:
12 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
13 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
14 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
15 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
16 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
17 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
18 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
19 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
20 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
21 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
22 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
23 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
24 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
25 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
26 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
27 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
28 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.5
1 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
2 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
3 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
4 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
5 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
6 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
7 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
8 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
9 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 8].
10 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
11 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
12 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
13 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
14 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
15 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
16 financing districts is as follows:
FLATHEAD Kalispell - District 2 $4,638
Flathead Kalispell - District 3 37,231
Flathead Whitefish District 148,194
Gallatin Bozeman - downtown 31,158
Missoula Missoula - 1-1C 225,251
Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
17 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
18 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
19 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
20 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
21 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
22 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.

1 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
2 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
3 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
4 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
5 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
6 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
7 (i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and
8 (ii) fails to remit any amounts collected on behalf of the state as required by 15-1-504 or as
9 otherwise required by law within 45 days of the end of a month.

1 (B) If a property owner has exhausted the right to object to a valuation, as provided for in
2 subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
3 adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
4 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
5 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
6 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a
7 business, including bankruptcies, acquisitions, sales of assets, or mergers.
8 (b) If the objection relates to residential or commercial property and the objector agrees to the
9 confidentiality requirements, the department shall provide to the objector, by posted mail or electronically, within
10 8 weeks of submission of the objection, the following information:
11 (i) the methodology and sources of data used by the department in the valuation of the property;

14 the methodology was used.
15 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
16 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
17 electronic form:
18 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;

23 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
24 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
25 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
26 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures

- 27 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.5
1 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent

6 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
7 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
8 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
9 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
10 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
11 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
12 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
13 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
14 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
15 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
16 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
17 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
18 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
19 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing

24 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
25 office hours.
26 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
27 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
28 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,

2 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
3 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
4 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
5 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
6 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
7 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
8 accordance with the board's order."
