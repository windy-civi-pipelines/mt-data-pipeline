3 subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
4 adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
5 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
6 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
7 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a

17 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
18 electronic form:
19 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
20 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's

7 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
8 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
9 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
10 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
11 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
12 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
13 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
14 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
15 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
16 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
17 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
18 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
19 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
20 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
21 for making the adjustment.

24 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
25 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
26 office hours.

6 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as

14 2-year valuation cycle. An objection made more than 30 days from the date of the classification and appraisal
15 notice will be applicable only for the second year of the 2-year valuation cycle. For an objection to apply to the
16 second year of the valuation cycle, the taxpayer shall make the objection in writing or by checking a box on the
17 notice no later than June 1 of the second year of the valuation cycle or, if a classification and appraisal notice is

1 of the valuation cycle, within the time period specified in subsection (3)(a)(iii).
2 (B) If a property owner has exhausted the right to object to a valuation, as provided for in
3 subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
4 adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
5 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
6 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
7 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a
8 business, including bankruptcies, acquisitions, sales of assets, or mergers.
9 (b) If the objection relates to residential or commercial property and the objector agrees to the
10 confidentiality requirements, the department shall provide to the objector, by posted mail or electronically, within
11 8 weeks of submission of the objection, the following information:
12 (i) the methodology and sources of data used by the department in the valuation of the property;
13 and
14 (ii) if the department uses a blend of evaluations developed from various sources, the reasons that
15 the methodology was used.
16 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
17 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
18 electronic form:
19 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
20 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
21 market model area; and
22 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the
23 documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.
24 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
25 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
26 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
27 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
28 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual

1 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
2 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
3 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
4 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
5 department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
6 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
7 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
8 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
9 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
10 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
11 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
12 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
13 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
14 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
15 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
16 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
17 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
18 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
19 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
20 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
21 for making the adjustment.
22 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
23 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
24 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
25 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
26 office hours.
27 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
28 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property

3 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
4 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
5 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
6 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
7 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
