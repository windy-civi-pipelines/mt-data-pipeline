28 second year of the valuation cycle, the taxpayer shall make the objection in writing or by checking a box on the
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.3
1 notice no later than June 1 of the second year of the valuation cycle or, if a classification and appraisal notice is

9 for both years of the 2-year valuation cycle. An objection made after the deadline specified in subsection

11 the second year of the valuation cycle, the taxpayer shall make the objection in writing no later than June 1 of
12 the second year of the valuation cycle or, if a classification and appraisal notice is received in the second year
13 of the valuation cycle, within the time period specified in subsection (3)(a)(iii).
14 (B) If a property owner has exhausted the right to object to a valuation, as provided for in
15 subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
16 adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
17 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
18 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
19 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a
20 business, including bankruptcies, acquisitions, sales of assets, or mergers.
21 (b) If the objection relates to residential or commercial property and the objector agrees to the
22 confidentiality requirements, the department shall provide to the objector, by posted mail or electronically, within
23 8 weeks of submission of the objection, the following information:
24 (i) the methodology and sources of data used by the department in the valuation of the property;
25 and
26 (ii) if the department uses a blend of evaluations developed from various sources, the reasons that
27 the methodology was used.
28 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.3
1 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
2 electronic form:
3 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
4 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
5 market model area; and
6 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the
7 documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.
8 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
9 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
10 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
11 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
12 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
13 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
14 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
15 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
16 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
17 department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
18 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
19 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
20 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
21 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
22 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
23 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
24 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
25 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
26 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
27 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
28 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.3
1 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
2 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
3 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
4 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
5 for making the adjustment.
6 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
7 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
8 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
9 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
10 office hours.
11 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
12 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
13 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
14 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
15 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
16 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
17 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
18 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
19 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
20 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
21 accordance with the board's order."

13 of the date of the mailing or the date when the taxpayer is informed the information is available electronically.
14 (3) (a) If the owner of any land and improvements is dissatisfied with the appraisal as it reflects the
15 market value of the property as determined by the department or with the classification of the land or
16 improvements, the owner may request an informal classification and appraisal review by submitting an
17 objection on written or electronic forms provided by the department for that purpose or by checking a box on the

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.3

14 (B) If a property owner has exhausted the right to object to a valuation, as provided for in
15 subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
16 adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
17 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
18 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
19 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a
20 business, including bankruptcies, acquisitions, sales of assets, or mergers.
21 (b) If the objection relates to residential or commercial property and the objector agrees to the
22 confidentiality requirements, the department shall provide to the objector, by posted mail or electronically, within
23 8 weeks of submission of the objection, the following information:
24 (i) the methodology and sources of data used by the department in the valuation of the property;
25 and

27 the methodology was used.
28 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.3
1 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
2 electronic form:
3 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
4 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
5 market model area; and
6 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the
7 documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.
8 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
9 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
10 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
11 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
12 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
13 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
14 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
15 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
16 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
17 department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
18 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
19 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
20 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
21 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
22 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
23 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
24 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
25 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
26 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
27 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
28 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.3
1 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
2 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
3 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
4 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
5 for making the adjustment.
6 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
7 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
8 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
9 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
10 office hours.
11 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
12 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
13 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
14 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
15 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
16 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
17 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
18 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
19 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
20 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
21 accordance with the board's order."
