14 subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
15 adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
16 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
17 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
18 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a

1 electronic form:
2 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
3 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
4 market model area; and
5 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the

7 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
8 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
9 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
10 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
11 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
12 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
13 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
14 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
15 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the

17 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
18 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
19 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
20 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
21 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
22 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
23 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
24 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
25 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
26 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
27 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
28 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:

2 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
3 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
4 for making the adjustment.
5 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
6 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
7 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
8 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
9 office hours.
10 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
11 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
12 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
13 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
14 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
15 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
16 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
17 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
18 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
19 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
20 accordance with the board's order."

23 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
24 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
25 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
26 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.

14 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
15 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
16 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
17 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
18 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board

3 Section 13. Section 15-15-103, MCA, is amended to read:
4 "15-15-103. Examination of applicant -- failure to hear application. (1) Before the county tax
5 appeal board grants any application or makes any reduction applied for, it shall examine on oath the person or
6 agent making the application with regard to the value of the property of the person or eligibility for the
7 homestead reduced tax rate provided for in [section 2 or 3], the certified additional residence reduced tax rate
8 provided for in [section 4], or the rental property reduced tax rate provided for in [section 4 5]. A reduction may
9 not be made unless the applicant makes an application, as provided in 15-15-102, and attends the county
10 board hearing. An appeal of the county board's decision may not be made to the Montana tax appeal board
11 unless the person or the person's agent has exhausted the remedies available through the county board. In
12 order to exhaust the remedies, the person or the person's agent shall attend the county board hearing. On
13 written request by the person or the person's agent and on the written concurrence of the department, the
14 county board may waive the requirement that the person or the person's agent attend the hearing. The
15 testimony of all witnesses at the hearing and the deliberation of the county tax appeal board in rendering a
16 decision must be electronically recorded and preserved for 1 year. If the decision of the county board is
17 appealed, the record of the proceedings, including the electronic recording of all testimony and the deliberation
18 of the county tax appeal board, must be forwarded, together with all exhibits, to the Montana board. The date of
19 the hearing, the proceedings before the county board, and the decision must be entered upon the minutes of
20 the county board, and the county board shall notify the applicant of its decision by mail within 3 days. A copy of
21 the minutes of the county board must be transmitted to the Montana board no later than 3 days after the county
22 board holds its final hearing of the year.
23 (2) (a) Except as provided in 15-15-201, if a county board refuses or fails to hear a taxpayer's
24 timely application for a reduction in valuation of property or eligibility for a reduced tax rate, the taxpayer's
25 application is considered to be granted on the day following the county board's final meeting for that year. The
26 department shall enter the appraisal, or classification, or tax rate sought in the application in the property tax
27 record. An application is not automatically granted for the following appeals:
28 (i) those listed in 15-2-302(1); and

1 (ii) if a taxpayer's appeal from the department's determination of classification or appraisal made
2 pursuant to 15-7-102 was not received in time, as provided for in 15-15-102, to be considered by the county
3 board during its current session.
4 (b) The county board shall provide written notification of each application that was automatically
5 granted pursuant to subsection (2)(a) to the department, the Montana board, and any affected municipal
6 corporation. The notice must include the name of the taxpayer and a description of the subject property.
7 (3) The county tax appeal board shall consider an independent appraisal provided by the taxpayer
8 if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate appraisers and the appraisal was
9 conducted within 6 months of the valuation date. If the county tax appeal board does not use the appraisal
10 provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the county board shall provide to the taxpayer the reason for
11 not using the appraisal."

15 receipt of the property tax record, the county treasurer shall publish a notice specifying:
16 (a) that one-half of all taxes levied and assessed will be due and payable before 5 p.m. on the next
17 November 30 or within 30 days after the notice is postmarked and that unless paid prior to that time the amount
18 then due will be delinquent and will draw interest at the rate of 5/6 of 1% a month from the time of delinquency
19 until paid and 2% will be added to the delinquent taxes as a penalty;
20 (b) that one-half of all taxes levied and assessed will be due and payable on or before 5 p.m. on
21 the next May 31 and that unless paid prior to that time the taxes will be delinquent and will draw interest at the
22 rate of 5/6 of 1% a month from the time of delinquency until paid and 2% will be added to the delinquent taxes
23 as a penalty; and

1 (ii) the total mill levy applied to that taxable value;
2 (iii) itemized city services and special improvement district assessments collected by the county;
3 (iv) the number of the school district in which the property is located;
4 (v) the amount of the total tax due itemized by mill levy that is levied as city tax, county tax, state
5 tax, school district tax, and other tax;
6 (vi) an indication of which mill levies are voted levies, including voted levies to impose a new mill
7 levy, to increase a mill levy that is required to be submitted to the electors, or to exceed the mill levy limit
8 provided for in 15-10-420;
9 (vii) except as provided in subsection (2)(c), an itemization of the taxes due for each mill levy and a
10 comparison to the amount due for each mill levy in the prior year; and
11 (viii) a notice of the availability of all the property tax assistance programs available to property
12 taxpayers, including the intangible land value assistance program provided for in 15-6-240, the property tax
13 assistance programs under Title 15, chapter 6, part 3, the homestead reduced tax rate provided for in [section
14 3], the certified additional residence reduced tax rate provided for in [section 4], the rental property reduced tax
15 rate provided for in [section 4 5], and the residential property tax credit for the elderly under 15-30-2337 through
16 15-30-2341.
17 (b) If a tax lien is attached to the property, the notice must also include, in a manner calculated to
18 draw attention, a statement that a tax lien is attached to the property, that failure to respond will result in loss of
19 property, and that the taxpayer may contact the county treasurer for complete information.
20 (c) The information required in subsection (2)(a)(vii) may be posted on the county treasurer's
21 website instead of being included on the written notice.
22 (3) The municipality shall, upon request of the county treasurer, provide the information to be
23 included under subsection (2)(a)(iii) ready for mailing.
24 (4) The notice in every case must be given as provided in 7-1-2121. Failure to publish or post
25 notices does not relieve the taxpayer from any tax liability. Any failure to give notice of the tax due for the
26 current year or of delinquent tax will not affect the legality of the tax.
27 (5) If the department revises an assessment that results in an additional tax of $5 or less, an
28 additional tax is not owed and a new tax bill does not need to be prepared."
