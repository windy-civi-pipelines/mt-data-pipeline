1 circumstances include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are material in
2 nature and of a character different from the typical or customary, and that are not expected to recur.
3 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
4 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
5 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
6 (2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review

16
17 NEW SECTION. SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS AND FIXED MILL
18 LEVY LIMITS SUPERSEDED -- DEFINITION. (1) (A) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SET MILL
19 LEVIES THAT ADJUST DOWNWARD WHEN TAXABLE VALUE INCREASES UNDER 15-10-420. THIS FLOATING MILL LEVY
20 CONCEPT AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES
21 INCREASE, WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE
22 OCCURS WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR
23 TAXPAYERS THAT ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
24 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
25 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO
26 RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THE POWER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 5, OF THE MONTANA
27 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.

1 (2) AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO SUPERSEDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS
2 THAT FIX MILL LEVY LIMITS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF EXERCISING THE POWER TO TAX WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING
3 LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCES WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS. HAVING CONSIDERED
4 ALL OPTIONS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THE STATUTORY STRUCTURE OF THE PROPERTY TAX HAS
5 EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF INITIATIVE MEASURE NO. 105 ON NOVEMBER 4, 1986, AND THE
6 ENACTMENT OF 15-10-420 BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 1999. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
7 PROPERTY TAX AND THE RISING COST OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, THERE IS A COMPELLING
8 INTEREST TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE TO LOWER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAX RATES FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCES,
9 WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS SECTION AND 15-10-420.
10 (3) AFTER [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION], A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A
11 SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED, EITHER BY CHARTER OR BY VOTER APPROVAL MAY:
12 (3) A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A CHARTER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT INCLUDES A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF
13 A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE CHARTER SHALL LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR
14 2026 AND SUBSEQUENT TAX YEARS THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR
15 2025, WITHOUT AMENDING OR REVISING THE CHARTER. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL
16 LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.
17 (4) A TAXING ENTITY WITH A LOCAL MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE
18 IMPOSED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY THAT WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE VOTERS BEFORE [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION]

20 (A) ELECT TO TRANSITION A VOTED MILL PUBLIC SAFETY LEVY TO A DOLLAR-BASED MILL LEVY EQUAL TO
21 THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025 AND THEREAFTER SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
22 15-10-420(1)(A); OR
23 (B) LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2026 THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
24 TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL LEVY THE
25 NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.

11 PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1) AND THE PROPERTY TAX
12 REVENUE COLLECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. AFTER FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE

16 (B) A REIMBURSEMENT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION MUST INCLUDE ANY FINES, PENALTIES, OR DAMAGES
17 RESULTING FROM A JUDGMENT LEVY AGAINST THE TAXING ENTITY IN LEVYING PROPERTY TAXES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

6 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
7 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
8 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
9 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
10 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
11 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
12 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
13 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
14 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
15 sending a portion to other local governments.
16 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
17 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
18 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),
19 Chapter 584, Laws of 1999;
20 (b) vehicle, boat, and aircraft taxes and fees pursuant to:

1 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
2 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
3 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
4 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
5 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
6 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
7 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
8 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
9 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
10 year.
11 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
12 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
13 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
14 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
15 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
16 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
17 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
18 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
19 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
20 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
21 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
22 multiplied by 0.25.
23 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
24 the lesser of:
25 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
26 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
27 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),

Committee on HB 231

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Jaret Coles, HB0231.005.005
1 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
2 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
3 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
4 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
5 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
6 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
7 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
8 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
9 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
10 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
11 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
12 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
13 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
14 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
15 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
16 2002.
17 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
18 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
19 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
20 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
21 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
22 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
23 be calculated separately for:
24 (A) counties;
25 (B) consolidated local governments; and
26 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
27 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:

Committee on HB 231
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Jaret Coles, HB0231.005.005
1 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
2 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
3 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
4 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
5 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
6 United States bureau of the census.
7 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
8 follows:
9 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
10 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
11 and
12 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
13 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
14 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
15 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
16 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
17 follows:
18 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
19 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
20 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
21 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
22 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
23 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
24 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
25 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
26 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
27 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

1 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
2 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
3 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
4 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
5 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
6 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
7 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
8 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
9 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
10 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
11 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
12 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
13 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
14 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
15 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
16 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 8].
17 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
18 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
19 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
20 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
21 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
22 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
23 financing districts is as follows:

1 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
2 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
3 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
4 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
5 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
6 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
7 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
8 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
9 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
10 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
11 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
12 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:

2 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
3 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
4 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
5 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must

23 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
24 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
25 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
26 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
