20 an application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax rate, the owner may request

Amendment - 1st Reading/2nd House-blue - Requested by: Greg Hertz - (S) Taxation
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, HB0231.003.015
1 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
2 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
3 (2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review
4 provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board
5 and then to the Montana tax appeal board, whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts.
6 An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
7 the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
8 determines that the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate should apply, the
9 department shall adjust the taxable value of the property in accordance with the board's order.
10
11 NEW SECTION. Section 7. Rulemaking authority. The department shall adopt rules that are
12 necessary to implement and administer [sections 1 through 7].
13
14 NEW SECTION. Section 8. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
15 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments have transitioned to mill levies that
16 adjust downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically
17 lowers the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases
18 in property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
19 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
20 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
21 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
22 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
23 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
24 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
25 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
26 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
27 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
28 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, HB0231.003.015
1 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
2 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
3 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
4 (3) After [the effective date of this section], a local government with a mill levy limit of a specific
5 number of mills that may be imposed, either by charter or by voter approval, shall levy the number of mills in
6 fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years
7 after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills levied in fiscal year 2026.
8
9 NEW SECTION. Section 9. Reimbursement for loss of revenue from certain fixed mill levies. (1)
10 The department shall reimburse each taxing entity as provided in this section for the revenue loss resulting from
11 the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] for the following levies:
12 (a) levies of a local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a
13 specific number of mills that may be imposed in the charter; and
14 (b) levies stated as a specific mill levy authorized by voters before [the effective date of this
15 section].
16 (2) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the property
17 tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue collected in
18 fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
19 property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue that
20 would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax revenue
21 using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
22 (3) A reimbursement provided for in this section may only be made for 4 years after [the effective
23 date of this section].
24 (4) The department shall distribute the reimbursements with the entitlement share payments under
25 15-1-121(7).
26
27 Section 10. Section 15-1-121, MCA, is amended to read:

1 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
2 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
3 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
4 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
5 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
6 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
7 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
8 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
9 sending a portion to other local governments.
10 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
11 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
12 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),

23 (viii) 5% of the fees collected under 61-10-122;

25 (x) 61-10-148; and

20 (o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
21 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
22 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
23 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
24 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
25 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
26 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
27 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
28 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The

1 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
2 year.
3 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
4 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
5 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
6 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
7 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
8 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
9 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
10 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
11 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
12 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
13 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
14 multiplied by 0.25.
15 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is

17 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
18 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
19 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
20 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
21 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
22 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
23 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
24 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
25 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
26 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated

1 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
2 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
3 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
4 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
5 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
6 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
7 2002.
8 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
9 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
10 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
11 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
12 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
13 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
14 be calculated separately for:
15 (A) counties;
16 (B) consolidated local governments; and
17 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
18 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
19 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
20 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
21 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
22 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
23 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
24 United States bureau of the census.
25 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
26 follows:
27 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
28 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;

1 and
2 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
3 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
4 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
5 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
6 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
7 follows:
8 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
9 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
10 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
11 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
12 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
13 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
14 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
15 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
16 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
17 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
18 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
19 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
20 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
21 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
22 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
23 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
24 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
25 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
26 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
27 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
28 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth

2 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
3 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
4 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
5 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 9].
6 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
7 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
8 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
9 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
10 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
11 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
12 financing districts is as follows:

Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
13 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
14 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
15 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
16 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
17 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
18 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
19 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
20 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
21 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.

17 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
18 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
19 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
20 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
21 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
22 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
23 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
24 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
25 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
26 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust

16 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
17 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board

2 appeal board grants any application or makes any reduction applied for, it shall examine on oath the person or
3 agent making the application with regard to the value of the property of the person or eligibility for the

12 (a) that one-half of all taxes levied and assessed will be due and payable before 5 p.m. on the next
13 November 30 or within 30 days after the notice is postmarked and that unless paid prior to that time the amount
14 then due will be delinquent and will draw interest at the rate of 5/6 of 1% a month from the time of delinquency

18 included under subsection (2)(a)(iii) ready for mailing.
19 (4) The notice in every case must be given as provided in 7-1-2121. Failure to publish or post
20 notices does not relieve the taxpayer from any tax liability. Any failure to give notice of the tax due for the
21 current year or of delinquent tax will not affect the legality of the tax.

23 additional tax is not owed and a new tax bill does not need to be prepared."
