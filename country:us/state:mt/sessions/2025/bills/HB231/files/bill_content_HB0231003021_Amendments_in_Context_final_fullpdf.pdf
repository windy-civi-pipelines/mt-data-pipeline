4 second year of the valuation cycle, the taxpayer shall make the objection in writing or by checking a box on the
5 notice no later than June 1 of the second year of the valuation cycle or, if a classification and appraisal notice is
6 received in the second year of the valuation cycle, within 30 days from the date on the notice.

18 (B) If a property owner has exhausted the right to object to a valuation, as provided for in
19 subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
20 adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
21 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
22 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
23 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a

26 confidentiality requirements, the department shall provide to the objector, by posted mail or electronically, within

1 and
2 (ii) if the department uses a blend of evaluations developed from various sources, the reasons that
3 the methodology was used.
4 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
5 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
6 electronic form:
7 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
8 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
9 market model area; and
10 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the
11 documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.
12 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
13 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
14 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
15 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
16 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
17 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
18 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
19 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
20 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
21 department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
22 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
23 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
24 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
25 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
26 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
27 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
28 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for

1 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
2 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
3 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
4 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
5 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
6 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
7 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
8 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
9 for making the adjustment.
10 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
11 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
12 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
13 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
14 office hours.
15 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
16 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
17 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
18 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
19 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
20 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
21 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
22 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
23 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
24 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
25 accordance with the board's order."
