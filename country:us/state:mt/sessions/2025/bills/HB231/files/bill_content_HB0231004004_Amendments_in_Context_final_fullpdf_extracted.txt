1 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead

14
15 NEW SECTION. SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS AND FIXED MILL
16 LEVY LIMITS SUPERSEDED -- definition. (1) (A) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SET MILL
17 LEVIES THAT ADJUST DOWNWARD WHEN TAXABLE VALUE INCREASES UNDER 15-10-420. THIS FLOATING MILL LEVY
18 CONCEPT AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES
19 INCREASE, WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE
20 OCCURS WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR
21 TAXPAYERS THAT ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
22 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
23 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO
24 RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THE POWER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 5, OF THE MONTANA
25 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.
26 (2) AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO SUPERSEDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS
27 THAT FIX MILL LEVY LIMITS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF EXERCISING THE POWER TO TAX WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING

1 LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCES WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS. HAVING CONSIDERED
2 ALL OPTIONS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THE STATUTORY STRUCTURE OF THE PROPERTY TAX HAS
3 EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF INITIATIVE MEASURE NO. 105 ON NOVEMBER 4, 1986, AND THE
4 ENACTMENT OF 15-10-420 BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 1999. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
5 PROPERTY TAX AND THE RISING COST OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, THERE IS A COMPELLING
6 INTEREST TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE TO LOWER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAX RATES FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCES,
7 WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS SECTION AND 15-10-420.
8 (3) AFTER [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION], A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A
9 SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED, EITHER BY CHARTER OR BY VOTER APPROVAL MAY:

11 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
12 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
13 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
14 levied in fiscal year 2026.
15 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed for
16 public safety that was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section] may:
17 (A) ELECT TO TRANSITION A VOTED MILL public safety LEVY TO A DOLLAR-BASED MILL LEVY EQUAL TO THE
18 AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025 AND THEREAFTER SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF 15-
19 10-420(1)(A); OR
20 (B) LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2026 THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
21 TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL LEVY THE
22 NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.
23 (5) As used in this section, "public safety" means police, fire, and emergency medical services.
24
25 NEW SECTION. SECTION 8. REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOSS OF REVENUE FROM CERTAIN FIXED MILL LEVIES --

5 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION act].
6 (2) FOR FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
7 PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1) AND THE PROPERTY TAX
8 REVENUE COLLECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. AFTER FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE
9 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1)
10 AND THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE THAT WOULD BE COLLECTED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR USING THE MILL LEVY THAT
11 WOULD RAISE THE FISCAL YEAR 2025 TAX REVENUE USING THE FISCAL YEAR 2026 TAXABLE VALUE.
12 (3) A REIMBURSEMENT PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SECTION MAY ONLY BE MADE FOR 4 YEARS AFTER [THE
13 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION].
14 (4) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL DISTRIBUTE THE REIMBURSEMENTS WITH THE ENTITLEMENT SHARE
15 PAYMENTS UNDER 15-1-121(7).

23 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
24 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
25 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and

2 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
3 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
4 sending a portion to other local governments.
5 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
6 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
7 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),

16 (o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
17 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
18 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
19 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
20 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
21 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
22 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
23 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
24 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
25 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
26 year.
27 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement

Whole
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, HB0231.004.004
1 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
2 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
3 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
4 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
5 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
6 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
7 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
8 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
9 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
10 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
11 multiplied by 0.25.
12 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
13 the lesser of:
14 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
15 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
16 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
17 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
18 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
19 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
20 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
21 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
22 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
23 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
24 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
25 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
26 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
27 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an

1 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
2 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
3 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
4 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
5 2002.
6 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
7 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
8 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
9 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
10 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
11 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
12 be calculated separately for:
13 (A) counties;
14 (B) consolidated local governments; and
15 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
16 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
17 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
18 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
19 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
20 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
21 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
22 United States bureau of the census.
23 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
24 follows:
25 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
26 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;

1 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
2 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
3 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
4 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
5 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
6 follows:
7 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
8 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
9 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
10 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
11 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
12 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
13 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
14 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
15 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
16 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
17 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
18 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
19 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
20 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
21 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
22 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
23 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
24 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
25 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
26 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
27 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth

1 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
2 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
3 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
4 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
5 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 8].
6 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
7 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
8 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
9 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
10 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
11 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
12 financing districts is as follows:
FLATHEAD Kalispell - District 2 $4,638
Flathead Kalispell - District 3 37,231
Flathead Whitefish District 148,194
Gallatin Bozeman - downtown 31,158
Missoula Missoula - 1-1C 225,251
Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
13 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
14 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
15 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
16 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
17 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
18 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
19 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
20 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
21 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.

2 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
3 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures

11 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
12 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
13 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
14 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
15 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
16 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
17 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
18 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
19 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
20 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
21 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
22 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
23 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
24 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
25 for making the adjustment.

7 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
8 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
9 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
10 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
11 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
12 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
13 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
14 accordance with the board's order."

16 department determines that an application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax
17 rate was improperly approved OR THAT THE PROPERTY NO LONGER QUALIFIES FOR THE REDUCED RATE, the
18 department shall revise the assessment for each year the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property
19 reduced tax rate was improperly granted subject to the assessment revision procedure established in 15-8-601.
20 (2) (a) A person who files a false or fraudulent application for a homestead reduced tax rate

7 (4) If the person who filed a false or fraudulent application no longer owns the property associated
8 with the false or fraudulent application, the penalty plus interest provided for in subsection (3) may be recovered
9 as any other tax owed the state. If the penalty plus interest becomes due and owing, the department may issue
10 a warrant for distraint as provided in Title 15, chapter 1, part 7.
11 (5) Except as provided in subsection (4), if the department determines that a false or fraudulent

1 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
2 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
3 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
4 (2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review
5 provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board

7 An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
8 the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board

16 LEVY LIMITS SUPERSEDED -- definition. (1) (A) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SET MILL
17 LEVIES THAT ADJUST DOWNWARD WHEN TAXABLE VALUE INCREASES UNDER 15-10-420. THIS FLOATING MILL LEVY
18 CONCEPT AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES
19 INCREASE, WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE
20 OCCURS WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR
21 TAXPAYERS THAT ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
22 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
23 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO
24 RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THE POWER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 5, OF THE MONTANA
25 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.

11 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
12 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without

14 levied in fiscal year 2026.
15 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed for
16 public safety that was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section] may:

18 AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025 AND THEREAFTER SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF 15-
19 10-420(1)(A); OR
20 (B) LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2026 THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
21 TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL LEVY THE
22 NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.

7 PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1) AND THE PROPERTY TAX
8 REVENUE COLLECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. AFTER FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE

18 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
19 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
20 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
21 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
22 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.

1 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
2 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
3 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
4 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
5 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
6 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
7 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
8 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
9 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
10 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
11 multiplied by 0.25.
12 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
13 the lesser of:
14 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
15 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
16 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
17 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
18 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
19 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
20 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
21 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
22 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
23 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
24 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
25 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
26 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
27 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an

1 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
2 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
3 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
4 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
5 2002.

12 be calculated separately for:
13 (A) counties;
14 (B) consolidated local governments; and
15 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
16 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
17 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
18 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
19 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
20 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by

1 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
2 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
3 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
4 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
5 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as

7 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
8 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
9 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
10 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
11 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
12 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
13 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
14 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
15 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
16 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
17 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
18 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
19 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
20 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
21 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
22 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).

6 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
7 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
8 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
9 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
10 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30

13 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
14 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
15 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
16 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
17 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
18 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
19 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
20 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
21 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
