14 COORDINATION SECTION. Section 27. Coordination instruction. If both Senate Bill No. 542 and
15 [this act] are passed and approved, then [sections 1 through 23 and 25 of this act] are void and [section 4 of
16 Senate Bill No. 542] must be amended as follows:
17 "NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill
18 levy limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
19 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
20 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
21 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
22 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
23 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
24 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
25 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
26 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
27 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill

1 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
2 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
3 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
4 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
5 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
6 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
7 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
8 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
9 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
10 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
11 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall may levy an amount not
12 to exceed the number of mills levied in fiscal year 2026.
13 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
14 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:
15 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
16 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
17 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
18 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall may levy an amount not to
19 exceed the number of mills levied in fiscal year 2026."

21 NEW SECTION. Section 28. Applicability -- retroactive applicability. (1) Except as provided in
22 subsection (2), [this act] applies retroactively to property tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.
23 (2) [Sections 3 and 4 1 THROUGH 6, 13, AND 15 THROUGH 20] apply to property tax years beginning
24 after December 31, 2026 2025.

26 NEW SECTION. Section 19. Termination. [ Section 2 ] and the references to [section 2] in [section 5
