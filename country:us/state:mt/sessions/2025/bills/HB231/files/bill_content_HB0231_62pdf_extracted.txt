6 necessary to implement and administer [sections 1 through 7 6].
7
8 NEW SECTION. SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS AND FIXED MILL
9 LEVY LIMITS SUPERSEDED -- DEFINITION. (1) (A) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SET MILL
10 LEVIES THAT ADJUST DOWNWARD WHEN TAXABLE VALUE INCREASES UNDER 15-10-420. THIS FLOATING MILL LEVY
11 CONCEPT AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES
12 INCREASE, WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE
13 OCCURS WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR
14 TAXPAYERS THAT ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
15 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
16 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO
17 RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THE POWER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 5, OF THE MONTANA
18 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.
19 (2) AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO SUPERSEDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS
20 THAT FIX MILL LEVY LIMITS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF EXERCISING THE POWER TO TAX WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING
21 LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCES WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS. HAVING CONSIDERED
22 ALL OPTIONS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THE STATUTORY STRUCTURE OF THE PROPERTY TAX HAS
23 EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF INITIATIVE MEASURE NO. 105 ON NOVEMBER 4, 1986, AND THE
24 ENACTMENT OF 15-10-420 BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 1999. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
25 PROPERTY TAX AND THE RISING COST OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, THERE IS A COMPELLING
26 INTEREST TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE TO LOWER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAX RATES FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCES,
27 WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS SECTION AND 15-10-420.
28 (3) AFTER [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION], A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
- 2025

2 (3) A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A CHARTER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT INCLUDES A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF
3 A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE CHARTER SHALL LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR
4 2026 AND SUBSEQUENT TAX YEARS THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR
5 2025, WITHOUT AMENDING OR REVISING THE CHARTER. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL
6 LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.
7 (4) A TAXING ENTITY WITH A LOCAL MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE
8 IMPOSED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY THAT WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE VOTERS BEFORE [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION]
9 MAY:
10 (A) ELECT TO TRANSITION A VOTED MILL PUBLIC SAFETY LEVY TO A DOLLAR-BASED MILL LEVY EQUAL TO
11 THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025 AND THEREAFTER SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
12 15-10-420(1)(A); OR
13 (B) LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2026 THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
14 TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL LEVY THE
15 NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.
16 (5) AS USED IN THIS SECTION, "PUBLIC SAFETY" MEANS POLICE, FIRE, AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL
17 SERVICES.
18
19 NEW SECTION. SECTION 8. REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOSS OF REVENUE FROM CERTAIN FIXED MILL LEVIES --

2 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1)
3 AND THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE THAT WOULD BE COLLECTED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR USING THE MILL LEVY THAT
4 WOULD RAISE THE FISCAL YEAR 2025 TAX REVENUE USING THE FISCAL YEAR 2026 TAXABLE VALUE.
5 (B) A REIMBURSEMENT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION MUST INCLUDE ANY FINES, PENALTIES, OR DAMAGES
6 RESULTING FROM A JUDGMENT LEVY AGAINST THE TAXING ENTITY IN LEVYING PROPERTY TAXES IN ACCORDANCE WITH
7 [SECTION 7].
8 (3) A TAXING ENTITY ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A REIMBURSEMENT UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL REPORT THE

19 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
20 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
21 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
22 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
23 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
24 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
25 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
26 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
27 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
28 sending a portion to other local governments.

11 (o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
12 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
13 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
14 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
15 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
16 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
17 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
18 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
19 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
20 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
21 year.
22 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
23 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
24 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
25 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
26 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
27 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
28 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.6
1 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
2 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
3 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
4 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
5 multiplied by 0.25.
6 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
7 the lesser of:
8 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
9 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
10 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
11 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
12 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
13 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
14 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
15 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
16 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
17 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
18 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
19 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
20 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
21 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
22 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
23 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
24 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
25 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
26 2002.
27 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
28 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.6
1 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
2 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
3 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
4 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
5 be calculated separately for:
6 (A) counties;
7 (B) consolidated local governments; and
8 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
9 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
10 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
11 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
12 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
13 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
14 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
15 United States bureau of the census.
16 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
17 follows:
18 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
19 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
20 and
21 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
22 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
23 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
24 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
25 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
26 follows:
27 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
28 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.6
1 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
2 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
3 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
4 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
5 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
6 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
7 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
8 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
9 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
10 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
11 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
12 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
13 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
14 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
15 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
16 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
17 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
18 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
19 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
20 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
21 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
22 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
23 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
24 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 8].
25 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
26 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
27 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
28 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.

1 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
2 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
3 financing districts is as follows:
FLATHEAD Kalispell - District 2 $4,638
Flathead Kalispell - District 3 37,231
Flathead Whitefish District 148,194
Gallatin Bozeman - downtown 31,158
Missoula Missoula - 1-1C 225,251
Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
4 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
5 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
6 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
7 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
8 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
9 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
10 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
11 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
12 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
13 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
14 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
15 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
16 (i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and
17 (ii) fails to remit any amounts collected on behalf of the state as required by 15-1-504 or as
18 otherwise required by law within 45 days of the end of a month.

17 subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
18 adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
19 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
20 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
21 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a
22 business, including bankruptcies, acquisitions, sales of assets, or mergers.
23 (b) If the objection relates to residential or commercial property and the objector agrees to the
24 confidentiality requirements, the department shall provide to the objector, by posted mail or electronically, within
25 8 weeks of submission of the objection, the following information:
26 (i) the methodology and sources of data used by the department in the valuation of the property;
27 and
28 (ii) if the department uses a blend of evaluations developed from various sources, the reasons that
- 27 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.6
1 the methodology was used.
2 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
3 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
4 electronic form:
5 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
6 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
7 market model area; and
8 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the
9 documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.
10 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
11 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
12 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
13 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
14 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
15 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
16 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
17 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
18 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
19 department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
20 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
21 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
22 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
23 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
24 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
25 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
26 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
27 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
28 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
- 28 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.6
1 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
2 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
3 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
4 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
5 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
6 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
7 for making the adjustment.
8 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
9 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
10 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
11 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
12 office hours.
13 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
14 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
15 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
16 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
17 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
18 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
19 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
20 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
21 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
22 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
23 accordance with the board's order."

27 additional tax is not owed and a new tax bill does not need to be prepared."

3 AND [THIS ACT] ARE PASSED AND APPROVED, THEN [SECTIONS 1 THROUGH 23 AND 25 OF THIS ACT] ARE VOID AND
4 [SECTION 4 OF SENATE BILL NO. 542] MUST BE AMENDED AS FOLLOWS:
5 "NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill
6 levy limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
7 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
8 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
9 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
10 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
11 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
12 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
13 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
14 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
15 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
16 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
17 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
18 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
19 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
20 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
21 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
22 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
23 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
24 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
25 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
26 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall may levy an amount not
27 to exceed the number of mills levied in fiscal year 2026.
28 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
- 45 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.6
1 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:
2 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property

5 NEW SECTION. Section 6. Rulemaking authority. The department shall adopt rules that are
6 necessary to implement and administer [sections 1 through 7 6].
7
8 NEW SECTION. SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS AND FIXED MILL
9 LEVY LIMITS SUPERSEDED -- DEFINITION. (1) (A) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SET MILL
10 LEVIES THAT ADJUST DOWNWARD WHEN TAXABLE VALUE INCREASES UNDER 15-10-420. THIS FLOATING MILL LEVY
11 CONCEPT AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES
12 INCREASE, WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE
13 OCCURS WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR
14 TAXPAYERS THAT ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
15 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
16 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO
17 RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THE POWER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 5, OF THE MONTANA
18 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.
19 (2) AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO SUPERSEDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS
20 THAT FIX MILL LEVY LIMITS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF EXERCISING THE POWER TO TAX WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING
21 LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCES WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS. HAVING CONSIDERED
22 ALL OPTIONS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THE STATUTORY STRUCTURE OF THE PROPERTY TAX HAS
23 EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF INITIATIVE MEASURE NO. 105 ON NOVEMBER 4, 1986, AND THE
24 ENACTMENT OF 15-10-420 BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 1999. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
25 PROPERTY TAX AND THE RISING COST OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, THERE IS A COMPELLING
26 INTEREST TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE TO LOWER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAX RATES FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCES,
27 WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS SECTION AND 15-10-420.
28 (3) AFTER [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION], A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A

2 (3) A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A CHARTER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT INCLUDES A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF
3 A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE CHARTER SHALL LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR
4 2026 AND SUBSEQUENT TAX YEARS THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR
5 2025, WITHOUT AMENDING OR REVISING THE CHARTER. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL
6 LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.
7 (4) A TAXING ENTITY WITH A LOCAL MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE
8 IMPOSED FOR PUBLIC SAFETY THAT WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE VOTERS BEFORE [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION]
9 MAY:
10 (A) ELECT TO TRANSITION A VOTED MILL PUBLIC SAFETY LEVY TO A DOLLAR-BASED MILL LEVY EQUAL TO
11 THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025 AND THEREAFTER SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
12 15-10-420(1)(A); OR
13 (B) LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2026 THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
14 TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL LEVY THE
15 NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.
16 (5) AS USED IN THIS SECTION, "PUBLIC SAFETY" MEANS POLICE, FIRE, AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL
17 SERVICES.
18
19 NEW SECTION. SECTION 8. REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOSS OF REVENUE FROM CERTAIN FIXED MILL LEVIES --

24 LEVY LIMIT OF A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE CHARTER; AND

26 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION ACT].
27 (2) (A) FOR FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
28 PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1) AND THE PROPERTY TAX

2 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1)
3 AND THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE THAT WOULD BE COLLECTED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR USING THE MILL LEVY THAT
4 WOULD RAISE THE FISCAL YEAR 2025 TAX REVENUE USING THE FISCAL YEAR 2026 TAXABLE VALUE.
5 (B) A REIMBURSEMENT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION MUST INCLUDE ANY FINES, PENALTIES, OR DAMAGES
6 RESULTING FROM A JUDGMENT LEVY AGAINST THE TAXING ENTITY IN LEVYING PROPERTY TAXES IN ACCORDANCE WITH
7 [SECTION 7].
8 (3) A TAXING ENTITY ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A REIMBURSEMENT UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL REPORT THE
9 LOSS IN REVENUE FROM THE TAX RATE REDUCTIONS IN 15-6-134 AS AMENDED BY [THIS ACT] AND ANY AMOUNT

22 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
23 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
24 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
25 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
26 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,

16 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
17 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
18 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
19 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
20 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
21 year.
22 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
23 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
24 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
25 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
26 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
27 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
28 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.6
1 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
2 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
3 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
4 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
5 multiplied by 0.25.
6 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
7 the lesser of:
8 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
9 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
10 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
11 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
12 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
13 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
14 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
15 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
16 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
17 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
18 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
19 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
20 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
21 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
22 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
23 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
24 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
25 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
26 2002.
27 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
28 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.6
1 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
2 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
3 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
4 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
5 be calculated separately for:
6 (A) counties;
7 (B) consolidated local governments; and
8 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
9 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
10 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
11 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
12 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
13 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
14 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
15 United States bureau of the census.
16 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
17 follows:
18 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
19 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
20 and
21 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
22 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
23 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
24 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
25 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
26 follows:
27 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
28 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.6
1 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
2 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
3 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
4 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
5 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
6 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
7 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
8 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
9 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
10 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
11 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
12 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
13 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
14 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
15 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
16 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
17 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
18 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
19 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
20 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
21 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
22 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
23 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
24 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 8].
25 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
26 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
27 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
28 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.

1 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
2 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
3 financing districts is as follows:

Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
4 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
5 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
6 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
7 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
8 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
9 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
10 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
11 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
12 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
13 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
14 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
15 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
16 (i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and
17 (ii) fails to remit any amounts collected on behalf of the state as required by 15-1-504 or as

2 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
3 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
4 electronic form:
5 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
6 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
7 market model area; and
8 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the
9 documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.
10 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
11 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
12 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
13 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
14 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
15 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
16 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
17 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
18 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
19 department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
20 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
21 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
22 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
23 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
24 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
25 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
26 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
27 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
28 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.6
1 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
2 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
3 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
4 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
5 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
6 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
7 for making the adjustment.
8 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
9 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
10 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
11 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
12 office hours.
13 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
14 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
15 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
16 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
17 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
18 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
19 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
20 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
21 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
22 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
23 accordance with the board's order."

3 AND [THIS ACT] ARE PASSED AND APPROVED, THEN [SECTIONS 1 THROUGH 23 AND 25 OF THIS ACT] ARE VOID AND
4 [SECTION 4 OF SENATE BILL NO. 542] MUST BE AMENDED AS FOLLOWS:
5 "NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill
6 levy limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
7 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
8 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
9 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
10 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
11 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
12 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
13 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
14 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
15 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
16 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
17 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
18 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
19 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
20 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
21 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
22 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
23 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
24 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
25 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
26 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall may levy an amount not
27 to exceed the number of mills levied in fiscal year 2026.
28 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
- 45 - Authorized Print Version – HB 231

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0231.6
1 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:
2 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
3 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
4 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
5 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall may levy an amount not to
6 exceed the number of mills levied in fiscal year 2026."
