1 nature and of a character different from the typical or customary, and that are not expected to recur.
2 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
3 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
4 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
5 (2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review
6 provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board
7 and then to the Montana tax appeal board, whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts.
8 An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
9 the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
10 determines that the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate should apply, the

13 NEW SECTION. Section 6. Rulemaking authority. The department shall adopt rules that are
14 necessary to implement and administer [sections 1 through 7 6].
15
16 NEW SECTION. SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS AND FIXED MILL
17 LEVY LIMITS SUPERSEDED. (1) (A) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SET MILL LEVIES THAT
18 ADJUST DOWNWARD WHEN TAXABLE VALUE INCREASES UNDER 15-10-420. THIS FLOATING MILL LEVY CONCEPT
19 AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE,
20 WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE OCCURS
21 WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR TAXPAYERS THAT
22 ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
23 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
24 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO
25 RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THE POWER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 5, OF THE MONTANA
26 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.
27 (2) AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO SUPERSEDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS

Committee of the Whole
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Jaret Coles, HB0231.004.007
1 THAT FIX MILL LEVY LIMITS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF EXERCISING THE POWER TO TAX WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING
2 LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCES WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS. HAVING CONSIDERED
3 ALL OPTIONS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THE STATUTORY STRUCTURE OF THE PROPERTY TAX HAS
4 EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF INITIATIVE MEASURE NO. 105 ON NOVEMBER 4, 1986, AND THE
5 ENACTMENT OF 15-10-420 BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 1999. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
6 PROPERTY TAX AND THE RISING COST OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, THERE IS A COMPELLING
7 INTEREST TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE TO LOWER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAX RATES FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCES,
8 WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS SECTION AND 15-10-420.
9 (3) AFTER [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION], A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A
10 SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED, EITHER BY CHARTER OR BY VOTER APPROVAL MAY:
11 (A) ELECT TO TRANSITION A VOTED MILL LEVY TO A DOLLAR-BASED MILL LEVY EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF
12 PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025 AND THEREAFTER SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF 15-10-420(1)(A);
13 OR
14 (B) LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2026 THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
15 TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL LEVY THE
16 NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.
17 (4) This section does not apply to a charter mill levy that is provided for pursuant to 15-6-134.
18
19 NEW SECTION. SECTION 8. REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOSS OF REVENUE FROM CERTAIN FIXED MILL LEVIES.
20 (1) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL REIMBURSE EACH TAXING ENTITY AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION FOR THE REVENUE LOSS
21 RESULTING FROM THE TAX RATE REDUCTIONS IN 15-6-134 AS AMENDED BY [THIS ACT] FOR THE FOLLOWING LEVIES:
22 (A) LEVIES OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A CHARTER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT INCLUDES A MILL
23 LEVY LIMIT OF A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE CHARTER; AND
24 (B) LEVIES STATED AS A SPECIFIC MILL LEVY AUTHORIZED BY VOTERS BEFORE [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
25 THIS SECTION passage and approval of this act].
26 (2) FOR FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
27 PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1) AND THE PROPERTY TAX

2 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1)
3 AND THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE THAT WOULD BE COLLECTED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR USING THE MILL LEVY THAT
4 WOULD RAISE THE FISCAL YEAR 2025 TAX REVENUE USING THE FISCAL YEAR 2026 TAXABLE VALUE.
5 (3) A REIMBURSEMENT PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SECTION MAY ONLY BE MADE FOR 4 YEARS AFTER [THE
6 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION].
7 (4) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL DISTRIBUTE THE REIMBURSEMENTS WITH THE ENTITLEMENT SHARE
8 PAYMENTS UNDER 15-1-121(7).

10 NEW SECTION. SECTION 9. DEFINITIONS. AS USED IN [SECTIONS 9 THROUGH 11], THE FOLLOWING
11 DEFINITIONS APPLY:

15 LAND, NOT EXCEEDING 1 ACRE, AS IS REASONABLY NECESSARY FOR ITS USE AS A DWELLING AND THAT WERE ASSESSED
16 AND PAID BY THE TAXPAYER FOR TAX YEAR 2024. THE AMOUNT OF MONTANA PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED AND PAID IS

18 PROPERTY TAX BILL RECEIVED BY THE TAXPAYER WITH A FIRST-HALF PAYMENT DUE IN OR AROUND NOVEMBER 2024 AND
19 A SECOND-HALF PAYMENT DUE IN OR AROUND MAY 2025.

19 AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE,
20 WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE OCCURS
21 WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR TAXPAYERS THAT
22 ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
23 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
24 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO
25 RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THE POWER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 5, OF THE MONTANA
26 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.
27 (2) AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO SUPERSEDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS

1 THAT FIX MILL LEVY LIMITS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF EXERCISING THE POWER TO TAX WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING
2 LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCES WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS. HAVING CONSIDERED
3 ALL OPTIONS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THE STATUTORY STRUCTURE OF THE PROPERTY TAX HAS
4 EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF INITIATIVE MEASURE NO. 105 ON NOVEMBER 4, 1986, AND THE
5 ENACTMENT OF 15-10-420 BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 1999. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
6 PROPERTY TAX AND THE RISING COST OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, THERE IS A COMPELLING
7 INTEREST TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE TO LOWER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAX RATES FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCES,
8 WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS SECTION AND 15-10-420.
9 (3) AFTER [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION], A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A
10 SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED, EITHER BY CHARTER OR BY VOTER APPROVAL MAY:
11 (A) ELECT TO TRANSITION A VOTED MILL LEVY TO A DOLLAR-BASED MILL LEVY EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF
12 PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025 AND THEREAFTER SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF 15-10-420(1)(A);
13 OR
14 (B) LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2026 THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
15 TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL LEVY THE
16 NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.
17 (4) This section does not apply to a charter mill levy that is provided for pursuant to 15-6-134.

19 NEW SECTION. SECTION 8. REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOSS OF REVENUE FROM CERTAIN FIXED MILL LEVIES.
20 (1) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL REIMBURSE EACH TAXING ENTITY AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION FOR THE REVENUE LOSS
21 RESULTING FROM THE TAX RATE REDUCTIONS IN 15-6-134 AS AMENDED BY [THIS ACT] FOR THE FOLLOWING LEVIES:
22 (A) LEVIES OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A CHARTER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT INCLUDES A MILL
23 LEVY LIMIT OF A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE CHARTER; AND
24 (B) LEVIES STATED AS A SPECIFIC MILL LEVY AUTHORIZED BY VOTERS BEFORE [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
25 THIS SECTION passage and approval of this act].
26 (2) FOR FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
27 PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1) AND THE PROPERTY TAX
