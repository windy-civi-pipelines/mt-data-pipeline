1 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead

17 ADJUST DOWNWARD WHEN TAXABLE VALUE INCREASES UNDER 15-10-420. THIS FLOATING MILL LEVY CONCEPT
18 AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE,
19 WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE OCCURS
20 WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR TAXPAYERS THAT
21 ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
22 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
23 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO
24 RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THE POWER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 5, OF THE MONTANA
25 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.
26 (2) AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO SUPERSEDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS
27 THAT FIX MILL LEVY LIMITS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF EXERCISING THE POWER TO TAX WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING

5 PROPERTY TAX AND THE RISING COST OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, THERE IS A COMPELLING

7 WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS SECTION AND 15-10-420.
8 (3) AFTER [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION], A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A

11 PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025 AND THEREAFTER SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF 15-10-420(1)(A);
12 OR
13 (B) LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2026 THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
14 TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL LEVY THE
15 NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.

19 RESULTING FROM THE TAX RATE REDUCTIONS IN 15-6-134 AS AMENDED BY [THIS ACT] FOR THE FOLLOWING LEVIES:
20 (A) LEVIES OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A CHARTER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT INCLUDES A MILL
21 LEVY LIMIT OF A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE CHARTER; AND
22 (B) LEVIES STATED AS A SPECIFIC MILL LEVY AUTHORIZED BY VOTERS BEFORE [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
23 THIS SECTION passage and approval of this act].
24 (2) FOR FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
25 PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1) AND THE PROPERTY TAX
26 REVENUE COLLECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025 2024. AFTER FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO

4 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION].
5 (4) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in
6 revenue from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] to the department of revenue.

13 SECTION 11. SECTION 15-1-121, MCA, IS AMENDED TO READ:
14 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
15 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
16 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
17 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
18 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
19 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
20 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
21 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
22 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
23 sending a portion to other local governments.
24 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
25 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
26 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),
27 Chapter 584, Laws of 1999;

10 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
11 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
12 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
13 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
14 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
15 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
16 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
17 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
18 year.
19 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
20 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
21 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
22 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
23 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
24 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
25 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
26 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
27 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as

1 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
2 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
3 multiplied by 0.25.
4 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
5 the lesser of:
6 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
7 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
8 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
9 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
10 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
11 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
12 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
13 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
14 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
15 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
16 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
17 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
18 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
19 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
20 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
21 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
22 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
23 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
24 2002.
25 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
26 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
27 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-

1 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
2 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
3 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
4 be calculated separately for:
5 (A) counties;
6 (B) consolidated local governments; and
7 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
8 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
9 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
10 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
11 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
12 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
13 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
14 United States bureau of the census.
15 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
16 follows:
17 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
18 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
19 and
20 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
21 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
22 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
23 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
24 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
25 follows:
26 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
27 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and

1 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
2 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
3 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
4 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
5 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
6 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
7 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
8 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
9 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
10 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
11 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
12 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
13 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
14 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
15 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
16 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
17 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
18 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
19 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
20 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
21 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
22 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
23 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
24 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 8 7].
25 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
26 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
27 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in

1 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
2 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
3 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
4 financing districts is as follows:

Flathead Kalispell - District 3 37,231
Flathead Whitefish District 148,194
Gallatin Bozeman - downtown 31,158
Missoula Missoula - 1-1C 225,251
Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
5 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
6 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
7 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
8 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
9 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
10 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
11 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
12 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
13 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
14 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
15 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
16 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
17 (i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and
18 (ii) fails to remit any amounts collected on behalf of the state as required by 15-1-504 or as
