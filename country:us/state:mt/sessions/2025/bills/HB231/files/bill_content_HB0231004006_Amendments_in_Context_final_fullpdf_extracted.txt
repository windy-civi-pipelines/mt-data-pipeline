1 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead

14
15 NEW SECTION. SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS AND FIXED MILL
16 LEVY LIMITS SUPERSEDED. (1) (A) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SET MILL LEVIES THAT
17 ADJUST DOWNWARD WHEN TAXABLE VALUE INCREASES UNDER 15-10-420. THIS FLOATING MILL LEVY CONCEPT
18 AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE,
19 WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE OCCURS
20 WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR TAXPAYERS THAT
21 ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
22 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
23 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO
24 RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THE POWER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 5, OF THE MONTANA
25 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.
26 (2) AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO SUPERSEDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS
27 THAT FIX MILL LEVY LIMITS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF EXERCISING THE POWER TO TAX WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING

1 LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCES WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS. HAVING CONSIDERED
2 ALL OPTIONS ON A STATEWIDE BASIS, THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THE STATUTORY STRUCTURE OF THE PROPERTY TAX HAS
3 EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF INITIATIVE MEASURE NO. 105 ON NOVEMBER 4, 1986, AND THE
4 ENACTMENT OF 15-10-420 BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 1999. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
5 PROPERTY TAX AND THE RISING COST OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, THERE IS A COMPELLING

7 WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS SECTION AND 15-10-420.
8 (3) AFTER [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION], A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A

11 PROPERTY TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025 AND THEREAFTER SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF 15-10-420(1)(A);
12 OR
13 (B) LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2026 THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
14 TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL LEVY THE
15 NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.
16

18 (1) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL REIMBURSE EACH TAXING ENTITY AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION FOR THE REVENUE LOSS
19 RESULTING FROM THE TAX RATE REDUCTIONS IN 15-6-134 AS AMENDED BY [THIS ACT] FOR THE FOLLOWING LEVIES:
20 (A) LEVIES OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A CHARTER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT INCLUDES A MILL
21 LEVY LIMIT OF A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE CHARTER; AND
22 (B) LEVIES STATED AS A SPECIFIC MILL LEVY AUTHORIZED BY VOTERS BEFORE [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF
23 THIS SECTION].
24 (2) (a) FOR FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
25 PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1) AND THE PROPERTY TAX
26 REVENUE COLLECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. AFTER FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE
27 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1)

2 WOULD RAISE THE FISCAL YEAR 2025 TAX REVENUE USING THE FISCAL YEAR 2026 TAXABLE VALUE.
3 (b) A reimbursement pursuant to this section must include any fines, penalties, or damages
4 resulting from a judgment levy against the taxing entity in levying property taxes in accordance with [section 7].
5 (3) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in
6 revenue from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] and any amount reimbursable under
7 subsection (2)(b) to the department of revenue.
8 (3)(4) A REIMBURSEMENT PROVIDED FOR IN THIS SECTION MAY ONLY BE MADE FOR 4 YEARS AFTER [THE
9 EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION].
10 (4)(5) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL DISTRIBUTE THE REIMBURSEMENTS WITH THE ENTITLEMENT SHARE
11 PAYMENTS UNDER 15-1-121(7).

17 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
18 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
19 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
20 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
21 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
22 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
23 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
24 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
25 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
26 sending a portion to other local governments.

11 (o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
12 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
13 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
14 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
15 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
16 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
17 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
18 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
19 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
20 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
21 year.
22 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
23 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
24 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
25 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
26 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
27 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in

1 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
2 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
3 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
4 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
5 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
6 multiplied by 0.25.
7 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
8 the lesser of:
9 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
10 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
11 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
12 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
13 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
14 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
15 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
16 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
17 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
18 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
19 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
20 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
21 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
22 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
23 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
24 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
25 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
26 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
27 2002.

1 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
2 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
3 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
4 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
5 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
6 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
7 be calculated separately for:
8 (A) counties;
9 (B) consolidated local governments; and
10 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
11 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
12 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
13 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
14 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
15 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
16 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
17 United States bureau of the census.
18 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
19 follows:
20 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
21 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
22 and
23 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
24 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
25 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
26 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
27 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as

1 follows:
2 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
3 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
4 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
5 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
6 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
7 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
8 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
9 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
10 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
11 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
12 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
13 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
14 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
15 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
16 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
17 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
18 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
19 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
20 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
21 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
22 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
23 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
24 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
25 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
26 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
27 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 8].

2 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
3 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in

11 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
12 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
13 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
14 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
15 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
16 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
17 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be

5 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
6 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
7 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
8 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
9 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
10 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
11 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
12 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
13 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
14 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
15 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
16 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:

16 department determines that an application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax
17 rate was improperly approved OR THAT THE PROPERTY NO LONGER QUALIFIES FOR THE REDUCED RATE, the
18 department shall revise the assessment for each year the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property
19 reduced tax rate was improperly granted subject to the assessment revision procedure established in 15-8-601.
20 (2) (a) A person who files a false or fraudulent application for a homestead reduced tax rate

1 (b) The base penalty amount is equal to the property tax due for each year the homestead
2 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate was improperly received, determined using the tax rate
3 provided for in 15-6-134(3)(a), the appraised value, and the mill levies in effect for the year, less the actual
4 property taxes paid in the year.
5 (c) The revised assessment and penalty must be assessed against a person who filed a false or
6 fraudulent application even if the person no longer owns the property.
7 (4) If the person who filed a false or fraudulent application no longer owns the property associated
8 with the false or fraudulent application, the penalty plus interest provided for in subsection (3) may be recovered
9 as any other tax owed the state. If the penalty plus interest becomes due and owing, the department may issue
10 a warrant for distraint as provided in Title 15, chapter 1, part 7.
11 (5) Except as provided in subsection (4), if the department determines that a false or fraudulent
12 application was made, the department shall send the revised assessment with the additional penalty amount as

1 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
2 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
3 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
4 (2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review
5 provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board
6 and then to the Montana tax appeal board, whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts.
7 An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
8 the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
9 determines that the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate should apply, the

15 NEW SECTION. SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS AND FIXED MILL
16 LEVY LIMITS SUPERSEDED. (1) (A) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SET MILL LEVIES THAT
17 ADJUST DOWNWARD WHEN TAXABLE VALUE INCREASES UNDER 15-10-420. THIS FLOATING MILL LEVY CONCEPT
18 AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE,
19 WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE OCCURS
20 WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR TAXPAYERS THAT
21 ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
22 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
23 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO
24 RECOGNIZES AND RESPECTS THE POWER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDER ARTICLE XI, SECTION 5, OF THE MONTANA
25 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.
26 (2) AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE LEGISLATURE INTENDS TO SUPERSEDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS

20 (A) LEVIES OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A CHARTER FORM OF GOVERNMENT THAT INCLUDES A MILL
21 LEVY LIMIT OF A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF MILLS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE CHARTER; AND
22 (B) LEVIES STATED AS A SPECIFIC MILL LEVY AUTHORIZED BY VOTERS BEFORE [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF

24 (2) (a) FOR FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
25 PROPERTY TAX REVENUE COLLECTED FROM THE LEVIES PROVIDED FOR IN SUBSECTION (1) AND THE PROPERTY TAX
26 REVENUE COLLECTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. AFTER FISCAL YEAR 2026, THE REIMBURSEMENT MUST BE EQUAL TO THE

4 resulting from a judgment levy against the taxing entity in levying property taxes in accordance with [section 7].
5 (3) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in
6 revenue from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] and any amount reimbursable under

18 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
19 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
20 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
21 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
22 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
23 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
24 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
25 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases

13 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
14 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
15 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
16 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
17 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.

21 year.
22 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
23 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
24 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
25 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
26 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
27 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in

1 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
2 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
3 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
4 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
5 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
6 multiplied by 0.25.
7 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
8 the lesser of:
9 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
10 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
11 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
12 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
13 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
14 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
15 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
16 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
17 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
18 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
19 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
20 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
21 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
22 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
23 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
24 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
25 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
26 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
27 2002.

8 (A) counties;
9 (B) consolidated local governments; and
10 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
11 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
12 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
13 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
14 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
15 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
16 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
17 United States bureau of the census.
18 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
19 follows:
20 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
21 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
22 and
23 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
24 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated

2 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
3 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
4 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or

6 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
7 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
8 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
9 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
10 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
11 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
12 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
13 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
14 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
15 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
16 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
17 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
18 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
19 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
20 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
21 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
22 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
23 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
24 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
25 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
26 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
27 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 8].

6 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
7 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
8 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
9 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
10 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
