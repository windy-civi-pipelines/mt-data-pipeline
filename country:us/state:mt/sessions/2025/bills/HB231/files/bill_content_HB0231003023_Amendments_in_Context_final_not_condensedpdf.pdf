15 grant an application for the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate. Extenuating
16 circumstances include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are material in
17 nature and of a character different from the typical or customary, and that are not expected to recur.
18 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
19 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or

26 determines that the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate should apply, the
27 department shall adjust the taxable value of the property in accordance with the board's order.

1 NEW SECTION. Section 6. Rulemaking authority. The department shall adopt rules that are
2 necessary to implement and administer [sections 1 through 76].
3
4 NEW SECTION. Section 7. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
5 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
6 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
7 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
8 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
9 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
10 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
11 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
12 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
13 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
14 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
15 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
16 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
17 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
18 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
19 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
20 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
21 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
22 (3) After [the effective date of this section], a local government with a mill levy limit of a specific
23 number of mills that may be imposed, either by charter or by voter approval may:
24 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
25 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
26 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
27 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
28 levied in fiscal year 2026.

2 NEW SECTION. Section 8. Reimbursement for loss of revenue from certain fixed mill levies. (1)
3 The department shall reimburse each taxing entity as provided in this section for the revenue loss resulting from
4 the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] for the following levies:
5 (a) levies of a local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a
6 specific number of mills that may be imposed in the charter; and
7 (b) levies stated as a specific mill levy authorized by voters before [the effective date of this
8 section].
9 (2) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the property
10 tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue collected in
11 fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
12 property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue that
13 would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax revenue
14 using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
15 (3) A reimbursement provided for in this section may only be made for 4 years after [the effective
16 date of this section].
17 (4) The department shall distribute the reimbursements with the entitlement share payments under
18 15-1-121(7).
19
20 NEW SECTION. Section 9. Definitions. As used in [sections 9 through 11], the following definitions
21 apply:
22 (1) "Montana property taxes" means the ad valorem property taxes, special assessments, and
23 other fees imposed on property classified under 15-6-134 that is a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a multiple-
24 unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home, or mobile home and as much of the surrounding land, not exceeding
25 1 acre, as is reasonably necessary for its use as a dwelling and that were assessed and paid by the taxpayer
26 for tax year 2024. The amount of Montana property taxes assessed and paid is equal to the total amount billed
27 by the local government for the dwelling as shown on the 2024 property tax bill received by the taxpayer with a
28 first-half payment due in or around November 2024 and a second-half payment due in or around May 2025.

1 (2) "Owned" includes purchasing under a contract for deed and being the grantor or grantors under
2 a revocable trust indenture.
3 (3) (a) "Principal residence" means, subject to the provisions of subsection (3)(b), a dwelling:
4 (i) in which an owner can demonstrate the owner owned and lived for at least 7 months of the
5 year for which the property tax rebate is claimed;
6 (ii) that is the only residence for which the taxpayer claims the property tax rebate; and
7 (iii) for which the taxpayer made payment of the assessed Montana property taxes during tax year
8 2024.
9 (b) A taxpayer who cannot meet the requirements of subsection (3)(a)(i) because the owner’s
10 principal residence changed during the tax year to another principal residence may still claim the property tax
11 rebate if the taxpayer paid the Montana property taxes while residing in each principal residence for a total of at
12 least 7 consecutive months for the 2024 tax year.
13 (4) "Tax year 2024" means the period January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.
14
15 NEW SECTION. Section 10. Property tax rebate -- manner of claiming -- limitations -- appeals.
16 (1) Subject to the conditions provided for in [sections 9 through 11], there is a rebate of Montana property taxes
17 in the amount of $400 or the amount of total property taxes paid, whichever is less, for tax year 2024.
18 (2) The rebate provided for in subsection (1) is for Montana property taxes assessed to and paid
19 by a taxpayer or taxpayers on property they owned and occupied as a principal residence during tax year 2024.
20 (3) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by June 30, 2025, for tax year 2024.
21 Receipt of a notice does not establish that a taxpayer or property owner is eligible for a rebate, and a taxpayer
22 who does not receive a notice may still be eligible to claim a rebate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of
23 notice, shall claim a rebate as provided in subsection (5).
24 (4) Except as provided in subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a
25 multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home, or mobile home and as much of the surrounding land, not
26 exceeding 1 acre that is owned by an entity is not eligible to claim the rebate.
27 (5) (a) (i) All claims for this property tax rebate must be submitted to the department electronically
28 or by mail.

2 NEW SECTION. Section 11. Property tax rebate -- penalty for false or fraudulent claim. (1)
3 Except as provided in subsection (2), if the department discovers that a rebate paid to a taxpayer exceeded the
4 amount allowed by [sections 9 through 11], the department may, within 1 year from the date the rebate was
5 transmitted to the taxpayer, assess the taxpayer for the difference. The assessment is subject to the uniform
6 dispute review procedure established in 15-1-211.
7 (2) A person who files a false or fraudulent claim for a property tax rebate under [sections 9
8 through 11] is subject to criminal prosecution under the provisions of 45-7-202. If a false or fraudulent claim has
9 been paid by the department, the amount paid may be recovered as any other tax owed the state, together with
10 a penalty of 300% of the rebate claimed and interest on the amount of the rebate claimed plus penalty at the
11 rate of 12% a year, until paid. If this rebate plus penalty becomes due and owing, the department may issue a

14 Section 12. Section 15-1-121, MCA, is amended to read:
15 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
16 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
17 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
18 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
19 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
20 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
21 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
22 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
23 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
24 sending a portion to other local governments.
25 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
26 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
27 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),

7 (o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
8 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
9 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
10 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
11 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
12 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
13 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
14 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
15 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
16 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
17 year.
18 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
19 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
20 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
21 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
22 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
23 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
24 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
25 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
26 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
27 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
28 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources

1 multiplied by 0.25.
2 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
3 the lesser of:
4 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
5 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
6 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
7 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
8 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
9 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
10 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
11 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
12 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
13 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
14 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
15 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
16 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
17 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
18 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
19 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
20 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
21 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
22 2002.
23 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
24 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
25 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
26 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
27 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
28 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must

1 be calculated separately for:
2 (A) counties;
3 (B) consolidated local governments; and
4 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
5 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
6 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
7 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
8 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
9 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
10 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
11 United States bureau of the census.
12 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
13 follows:
14 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
15 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
16 and
17 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
18 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
19 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
20 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
21 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
22 follows:
23 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
24 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
25 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
26 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
27 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
28 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.

1 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
2 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
3 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
4 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
5 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
6 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
7 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
8 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
9 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
10 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
11 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
12 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
13 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
14 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
15 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
16 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
17 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
18 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
19 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
20 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 8].
21 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
22 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
23 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
24 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
25 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
26 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
27 financing districts is as follows:

1 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
2 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
3 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
4 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
5 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
6 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
7 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
8 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
9 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
10 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
11 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
12 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
13 (i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and

15 otherwise required by law within 45 days of the end of a month.
16 (c) A payment required pursuant to this section may be withheld if, for more than 90 days, a local

16 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
17 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
18 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a

1 electronic form:
2 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
3 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
4 market model area; and
5 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the

7 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
8 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
9 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
10 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
11 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
12 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
13 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
14 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
15 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the

18 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
19 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
20 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
21 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
22 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
23 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
24 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
25 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
26 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
27 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
28 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:

2 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
3 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
4 for making the adjustment.
5 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
6 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
7 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
8 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
9 office hours.
10 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
11 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
12 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
13 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
14 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
15 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
16 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
17 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
18 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
19 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
20 accordance with the board's order."
