22 following definitions apply:
23 (1) "Homestead reduced tax rate" means the tax rate provided for in 15-6-134(3)(b)(i).
24 (2) "Long-term rental" means class four residential property:
25 (a) that is a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home,

5 necessary to implement and administer [sections 1 through 7 6].
6
7 NEW SECTION. SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHARTERS AND FIXED MILL
8 LEVY LIMITS SUPERSEDED -- definition. (1) (A) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SET MILL
9 LEVIES THAT ADJUST DOWNWARD WHEN TAXABLE VALUE INCREASES UNDER 15-10-420. THIS FLOATING MILL LEVY
10 CONCEPT AUTOMATICALLY LOWERS THE NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED AGAINST A TAXPAYER WHEN PROPERTY VALUES
11 INCREASE, WHICH MITIGATES INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. HOWEVER, WHEN MILL LEVIES ARE FIXED, THE OPPOSITE
12 OCCURS WHEN PROPERTY VALUES INCREASE, AND PROPERTY TAXES ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY MITIGATED FOR
13 TAXPAYERS THAT ARE LEVIED BASED ON A FIXED MILL LEVY.
14 (B) THE LEGISLATURE FINDS FURTHER THAT IT IS PROHIBITED UNDER ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 2, OF THE
15 MONTANA CONSTITUTION, FROM SUSPENDING OR CONTRACTING AWAY THE POWER TO TAX. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO

17 CONSTITUTION TO ADOPT, AMEND, REVISE, OR ABANDON A CHARTER.

19 THAT FIX MILL LEVY LIMITS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE OF EXERCISING THE POWER TO TAX WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING
20 LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE SOURCES WITHOUT RAISING TAXES ON RESIDENTIAL TAXPAYERS. HAVING CONSIDERED

23 ENACTMENT OF 15-10-420 BY THE LEGISLATURE IN 1999. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE
24 PROPERTY TAX AND THE RISING COST OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, THERE IS A COMPELLING
25 INTEREST TO ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE TO LOWER RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY TAX RATES FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCES,
26 WHICH CAN ONLY BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THIS SECTION AND 15-10-420.
27 (3) AFTER [THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS SECTION], A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH A MILL LEVY LIMIT OF A

11 (B) LEVY THE NUMBER OF MILLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2026 THAT WILL GENERATE THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY
12 TAXES ASSESSED IN FISCAL YEAR 2025. IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER 2026, THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SHALL LEVY THE
13 NUMBER OF MILLS LEVIED IN FISCAL YEAR 2026.
14 (5) As used in this section, "public safety" means police, fire, and emergency medical services.
