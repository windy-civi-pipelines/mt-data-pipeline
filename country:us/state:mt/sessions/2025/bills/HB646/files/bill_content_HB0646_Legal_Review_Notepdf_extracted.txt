CONFORMITY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS
As required pursuant to section 5-11-112(1)(c), MCA, it is the Legislative Services Division's
statutory responsibility to conduct "legal review of draft bills". The comments noted below
regarding conformity with state and federal constitutions are provided to assist the Legislature
in making its own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill. The comments are based
on an analysis of jurisdictionally relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the
bill. The comments are not written for the purpose of influencing whether the bill should
become law but are written to provide information relevant to the Legislature's consideration
of this bill. The comments are not a formal legal opinion and are not a substitute for the
judgment of the judiciary, which has the authority to determine the constitutionality of a law
in the context of a specific case.
This review is intended to inform the bill draft requestor of potential constitutional conformity
issues that may be raised by the bill as drafted. This review IS NOT dispositive of the issue of
constitutional conformity and the general rule as repeatedly stated by the Montana Supreme
Court is that an enactment of the Legislature is presumed to be constitutional unless it is
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the enactment is unconstitutional. See Alexander v.
Bozeman Motors, Inc., 356 Mont. 439, 234 P.3d 880 (2010); Eklund v. Wheatland County,
351 Mont. 370, 212 P.3d 297 (2009); St. v. Pyette, 337 Mont. 265, 159 P.3d 232 (2007); and
Elliott v. Dept. of Revenue, 334 Mont. 195, 146 P.3d 741 (2006).
Legal Reviewer Comments:
Article VII, section 8, of the Montana Constitution provides: "(1) Supreme court justices and
district court judges shall be elected by the qualified electors as provided by law. . . ."
Article VII, section 9, of the Montana Constitution provides:
(1) A citizen of the United States who has resided in the state two years immediately
before taking office is eligible to the office of supreme court justice or district court judge
if admitted to the practice of law in Montana for at least five years prior to the date of
appointment or election. Qualifications and methods of selection of judges of other courts
shall be provided by law. . . . (4) Supreme court justices shall reside within the state.
During his term of office, a district court judge shall reside in the district and a justice of
the peace shall reside in the county in which he is elected or appointed. The residency
requirement for every other judge must be provided by law.
HB 646, as drafted, amends 3-2-101 to provide that justices of the Supreme Court "are each
elected in a separate district by the qualified electors in that district at the election next preceding
the expiration of the term of office of the justice's predecessor."

Section 2:
Section 2 of HB 646 provides for the makeup of the seven districts and requires the Legislature
to review the districts after the decennial census to maintain districts "with approximately equal
populations while following county lines."
In 2011, the Legislature referred LR 119 to the voters to change the law to elect each Supreme
Court justice from one of seven districts of approximately equal population and provided a
residency and voter-registration requirement.
HB 646, unlike LR 119, does not include a residency requirement with the district from which
each justice is elected. In the case of LR 119, the referendum was challenged. In the court case
that ensued, the Supreme Court discussed the structure and requirements of the Constitution,
concluding that "[t]he language and structure of these sections demonstrate that the Constitution
intends Supreme Court justices to be elected and serve on a statewide basis. . . ." Reichert v.
State, 2012 MT 111, ¶ 64. The Supreme Court noted that the Constitution explicitly states:
[w]hen a justice or judge is to be selected from a discrete geographic area. . . . With
respect to Supreme Court justices, however, the Constitution could, but does not,
specify district elections. To the contrary, the residency requirements in Section
9(4) plainly contemplate that Supreme Court justice, district court judge, and
justice of the peace are "state," "district," and "county" offices, respectively.
Id. at ¶ 64. The Court found that the Supreme Court was not intended to be a representative
body, and it would be "incongruous to interpret the Constitution as contemplating a Supreme
Court made up of justices who are elected from districts and [who] implicitly 'represent' regional
interests." Id. at ¶ 65.
Finally, the Supreme Court explicitly held that Article VII, section 8(1), did not confer authority
to convert the Supreme Court into a "district-based representative body." Id. at ¶ 75. The
Supreme Court traced the adoption, history, and discussions concerning Article VII, and it held
that such a change was facially unconstitutional and impermissible absent constitutional
amendment. Id. at ¶¶ 75-82.
In 2021, the Legislature passed HB 325, a legislative referendum similar to LR 119, except that
it did not require a justice to reside in a particular district to be elected for that district. HB 325
was challenged as unconstitutional in McDonald v. Jacobsen, 2022 MT 160. In McDonald, the
Supreme Court dismissed the lack of a residency requirement as distinguishing the application of
Reichert, noting that the “2012 Reichert precedent is squarely on-point.” McDonald, 2022 MT at
¶ 29. The Supreme Court conducted a lengthy analysis of Reichert and its application to HB 325
and ruled that the bill was unconstitutional and “was contrary to the spirit of protecting the right
of all Montanans to vote [and would] deny each Montana their right to vote in the election of sic
out of the seven justices on their Supreme Court.” Id. at ¶ 54.
Because HB 646, as drafted, presents issues that were held unconstitutional in LR 119 and in HB
325, it may, likewise, present constitutional conformity issues by proposing amendments to the
structure of the Supreme Court through statutory changes rather than constitutional amendments.
