4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT GENERALLY REQUIRING THAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES
5 BE ELECTED AND APPOINTED FROM DISTRICTS; ESTABLISHING SUPREME COURT DISTRICTS;
6 PROVIDING A TRANSITION; AMENDING SECTIONS 3-2-101 AND 13-14-211, MCA; PROVIDING AN
7 APPLICABILITY DATE.”
8
9 WHEREAS, Article VII, section 8(1), of the Montana Constitution provides that "Supreme court justices
10 and district court judges shall be elected by the qualified electors as provided by law"; and
11 WHEREAS, Article IV, section 4, of the Montana Constitution explicitly grants the legislature power to
12 prescribe "additional qualifications" for "any public office"; and
13 WHEREAS, the current method of electing all state supreme court justices at large has not proved
14 satisfactory in Montana, which differs from most other states in that there is no district-based intermediate
15 appellate court and the population is scattered over a very large area; and
16 WHEREAS, electing supreme court justices by district would increase the likelihood that voters are
17 familiar with candidates for the court; and
18 WHEREAS, states and territories of the United States--including the former Montana Territory--have a
19 long history, dating from the colonial era to the present day, of prescribing that justices of their highest courts
20 are selected in, or otherwise connected with, specific districts; and
21 WHEREAS, the long history of selecting state supreme court justices by district has not resulted in any
22 reported deterioration of the judicial function, and may improve it by bringing to the court more knowledge of
23 local circumstances; and
24 WHEREAS, several other states continue to elect justices of their highest courts by district, including
25 but not limited to, Kentucky, Oregon, and our neighboring state of South Dakota, also without any reported
26 deterioration of the judicial function; and
27 WHEREAS, two previous legislatures have endorsed electing Montana supreme court justices by
28 district; and

69th Legislature 2025 LC 2937
1 WHEREAS, the decisions of the Montana Supreme Court invalidating those measures were based on
2 clear errors of fact and law, including a lack of awareness of Article IV, section 4, of the Montana Constitution
3 and a lack of awareness of America's long history of choosing justices of courts of last resort by district.
