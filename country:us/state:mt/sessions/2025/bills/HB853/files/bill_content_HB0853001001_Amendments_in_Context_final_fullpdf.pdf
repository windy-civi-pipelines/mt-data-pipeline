13 (2) A person operating an establishment who fails to renew a license by the expiration date
14 provided in 50-57-206 and who operates the establishment in the license year for which an annual renewal fee
15 was not paid shall, upon renewal, pay to the department a late renewal fee of $25 in addition to the annual
16 renewal fee required by subsection (1). Payment of the late renewal fee does not relieve the operator of
17 responsibility for operating without a license.
18 (3) The department shall deposit the annual fees collected under subsection (1) as follows:
19 (a) 90% into the state special revenue fund to the credit of the local board inspection fund account,
20 created in 50-2-108;
21 (b) 5% into the general fund; and
22 (c) 5% into the account created in 50-57-213 in the state special revenue fund.
23 (4) The department shall deposit all of the fees collected under subsection (2) into the account
24 created by 50-57-213 in the state special revenue fund."
