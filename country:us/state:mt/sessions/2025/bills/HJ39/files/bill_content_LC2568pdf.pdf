11 and
12 WHEREAS, Montanans' affection for public lands extends to protected areas from the Going-to-the-
13 Sun Road in Glacier National Park to the Capitol Rock Natural Landmark in the Custer Gallatin National Forest
14 and all of the acres of public lands in between managed by federal agencies that feature iconic working
15 ranches, mountain bike trail systems, world-class climbing, outstanding whitewater rafting, historical centers,
16 museums, and incredible hunting and angling opportunities; and
17 WHEREAS, our public lands reflect many of our most noble democratic ideals because public lands
18 offer valuable recreational, economic, cultural, and spiritual opportunities for everyone, regardless of one's

1 Montana, 95% of Montanans visited national public lands in the previous year, 83% believe national public
2 lands help the state economy, and 82% want presidents to continue protecting national public lands by
3 designating them as national monuments; and
4 WHEREAS, our shared public lands have a substantial impact on economic development and jobs
5 through mineral extraction, timber sales, ranching, grazing, and the outdoor recreation and tourism industry,
6 which alone accounted for over $5.8 billion dollars spent in the state in 2022 and 2023 by nonresidents; and
7 WHEREAS, misguided attempts to seize control of vast acreage of national public lands from the
8 American public and to force their disposal through litigation and legislation, supported by a multimillion-dollar

10 WHEREAS, public land managers, federal funding, and federal staffing are integral to the protection of
11 public lands so they may be enjoyed by Montanans.
