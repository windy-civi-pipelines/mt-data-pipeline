12 statewide advisory group. (1) The department shall monitor state waters to assess the quality of those waters
13 and to identify surface water bodies or segments of surface water bodies that are threatened or impaired. The
14 department shall use the monitoring results to revise the list of water bodies that are identified as threatened or
15 impaired and to establish a priority ranking for TMDL development for those waters in accordance with
16 subsections (4) and (7).
17 (2) In revising the list prepared pursuant to this section, the department shall use all currently
18 available data, including information or data obtained from federal, state, and local agencies, private entities, or

21 list, the department shall provide public notice and allow 60 days for public comment on the draft list. The
22 department shall make available for public review, upon request, documentation used in the determination to
23 list or delist a particular water body, including, at a minimum, a description of the information, data, and

5 (4) The department shall, in consultation with local conservation districts and watershed advisory
6 groups pursuant to 75-5-704, review and revise the list and priority rankings of water bodies identified as
7 threatened or impaired. The department shall review and revise the list at intervals not to exceed 5 years. The
8 department shall make available for public review the data and information used in making any changes in its
9 list of threatened or impaired water bodies that is developed and maintained pursuant to this section.
10 (5) By October 1, 1999, and in consultation with the statewide TMDL advisory group established

19 department removes a water body because there is a lack of sufficient credible data to support its listing, the
20 department shall monitor and assess that water body during the next field season or as soon as possible
21 thereafter to determine whether it is a threatened water body or an impaired water body.
22 (7) Except as provided in subsection (9), in prioritizing water bodies for TMDL development, the
23 department shall, in consultation with the statewide TMDL advisory group, take into consideration the following:
24 (a) the beneficial uses established for a water body;

3 noncompliance;
4 (f) whether the water body is an important high-quality resource in an early stage of degradation;
5 (g) the size of the water body not achieving standards;
6 (h) immediate programmatic needs, such as waste load allocations for new permits or permit
7 renewals and load allocations for new nonpoint sources;

15 (8) Except as provided in subsection (9), the department shall, in consultation with the statewide
16 TMDL advisory group, develop a method of rating water bodies according to the criteria and considerations
17 described in subsection (7) in order to rank the listed water bodies as high priority, moderate priority, or low
18 priority for TMDL development. The department may not rank a water body as a high priority under this section
19 without first validating the data necessary to support the ranking.
20 (9) (a) When the department receives an application for a new individual permit to discharge into a

5 with subsection (9)(a)(ii). The department and the applicant shall make reasonable efforts to mutually agree in
6 writing to a timeframe in which the department shall complete development of the TMDL. If the department
7 specifies a lack of resources as a reason why the department cannot complete development of the TMDL in
8 accordance with subsection (9)(a)(ii), the department shall clearly explain in its written specification what
9 resources are not available, why those resources are not available, and when those resources will be available.
10 (c) If the department and the applicant cannot mutually agree to a timeframe in accordance with
