11 WHEREAS, the Montana Water Rights Protection Act (MWRPA), which was ratified by Congress and
12 became federal law on December 27, 2020, contains numerous specific elements that were not negotiated,
13 agreed to, or passed by the Montana Legislature; and
14 WHEREAS, the MWRPA resulted in land exchanges that were never a part of the bill negotiated,
15 agreed to, or passed by the Montana Legislature; and
16 WHEREAS, there has never been a quantification of the volume of water required by the Confederated
17 Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) in the MWRPA to meet the purposes for which the Flathead Indian
18 Reservation was created as required by the Winters doctrine; and
19 WHEREAS, the United States has refused repeatedly to provide the public with a copy of the report
20 entitled “Damages of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes Due to Actions by the United States,"
21 Volume I (March, 2011), Volume II (March, 2011), Volume III (October, 2011), and the final supplement and
22 economic valuation (February, 2016), which is on file at the United States Department of Justice and upon
23 which much of the monetary funds awarded in the MWRPA are based; and
24 WHEREAS, Article IX, section 3(3), of the Montana Constitution states that, “[a]ll surface, underground,

26 people and are subject to appropriation for beneficial uses as provided by law”; and
27 WHEREAS, there are no provisions in the Hellgate Treaty of 1855 that secure for or state that the

1 WHEREAS, much of the Flathead Indian Reservation consists of private landowners and non-tribal
2 members who live within the boundaries of the reservation on land removed from tribal control by the Allotment
3 Acts; and
4 WHEREAS, canons of construction that are favorable to the tribes contradict and conflict with the
5 Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provides that no state shall “deny to any
6 person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”; and
7 WHEREAS, the MWRPA as written assumes that a collective ownership of property and of water by an
8 independent body residing within the state is constitutional, which is repugnant to this republic and to the
9 concept of private property in Montana; and
10 WHEREAS, the MWRPA is fraught with constitutional errors and improprieties, and the MWRPA
11 utilized improper and possibly deceitful means to achieve a final, agreed upon document that was subsequently
12 modified, amended, and altered at the federal level without consultation or input from the Montana Legislature;
13 and
14 WHEREAS, the MWRPA was passed by Congress as an attachment to an omnibus spending bill and
15 was not subject to debate in Congress.
