1 testator's conscious presence and by the testator's direction.
2 (2) If a subsequent will or audiovisual recording does not expressly revoke a previous will, the
3 execution of the subsequent will or audiovisual recording wholly revokes the previous will by inconsistency if the
4 testator intended the subsequent will or audiovisual recording to replace rather than supplement the previous
5 will.
6 (3) The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will or audiovisual recording to
7 replace rather than supplement a previous will or audiovisual recording if the subsequent will or audiovisual
8 recording makes a complete disposition of the testator's estate. If this presumption arises and is not rebutted by
9 clear and convincing evidence, the previous will or audiovisual recording is revoked and only the subsequent
10 will or audiovisual recording is operative on the testator's death.
11 (4) The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will or audiovisual recording to
12 supplement rather than replace a previous will or audiovisual recording if the subsequent will or audiovisual
13 recording does not make a complete disposition of the testator's estate. If this presumption arises and is not
14 rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the subsequent will or audiovisual recording revokes the previous
15 will or audiovisual recording only to the extent the subsequent will or audiovisual recording is inconsistent with
16 the previous will or audiovisual recording and each will or audiovisual recording is fully operative on the
17 testator's death to the extent they are not inconsistent.

11 recording in whole or in part is thereafter revoked by another, later will or an audiovisual recording, the previous
12 will or audiovisual recording remains revoked in whole or in part, unless it or its revoked part is revived. The
