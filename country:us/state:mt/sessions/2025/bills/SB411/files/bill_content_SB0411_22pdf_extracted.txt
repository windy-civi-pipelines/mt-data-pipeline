1 tearing, canceling, obliterating, or destroying the a written will or any part of it. A burning, tearing, or canceling is
2 a revocatory act on the a written will, whether or not the burn, tear, or cancellation touched any of the words on
3 the written will. For the purposes of a written will only, another person may perform the revocatory act in the
4 testator's conscious presence and by the testator's direction.
5 (2) If a subsequent will or audiovisual recording does not expressly revoke a previous will, the
6 execution of the subsequent will or audiovisual recording wholly revokes the previous will by inconsistency if the
7 testator intended the subsequent will or audiovisual recording to replace rather than supplement the previous
8 will.
9 (3) The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will or audiovisual recording to
10 replace rather than supplement a previous will or audiovisual recording if the subsequent will or audiovisual
11 recording makes a complete disposition of the testator's estate. If this presumption arises and is not rebutted by
12 clear and convincing evidence, the previous will or audiovisual recording is revoked and only the subsequent
13 will or audiovisual recording is operative on the testator's death.
14 (4) The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will or audiovisual recording to
15 supplement rather than replace a previous will or audiovisual recording if the subsequent will or audiovisual
16 recording does not make a complete disposition of the testator's estate. If this presumption arises and is not
17 rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the subsequent will or audiovisual recording revokes the previous
18 will or audiovisual recording only to the extent the subsequent will or audiovisual recording is inconsistent with
19 the previous will or audiovisual recording and each will or audiovisual recording is fully operative on the
20 testator's death to the extent they are not inconsistent.

5 revived. The previous will or audiovisual recording is revived if it is evident from the circumstances of the

7 declarations that the testator intended the previous will or audiovisual recording to take effect as executed.
8 (2) If a subsequent will or audiovisual recording that partly revoked a previous will or audiovisual
