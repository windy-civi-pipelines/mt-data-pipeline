25 changes their home state during the course of the investigations. The home state shall also have the authority
26 to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of

21 alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.
22 (10) Nothing in this compact may authorize a member state to demand the issuance of subpoenas
23 for attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another member state for lawful
24 actions within that member state.

27 provided that nothing herein may be construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their
28 own expense; and provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that

19 SECTION 12
20 RULEMAKING
21 (1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules to effectively and efficiently implement and
22 administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule must be invalid and have no force or effect only

24 rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers granted
25 hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
26 (2) The rules of the commission must have the force of law in each member state, provided

- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SB 140
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 140.1
1 court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission must be ineffective in that state to the extent of the

6 (4) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by
7 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within 4 years of the date of
8 adoption of the rule, then such rule must have no further force and effect in any member state.
9 (5) Rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
10 (6) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow
11 persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 140.1
1 received by the commission in response to the proposed rule must be available to the public.
2 (10) Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
3 may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.
4 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule
5 based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
6 (a) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge
7 the original purpose of the proposed rule.

9 the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
10 commenters.
11 (c) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
12 emergency as provided in section 12(12), the effective date of the rule must be no sooner than 30 days after
13 issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
14 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
15 emergency rule within 48 hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking
16 procedures provided in the compact and in this section must be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
17 reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this
18 provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately to:
19 (a) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;

26 revision must be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
27 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made
28 in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – SB 140

1 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
2 without the approval of the commission.

4 SECTION 13
5 OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
6 (1) (a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall
7 enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
8 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or
9 against the commission must be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the
10 principal office of the commission is located. The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to
11 the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein may
12 affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice,
13 misconduct, or any such similar matter.
14 (c) The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
15 enforcement or interpretation of the compact and must have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
16 purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
17 commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
18 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:
19 (a) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
20 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written
21 notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default must describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
22 default, and any other action that the commission may take, and must offer training and specific technical
23 assistance regarding the default.
24 (b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
25 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
26 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
27 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
28 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – SB 140
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 140.1
1 default.
2 (4) Termination of membership in the compact must be imposed only after all other means of
3 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
4 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting
5 state's state licensing authority, and each of the member states' state licensing authority.
6 (5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
7 incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
8 termination.
9 (6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately
10 provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to
11 recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 6 months after the date of said notice
12 of termination.
13 (7) The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that

16 (8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. district
17 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
18 prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
19 (9) (a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related
20 to the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.
21 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
22 resolution for disputes as appropriate.
23 (10) (a) By majority vote as provided by rule, the commission may initiate legal action against a
24 member state in default in the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
25 commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
26 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
27 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
28 reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The
- 24 - Authorized Print Version – SB 140
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 140.1
1 commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
2 (b) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court for the
3 District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
4 with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
5 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of
6 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
7 (c) No person other than a member state may enforce this compact against the commission.
8 SECTION 14
9 EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
10 (1) The compact must come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into
11 law in the seventh member state.
12 (a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the
13 enactment of each of the first seven member states, or charter member states, to determine if the statute
14 enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact statute.
15 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
16 compact statute must be entitled to the default process set forth in section 13.
17 (ii) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the
18 compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact must remain in effect even if the number
19 of member states should be less than seven.
20 (b) Member states enacting the compact after the seven initial charter member states must be
21 subject to the process set forth in section 10(3)(u) to determine if their enactments are materially different from

23 (c) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the
24 administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
25 existence must be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the
26 commission.

9 (c) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately
10 provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory

14 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
15 conflict with the provisions of this compact.
16 (4) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact may
17 become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
18 SECTION 15
19 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
20 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed to
21 effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
22 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's
23 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
24 (2) The provisions of this compact must be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
25 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
26 member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
27 to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
28 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,

1 agency, person, or circumstance may not be affected thereby.
2 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the commission may deny a state's participation
3 in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 13(2), terminate a member state's
4 participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material
5 departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact must be held to be contrary to the constitution of any
6 member state, the compact must remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full
7 force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.

69th Legislature 2025 SB 140.1
1 (1) A licensee can hold a multistate license, issued by their home state, in only one member state
2 at any given time.
3 (2) (a) If a licensee changes their home state by moving between two member states:
4 (i) the licensee shall immediately apply for the reissuance of their multistate license in their new
5 home state. The licensee shall pay all applicable fees and notify the prior home state in accordance with the
6 rules of the commission.
7 (ii) upon receipt of an application to reissue a multistate license, the new home state shall verify
8 that the multistate license is active, unencumbered, and eligible for reissuance under the terms of the compact
9 and the rules of the commission. The multistate license issued by the prior home state will be deactivated and
10 all member states notified in accordance with the applicable rules adopted by the commission.
11 (iii) prior to the reissuance of the multistate license, the new home state shall conduct procedures
12 for considering the criminal history records of the licensee. Such procedures must include the submission of
13 fingerprints or other biometric-based information by applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant's

17 requirements in the new home state.
18 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this compact, if a licensee does not meet the

21 state.
22 (3) If a licensee changes their primary state of residence by moving from a member state to a
23 nonmember state, or from a nonmember state to a member state, then the licensee must be subject to the state
24 requirements for the issuance of a single state license in the new home state.
25 (4) Nothing in this compact may interfere with a licensee's ability to hold a single state license in
26 multiple states; however, for the purposes of this compact, a licensee must have only one home state and only
27 one multistate license.
28 (5) Nothing in this compact may interfere with the requirements established by a member state for

5 multistate license. The individual may retain their home state designation during the period the service member
6 is on active duty.
7 SECTION 9

9 (1) (a) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a remote state must have the
10 authority, in accordance with existing state due process law, to take adverse action against a regulated social
11 worker's multistate authorization to practice only within that member state and issue subpoenas for both
12 hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of
13 evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing authority in a member state for the attendance and testimony of
14 witnesses or the production of evidence from another member state must be enforced in the latter state by any
15 court of competent jurisdiction according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas

18 evidence are located.
19 (b) Only the home state must have the power to take adverse action against a regulated social
20 worker's multistate license.
21 (2) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give the same priority and effect to
22 reported conduct received from a member state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the home state.
23 In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.

22 administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule must be invalid and have no force or effect only

14 (c) The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the

25 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
26 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
27 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
28 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – SB 140

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 140.1
1 default.
2 (4) Termination of membership in the compact must be imposed only after all other means of
3 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the

7 incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
8 termination.
9 (6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately

25 commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
26 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
27 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
28 reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The

10 (1) The compact must come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into
11 law in the seventh member state.
12 (a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the
13 enactment of each of the first seven member states, or charter member states, to determine if the statute
14 enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact statute.
15 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
16 compact statute must be entitled to the default process set forth in section 13.
17 (ii) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the
18 compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact must remain in effect even if the number
19 of member states should be less than seven.
20 (b) Member states enacting the compact after the seven initial charter member states must be
21 subject to the process set forth in section 10(3)(u) to determine if their enactments are materially different from
22 the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
23 (c) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the
24 administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
25 existence must be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the
26 commission.
27 (d) Any state that joins the compact after the commission's initial adoption of the rules and bylaws

1 state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission must have the full force and effect of law
2 on the day the compact becomes law in that state.
3 (2) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.
4 (a) A member state's withdrawal may not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the
5 repealing statute.
6 (b) Withdrawal may not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's licensing
7 authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
8 effective date of withdrawal.
9 (c) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately
10 provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
11 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to
12 this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
13 (3) Nothing contained in this compact may be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure
14 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
15 conflict with the provisions of this compact.
16 (4) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact may
17 become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
18 SECTION 15
19 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
20 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed to
21 effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
22 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's
23 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
24 (2) The provisions of this compact must be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
25 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
26 member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
27 to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
28 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,

1 agency, person, or circumstance may not be affected thereby.
2 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the commission may deny a state's participation
3 in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 13(2), terminate a member state's
4 participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material
5 departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact must be held to be contrary to the constitution of any
6 member state, the compact must remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full
7 force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
8 SECTION 16
9 CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH
10 OTHER STATE LAWS
11 (1) A licensee providing services in a remote state under a multistate authorization to practice shall
12 adhere to the laws and regulations, including laws, regulations, and applicable standards, of the remote state
13 where the client is located at the time care is rendered.
14 (2) Nothing herein may prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that
15 is not inconsistent with the compact.
16 (3) Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict with
17 the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
