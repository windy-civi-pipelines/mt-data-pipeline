11 consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to exercise the right or rights until the
12 consumer provides additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the
13 consumer's request to exercise the consumer's rights. A controller may not be required to authenticate an opt-
14 out request, but a controller may deny an opt-out request if the controller has a good faith, reasonable, and
15 documented belief that the request is fraudulent. If a controller denies an opt-out request because the controller
16 believes the request is fraudulent, the controller shall send notice to the person who made the request
17 disclosing that the controller believes the request is fraudulent and that the controller may not comply with the
18 request.
19 (e) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the
20 consumer must be deemed in compliance with the consumer's request to delete the consumer's data pursuant
21 to subsection (1)(c) by:
22 (i) retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of
23 ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the controller's records and not using the retained
24 data for any other purpose pursuant to the provisions of this part; or
25 (ii) opting the consumer out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for any purpose
26 except for those exempted pursuant to the provisions of this part.
27 (5) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to act on
28 a request within a reasonable period after the consumer's receipt of the decision. The appeal process must be
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 conspicuously available and like the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section.
2 Not later than 60 days after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action
3 taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If
4 the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or
5 other method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to submit a complaint."
6 (6) In response to a consumer request under subsection (1)(a), a controller may not disclose the
7 following information about a consumer but shall inform the consumer instead with sufficient particularity that
8 the controller has collected this information:
9 (a) social security number;
10 (b) driver's license number or other government-issued identification number;
11 (c) financial account number;
12 (d) health insurance account number or medical identification number;
13 (e) account password, security questions, or answer; or
14 (f) biometric data.

16 Section 6. Section 30-14-2812, MCA, is amended to read:
17 "30-14-2812. Data processing by controller -- limitations. (1) A controller shall:
18 (a) limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary in
19 relation to the purposes for which the personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer;
20 (b) establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data
21 security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data appropriate to the
22 volume and nature of the personal data at issue; and
23 (c) provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's consent under this
24 section that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's consent and,
25 on revocation of the consent, cease to process the personal data as soon as practicable, but not later than 45
26 days after the receipt of the request.
27 (2) A controller may not:
28 (a) except as otherwise provided in this part, process personal data for purposes that are not
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 reasonably necessary to or compatible with the disclosed purposes for which the personal data is processed as
2 disclosed to the consumer unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent;
3 (b) process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's consent or, in
4 the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without processing the sensitive data in
5 accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. 6501, et seq.;
6 (c) process personal data in violation of the laws of this state and federal laws that prohibit
7 unlawful discrimination against consumers;
8 (d) process the personal data of a consumer for the purposes of targeted advertising or sell the

11 age; or
12 (e) discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this
13 part, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a
14 different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer.
15 (3) Nothing in subsection (1) or (2) may be construed to require a controller to provide a product or
16 service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain or prohibit
17 a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer,
18 including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised their right to opt out pursuant to
19 this part or the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards,
20 premium features, discounts, or club card program.
21 (4) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted
22 advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the processing, as well as the way a
23 consumer may exercise the right to opt out of the processing in its privacy notice and provide access to a clear
24 and conspicuous method outside the privacy notice for a consumer to opt out of the sale or processing. This
25 method may include but is not limited to an internet hyperlink clearly labeled "your opt-out rights" or "your
26 privacy rights" that directly effectuates the opt-out request or takes consumers to a web page where the
27 consumer can make the opt-out request.
28 (5) A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 privacy notice that includes:
2 (a) the categories of personal data processed by the controller;
3 (b) the purpose for processing personal data;
4 (c) the categories of personal data that the controller sells to or shares with third parties, if any;
5 (d) the categories of third parties, if any, with which the controller sells or shares personal data;

10 consumer rights, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision regarding the consumer's
11 request. ; and
12 (g) the date the privacy notice was last updated.
13 (6) The privacy notice must be made available to the public in each language in which the
14 controller provides a product or service that is subject to the privacy notice or carries out activities related to the
15 product or service.
16 (7) The controller shall provide the privacy notice in a manner that is reasonably accessible to and
17 usable by individuals with disabilities.
18 (8) Whenever a controller makes a material change to the controller's privacy notice or practices,
19 the controller shall notify consumers affected by the material change with respect to any prospectively collected
20 personal data and provide a reasonable opportunity for consumers to withdraw consent to any further materially
21 different collection, processing, or transfer of previously collected personal data under the changed policy. The
22 controller shall take all reasonable electronic measures to provide notification regarding material changes to
23 affected consumers, taking into account available technology and the nature of the relationship.
24 (9) A controller is not required to provide a separate Montana-specific privacy notice or section of a
25 privacy notice if the controller's general privacy notice contains all the information required by this section.
26 (10) The privacy notice must be posted online through a conspicuous hyperlink using the word
27 "privacy" on the controller's website homepage or on a mobile device's application store page or download
28 page. A controller that maintains an application on a mobile device or other device shall also include a hyperlink

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 to the privacy notice in the application's settings menu or in a similarly conspicuous and accessible location. A
2 controller that does not operate a website shall make the privacy notice conspicuously available to consumers
3 through a medium regularly used by the controller to interact with consumers, including but not limited to mail.
4 (6)(11) (a) A controller shall establish and describe in a privacy notice one or more secure and reliable
5 means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to this part considering the
6 ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication
7 of consumer requests, and the ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request.
8 (b) A controller may not require a consumer to create a new account to exercise consumer rights
9 but may require a consumer to use an existing account."

11 Section 7. Section 30-14-2816, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "30-14-2816. Compliance by controller or processor. (1) Nothing in this part may be construed to
13 restrict a controller's or processor's ability to:
14 (a) comply with federal, state, or municipal ordinances or regulations;

21 (e) provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer;
22 (f) perform under a contract to which a consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of a
23 written warranty;
24 (g) take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering a contract;
25 (h) take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the
26 consumer or another individual and when the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis;
27 (i) prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud,
28 harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal activity, preserve the integrity or security of

69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 systems, or investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for any of these actions;
2 (j) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public interest that
3 adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored, and governed by an
4 institutional review board that determines or similar independent oversight entities that determine:
5 (A)(i) whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not
6 exclusively accrue to the controller;
7 (B)(ii) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and
8 (C)(iii) whether the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks
9 associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification;
10 (k) assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the obligations under this part; or
11 (l) process personal data for reasons of public interest in public health, community health, or
12 population health, but solely to the extent that the processing is:
13 (A)(i) subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the consumer whose
14 personal data is being processed; and
15 (B)(ii) under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations under federal,
16 state, or local law.
17 (2) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this part may not restrict a
18 controller's or processor's ability to collect, use, or retain personal data for internal use to:
19 (a) conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products, services, or technology;
20 (b) effectuate a product recall;
21 (c) identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or
22 (d) perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer
23 or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the controller or are otherwise
24 compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by
25 a consumer or the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
26 (3) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this part may not apply when
27 compliance by the controller or processor with this part would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of
28 this state. Nothing in this part may be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state as part
2 of a privileged communication.
3 (4) A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a processor or third-party controller in
4 accordance with this part may not be considered to have violated this part if the processor or third-party
5 controller that receives and processes the personal data violates this part provided, at the time the disclosing
6 controller or processor disclosed the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual
7 knowledge that the receiving processor or third-party controller would violate this part. A receiving processor or
8 third-party controller receiving personal data from a disclosing controller or processor in compliance with this
9 part is likewise not in violation of this part for the transgressions of the disclosing controller or processor from
10 which the receiving processor or third-party controller receives the personal data.
11 (5) Nothing in this part may be construed to:
12 (a) impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights or freedoms
13 of any person, including but not limited to the rights of any person:
14 (i) to freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed in the first amendment to the United
15 States constitution; or
16 (ii) under Rule 504 of the Montana Rules of Evidence; or
17 (b) apply to a person's processing of personal data during the person's personal or household
18 activities. ; or
19 (c) require a controller or processor to implement an age verification or age-gating system or
20 otherwise affirmatively collect the age of consumers, but a controller that chooses to conduct commercially
21 reasonable age estimation to determine which consumers are minors is not liable for an erroneous age
22 estimation.
23 (6) Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be processed to the
24 extent that the processing is:
25 (a) reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
26 (b) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in
27 this section. The controller or processor must, when applicable, consider the nature and purpose of the
28 collection, use, or retention of the personal data collected, used, or retained pursuant to subsection (2). The

1 personal data must be subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the
2 confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of
3 harm to consumers relating to the collection, use, or retention of personal data.
4 (7) If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller
5 bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the
6 requirements in subsection (6).
7 (8) Processing personal data for the purposes expressly identified in this section may not solely
8 make a legal entity a controller with respect to the processing."

10 Section 8. Section 30-14-2817, MCA, is amended to read:
11 "30-14-2817. Enforcement. (1) The attorney general has exclusive authority and may use the duties
12 and powers provided by Title 30, chapter 14, parts 1 and 2, to enforce violations pursuant to this part.

21 engaging in a violation of this part, the attorney general may issue a civil investigative demand pursuant to 30-
22 14-113.
23 (b) As part of a civil investigative demand, the attorney general may request that a controller
24 disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general.
25 The attorney general may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the requirements
26 pursuant to this part.
27 (2)(4) (a) The attorney general shall, prior to initiating any action for a violation of any provision of this
28 part, issue a notice of violation to the controller 30 days prior to bringing the action, identifying the specific
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 provisions of this part that the attorney general alleges have been or are being violated.
2 (b) If the controller fails to correct the violation within 60 30 days of receipt of the notice of violation,
3 the attorney general may bring an action pursuant to this section.
4 (c) If The attorney general may not bring an action against the controller if within the 60- day 30-
5 day period the controller corrects the noticed violation and provides the attorney general an express written
6 statement that:
7 (i) the alleged violations have been corrected and that no such further violations will occur, no
8 action must be initiated against the controller. ;
9 (ii) the controller has notified the consumer that the consumer's privacy violation was addressed, if
10 the consumer's contact information has been made available to the controller; and
11 (iii) the controller has made changes necessary to ensure that no further violations will occur.
12 (5) Actions brought by the department to enforce this part are subject to the statute of limitations
13 pursuant to 27-2-231.
14 (3)(6) Nothing in this part may be construed as providing the basis for or be subject to a private right
15 of action for violations of this part or any other law. (Subsection (2) terminates April 1, 2026--sec. 15, Ch. 681,
16 L. 2023.)"

18 NEW SECTION. Section 9. Duties of controllers -- duty of care -- rebuttable presumption. (1) (a)
19 A controller that offers an online service, product, or feature to a consumer whom the controller actually knows
20 or willfully disregards is a minor shall use reasonable care to avoid a heightened risk of harm to minors caused
21 by the online service, product, or feature.
22 (b) In an enforcement action brought by the attorney general pursuant to 30-14-2817, there is a
23 rebuttable presumption that a controller used reasonable care as required under this section if the controller
24 complied with this section.
25 (2) Unless a controller has obtained consent in accordance with subsection (3), a controller that
26 offers an online service, product, or feature to a consumer whom the controller actually knows or willfully
27 disregards is a minor may not:
28 (a) process a minor's personal data:

5 a consumer;
6 (ii) for any processing purpose other than the processing purpose that the controller disclosed at
7 the time the controller collected the minor's personal data or that is reasonably necessary for and compatible
8 with the processing purpose that the controller disclosed at the time the controller collected the minor's personal
9 data; or
10 (iii) for longer than is reasonably necessary to provide the online service, product, or feature;
11 (b) use a system design feature to significantly increase, sustain, or extend a minor's use of the
12 online service, product, or feature; or
13 (c) collect a minor's precise geolocation data unless:
14 (i) the minor's precise geolocation data is reasonably necessary for the controller to provide the
15 online service, product, or feature;
16 (ii) the controller only collects and retains the minor's precise geolocation data for the time
17 necessary to provide the online service, product, or feature; and
18 (iii) the controller provides to the minor a signal indicating that the controller is collecting the
19 minor's precise geolocation data and makes the signal available to the minor for the entire duration of the

21 application that is used by and under the direction of a ski area operator.
22 (3) (a) A controller may not engage in the activities described in subsection (2) unless the
23 controller obtains:
24 (i) the minor's consent; or
25 (ii) if the minor is a child, the consent of the minor's parent or legal guardian. A controller that
26 complies with the verifiable parental consent requirements established in the Children's Online Privacy
27 Protection Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. 6501, et seq., as amended, and the regulations, rules, guidance, and

4 (A) provide a consent mechanism that is designed to substantially subvert or impair or is

6 or
7 (B) except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), offer a direct messaging apparatus for use by a
8 minor without providing readily accessible and easy-to-use safeguards to limit the ability of an adult to send
9 unsolicited communications to the minor with whom the adult is not connected.
10 (ii) Subsection (3)(b)(i)(B) does not apply to an online service, product, or feature of which the

21
22 NEW SECTION. Section 10. Responsibility according to role -- processing data of minors. (1) A
23 processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller to meet the controller's
24 obligations under [sections 9 and 11], taking into account the nature of the processing and the information
25 available to the processor. The processor shall assist the controller by:
26 (a) taking appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the
27 fulfillment of the controller's obligations under [section 9]; and
28 (b) providing information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 assessments pursuant to [section 11].
2 (2) A contract between a controller and a processor must satisfy the requirements of 30-14-
3 2813(2).
4 (3) Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities
5 imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the controller's or processor's role in the processing
6 relationship as described in [sections 9 and 11].
7 (4) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific
8 processing of personal data is a fact-based determination that depends on the context in which personal data is
9 to be processed. A person that is not limited in the person's processing of personal data pursuant to a
10 controller's instructions or that fails to adhere to the instructions is a controller and not a processor with respect
11 to a specific processing of personal data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with
12 respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly
13 with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a
14 controller with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under 30-14-2817.

16 NEW SECTION. Section 11. Data protection assessments for heightened risk of harm to
17 minors. (1) A controller that, on or after October 1, 2025, offers an online service, product, or feature to a
18 consumer whom the controller actually knows or willfully disregards is a minor shall conduct a data protection
19 assessment for the online service, product, or feature if there is a heightened risk of harm to minors. The
20 controller shall conduct the data protection assessment:
21 (a) in a manner that is consistent with the requirements established in 30-14-2814; and
22 (b) to address:
23 (i) the purpose of the online service, product, or feature;
24 (ii) the categories of a minor's personal data that the online service, product, or feature processes;
25 (iii) the purposes for which the controller processes a minor's personal data with respect to the
26 online service, product, or feature; and
27 (iv) a heightened risk of harm to minors that is a reasonably foreseeable result of offering the
28 online service, product, or feature to minors.

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 (2) A controller that conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to subsection (1) shall:
2 (a) review the data protection assessment as necessary to account for a material change to the
3 processing operations of the online service, product, or feature that is the subject of the data protection
4 assessment; and
5 (b) maintain documentation concerning the data protection assessment for the longer of:
6 (i) 3 years after the date on which the processing operations cease; or
7 (ii) the date the controller ceases offering the online service, product, or feature.
8 (3) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations
9 that include similar activities.
10 (4) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying with another
11 applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment is considered to satisfy the requirements
12 established in this section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data
13 protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
14 (5) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to subsection (1) or a data
15 protection assessment review pursuant to subsection (2)(a) and determines that the online service, product, or
16 feature that is the subject of the assessment poses a heightened risk of harm to minors, the controller shall
17 establish and implement a plan to mitigate or eliminate the heightened risk.
18 (6) (a) A data protection assessment conducted pursuant to this section:
19 (i) is confidential, except as provided in subsection (6)(b); and
20 (ii) is not a public record and is exempt from public inspection and copying under the Freedom of
21 Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.
22 (b) (i) A controller shall make a data protection assessment conducted pursuant to this section
23 available to the attorney general on request. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection
24 assessment for compliance with this section and with other laws.
25 (ii) The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request from the attorney general
26 does not constitute a waiver of any attorney-client privilege or work-product protection that might otherwise
27 exist with respect to the assessment and any information in the assessment.
28 (7) Data protection assessment requirements apply to processing activities created or generated

24 (a) confirm whether a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and access the
25 consumer's personal data, unless such confirmation or access would require the controller to reveal a trade
26 secret;
27 (b) correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, considering the nature of the personal
28 data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data;
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 (c) delete personal data about the consumer;
2 (d) obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data previously provided by the consumer to the
3 controller in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the consumer to
4 transmit the personal data to another controller without hindrance when the processing is carried out by
5 automated means, provided the controller is not required to reveal any trade secret; and
6 (e) opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of:
7 (i) targeted advertising;
8 (ii) the sale of the consumer's personal data, except as provided in 30-14-2812(2); or
9 (iii) profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant
10 effects concerning the consumer.
11 (2) A consumer may exercise rights under this section by a secure and reliable means established
12 by the controller and described to the consumer in the controller's privacy notice.
13 (3) (a) A consumer may designate an authorized agent in accordance with 30-14-2809 to exercise
14 the rights of the consumer to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data under subsection (1)(e)
15 on behalf of the consumer.
16 (b) A parent or legal guardian of a known child may exercise the consumer rights on the known
17 child's behalf regarding the processing of personal data.
18 (c) A guardian or conservator of a consumer subject to a guardianship, conservatorship, or other
19 protective arrangement, may exercise the rights on the consumer's behalf regarding the processing of personal
20 data.
21 (4) Except as otherwise provided in this part, a controller shall comply with a request by a
22 consumer to exercise the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this section as follows:
23 (a) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after
24 receipt of the request. The controller may extend the response period by 45 additional days when reasonably
25 necessary, considering the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, provided the controller informs
26 the consumer of the extension within the initial 45-day response period and the reason for the extension.
27 (b) If a controller declines to act regarding the consumer's request, the controller shall inform the
28 consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after receipt of the request, of the justification for
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 declining to act and provide instructions for how to appeal the decision.
2 (c) Information provided in response to a consumer request must be provided by a controller, free
3 of charge, once for each consumer during any 12-month period. If requests from a consumer are manifestly
4 unfounded, excessive, technically infeasible, or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a
5 reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request.
6 The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive, technically infeasible, or
7 repetitive nature of the request.
8 (d) If a controller is unable to authenticate a request to exercise any of the rights afforded under
9 subsections (1)(a) through (1)(d) of this section using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller may not
10 be required to comply with a request to initiate an action pursuant to this section and shall provide notice to the
11 consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to exercise the right or rights until the
12 consumer provides additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the
13 consumer's request to exercise the consumer's rights. A controller may not be required to authenticate an opt-
14 out request, but a controller may deny an opt-out request if the controller has a good faith, reasonable, and
15 documented belief that the request is fraudulent. If a controller denies an opt-out request because the controller
16 believes the request is fraudulent, the controller shall send notice to the person who made the request
17 disclosing that the controller believes the request is fraudulent and that the controller may not comply with the
18 request.
19 (e) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the
20 consumer must be deemed in compliance with the consumer's request to delete the consumer's data pursuant
21 to subsection (1)(c) by:
22 (i) retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of
23 ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the controller's records and not using the retained
24 data for any other purpose pursuant to the provisions of this part; or
25 (ii) opting the consumer out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for any purpose
26 except for those exempted pursuant to the provisions of this part.
27 (5) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to act on
28 a request within a reasonable period after the consumer's receipt of the decision. The appeal process must be
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 conspicuously available and like the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section.
2 Not later than 60 days after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action
3 taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If
4 the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or
5 other method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to submit a complaint."
6 (6) In response to a consumer request under subsection (1)(a), a controller may not disclose the
7 following information about a consumer but shall inform the consumer instead with sufficient particularity that
8 the controller has collected this information:
9 (a) social security number;
10 (b) driver's license number or other government-issued identification number;
11 (c) financial account number;
12 (d) health insurance account number or medical identification number;
13 (e) account password, security questions, or answer; or

16 Section 6. Section 30-14-2812, MCA, is amended to read:
17 "30-14-2812. Data processing by controller -- limitations. (1) A controller shall:

21 security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data appropriate to the
22 volume and nature of the personal data at issue; and
23 (c) provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's consent under this
24 section that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's consent and,
25 on revocation of the consent, cease to process the personal data as soon as practicable, but not later than 45
26 days after the receipt of the request.
27 (2) A controller may not:
28 (a) except as otherwise provided in this part, process personal data for purposes that are not
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297

69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 reasonably necessary to or compatible with the disclosed purposes for which the personal data is processed as
2 disclosed to the consumer unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent;
3 (b) process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's consent or, in
4 the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without processing the sensitive data in

6 (c) process personal data in violation of the laws of this state and federal laws that prohibit
7 unlawful discrimination against consumers;
8 (d) process the personal data of a consumer for the purposes of targeted advertising or sell the

11 age; or
12 (e) discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this
13 part, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a
14 different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer.
15 (3) Nothing in subsection (1) or (2) may be construed to require a controller to provide a product or
16 service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain or prohibit
17 a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer,
18 including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised their right to opt out pursuant to
19 this part or the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards,
20 premium features, discounts, or club card program.
21 (4) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted
22 advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the processing, as well as the way a
23 consumer may exercise the right to opt out of the processing in its privacy notice and provide access to a clear
24 and conspicuous method outside the privacy notice for a consumer to opt out of the sale or processing. This
25 method may include but is not limited to an internet hyperlink clearly labeled "your opt-out rights" or "your
26 privacy rights" that directly effectuates the opt-out request or takes consumers to a web page where the

1 privacy notice that includes:
2 (a) the categories of personal data processed by the controller;

13 (6) The privacy notice must be made available to the public in each language in which the
14 controller provides a product or service that is subject to the privacy notice or carries out activities related to the
15 product or service.
16 (7) The controller shall provide the privacy notice in a manner that is reasonably accessible to and
17 usable by individuals with disabilities.
18 (8) Whenever a controller makes a material change to the controller's privacy notice or practices,
19 the controller shall notify consumers affected by the material change with respect to any prospectively collected
20 personal data and provide a reasonable opportunity for consumers to withdraw consent to any further materially
21 different collection, processing, or transfer of previously collected personal data under the changed policy. The
22 controller shall take all reasonable electronic measures to provide notification regarding material changes to
23 affected consumers, taking into account available technology and the nature of the relationship.
24 (9) A controller is not required to provide a separate Montana-specific privacy notice or section of a

2 controller that does not operate a website shall make the privacy notice conspicuously available to consumers
3 through a medium regularly used by the controller to interact with consumers, including but not limited to mail.
4 (6)(11) (a) A controller shall establish and describe in a privacy notice one or more secure and reliable
5 means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to this part considering the
6 ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication
7 of consumer requests, and the ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request.
8 (b) A controller may not require a consumer to create a new account to exercise consumer rights
9 but may require a consumer to use an existing account."

12 "30-14-2816. Compliance by controller or processor. (1) Nothing in this part may be construed to

69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 systems, or investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for any of these actions;
2 (j) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public interest that
3 adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored, and governed by an
4 institutional review board that determines or similar independent oversight entities that determine:
5 (A)(i) whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not
6 exclusively accrue to the controller;
7 (B)(ii) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and
8 (C)(iii) whether the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks
9 associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification;
10 (k) assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the obligations under this part; or

15 (B)(ii) under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations under federal,
16 state, or local law.
17 (2) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this part may not restrict a

26 (3) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this part may not apply when
27 compliance by the controller or processor with this part would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of
28 this state. Nothing in this part may be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state as part
2 of a privileged communication.
3 (4) A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a processor or third-party controller in
4 accordance with this part may not be considered to have violated this part if the processor or third-party
5 controller that receives and processes the personal data violates this part provided, at the time the disclosing
6 controller or processor disclosed the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual
7 knowledge that the receiving processor or third-party controller would violate this part. A receiving processor or
8 third-party controller receiving personal data from a disclosing controller or processor in compliance with this
9 part is likewise not in violation of this part for the transgressions of the disclosing controller or processor from
10 which the receiving processor or third-party controller receives the personal data.
11 (5) Nothing in this part may be construed to:
12 (a) impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights or freedoms

15 States constitution; or
16 (ii) under Rule 504 of the Montana Rules of Evidence; or

18 activities. ; or
19 (c) require a controller or processor to implement an age verification or age-gating system or
20 otherwise affirmatively collect the age of consumers, but a controller that chooses to conduct commercially
21 reasonable age estimation to determine which consumers are minors is not liable for an erroneous age
22 estimation.
23 (6) Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be processed to the
24 extent that the processing is:
25 (a) reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
26 (b) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in
27 this section. The controller or processor must, when applicable, consider the nature and purpose of the
28 collection, use, or retention of the personal data collected, used, or retained pursuant to subsection (2). The

2 confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of
3 harm to consumers relating to the collection, use, or retention of personal data.
4 (7) If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller
5 bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the
6 requirements in subsection (6).

8 make a legal entity a controller with respect to the processing."

10 Section 8. Section 30-14-2817, MCA, is amended to read:
11 "30-14-2817. Enforcement. (1) The attorney general has exclusive authority and may use the duties

23 (b) As part of a civil investigative demand, the attorney general may request that a controller
24 disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general.
25 The attorney general may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the requirements
26 pursuant to this part.

22 NEW SECTION. Section 10. Responsibility according to role -- processing data of minors. (1) A
23 processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller to meet the controller's
24 obligations under [sections 9 and 11], taking into account the nature of the processing and the information
25 available to the processor. The processor shall assist the controller by:
26 (a) taking appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the
27 fulfillment of the controller's obligations under [section 9]; and
28 (b) providing information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection

69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 assessments pursuant to [section 11].
2 (2) A contract between a controller and a processor must satisfy the requirements of 30-14-
3 2813(2).
4 (3) Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities
5 imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the controller's or processor's role in the processing
6 relationship as described in [sections 9 and 11].
7 (4) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific
8 processing of personal data is a fact-based determination that depends on the context in which personal data is
9 to be processed. A person that is not limited in the person's processing of personal data pursuant to a
10 controller's instructions or that fails to adhere to the instructions is a controller and not a processor with respect
11 to a specific processing of personal data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with
12 respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly
13 with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a
14 controller with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under 30-14-2817.

16 NEW SECTION. Section 11. Data protection assessments for heightened risk of harm to
17 minors. (1) A controller that, on or after October 1, 2025, offers an online service, product, or feature to a

19 assessment for the online service, product, or feature if there is a heightened risk of harm to minors. The
20 controller shall conduct the data protection assessment:
21 (a) in a manner that is consistent with the requirements established in 30-14-2814; and
22 (b) to address:
23 (i) the purpose of the online service, product, or feature;
24 (ii) the categories of a minor's personal data that the online service, product, or feature processes;
25 (iii) the purposes for which the controller processes a minor's personal data with respect to the
26 online service, product, or feature; and
27 (iv) a heightened risk of harm to minors that is a reasonably foreseeable result of offering the
28 online service, product, or feature to minors.

69th Legislature 2025 SB0297.2
1 (2) A controller that conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to subsection (1) shall:
2 (a) review the data protection assessment as necessary to account for a material change to the
3 processing operations of the online service, product, or feature that is the subject of the data protection
4 assessment; and
5 (b) maintain documentation concerning the data protection assessment for the longer of:
6 (i) 3 years after the date on which the processing operations cease; or
7 (ii) the date the controller ceases offering the online service, product, or feature.
8 (3) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations
9 that include similar activities.
10 (4) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying with another
11 applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment is considered to satisfy the requirements
12 established in this section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data
13 protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
14 (5) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to subsection (1) or a data
15 protection assessment review pursuant to subsection (2)(a) and determines that the online service, product, or

18 (6) (a) A data protection assessment conducted pursuant to this section:
19 (i) is confidential, except as provided in subsection (6)(b); and
20 (ii) is not a public record and is exempt from public inspection and copying under the Freedom of
21 Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.
22 (b) (i) A controller shall make a data protection assessment conducted pursuant to this section
23 available to the attorney general on request. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection
24 assessment for compliance with this section and with other laws.
25 (ii) The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request from the attorney general
26 does not constitute a waiver of any attorney-client privilege or work-product protection that might otherwise
27 exist with respect to the assessment and any information in the assessment.
28 (7) Data protection assessment requirements apply to processing activities created or generated
