ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
(a) confirm whether a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and access the

data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data;

controller in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the consumer to
transmit the personal data to another controller without hindrance when the processing is carried out by
automated means, provided the controller is not required to reveal any trade secret; and
(e) opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of:
(i) targeted advertising;
(ii) the sale of the consumer's personal data, except as provided in 30-14-2812(2); or
(iii) profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant
effects concerning the consumer.
(2) A consumer may exercise rights under this section by a secure and reliable means established
by the controller and described to the consumer in the controller's privacy notice.
(3) (a) A consumer may designate an authorized agent in accordance with 30-14-2809 to exercise
the rights of the consumer to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data under subsection (1)(e)
on behalf of the consumer.

consumer to exercise the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this section as follows:
(a) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
receipt of the request. The controller may extend the response period by 45 additional days when reasonably
necessary, considering the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, provided the controller informs
the consumer of the extension within the initial 45-day response period and the reason for the extension.
(b) If a controller declines to act regarding the consumer's request, the controller shall inform the
consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after receipt of the request, of the justification for
declining to act and provide instructions for how to appeal the decision.
(c) Information provided in response to a consumer request must be provided by a controller, free
of charge, once for each consumer during any 12-month period. If requests from a consumer are manifestly
unfounded, excessive, technically infeasible, or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a
reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request.
The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive, technically infeasible, or
repetitive nature of the request.
(d) If a controller is unable to authenticate a request to exercise any of the rights afforded under
subsections (1)(a) through (1)(d) of this section using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller may not
be required to comply with a request to initiate an action pursuant to this section and shall provide notice to the
consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to exercise the right or rights until the
consumer provides additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the
consumer's request to exercise the consumer's rights. A controller may not be required to authenticate an opt-
out request, but a controller may deny an opt-out request if the controller has a good faith, reasonable, and
documented belief that the request is fraudulent. If a controller denies an opt-out request because the controller
believes the request is fraudulent, the controller shall send notice to the person who made the request
disclosing that the controller believes the request is fraudulent and that the controller may not comply with the
request.
(e) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the
consumer must be deemed in compliance with the consumer's request to delete the consumer's data pursuant
to subsection (1)(c) by:
(i) retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of
ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the controller's records and not using the retained
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297

(ii) opting the consumer out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for any purpose
except for those exempted pursuant to the provisions of this part.
(5) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to act on
a request within a reasonable period after the consumer's receipt of the decision. The appeal process must be
conspicuously available and like the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section.
Not later than 60 days after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action
taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If
the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or
other method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to submit a complaint."

following information about a consumer but shall inform the consumer instead with sufficient particularity that

(a) except as otherwise provided in this part, process personal data for purposes that are not
reasonably necessary to or compatible with the disclosed purposes for which the personal data is processed as
disclosed to the consumer unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent;

age; or
(e) discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this
part, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a

service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain or prohibit
a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer,
including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised their right to opt out pursuant to
this part or the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards,
premium features, discounts, or club card program.
(4) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted
advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the processing, as well as the way a

consumer rights, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision regarding the consumer's
request. ; and
(g) the date the privacy notice was last updated.
(6) The privacy notice must be made available to the public in each language in which the
controller provides a product or service that is subject to the privacy notice or carries out activities related to the
product or service.
(7) The controller shall provide the privacy notice in a manner that is reasonably accessible to and
usable by individuals with disabilities.
(8) Whenever a controller makes a material change to the controller's privacy notice or practices,
the controller shall notify consumers affected by the material change with respect to any prospectively collected
personal data and provide a reasonable opportunity for consumers to withdraw consent to any further materially
different collection, processing, or transfer of previously collected personal data under the changed policy. The
controller shall take all reasonable electronic measures to provide notification regarding material changes to
affected consumers, taking into account available technology and the nature of the relationship.

(9) A controller is not required to provide a separate Montana-specific privacy notice or section of a
privacy notice if the controller's general privacy notice contains all the information required by this section.
(10) The privacy notice must be posted online through a conspicuous hyperlink using the word
"privacy" on the controller's website homepage or on a mobile device's application store page or download
page. A controller that maintains an application on a mobile device or other device shall also include a hyperlink
to the privacy notice in the application's settings menu or in a similarly conspicuous and accessible location. A
controller that does not operate a website shall make the privacy notice conspicuously available to consumers
through a medium regularly used by the controller to interact with consumers, including but not limited to mail.
(6)(11) (a) A controller shall establish and describe in a privacy notice one or more secure and reliable
means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to this part considering the
ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication
of consumer requests, and the ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request.
(b) A controller may not require a consumer to create a new account to exercise consumer rights
but may require a consumer to use an existing account."

Section 9:
Section 7. Section 30-14-2816, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-14-2816. Compliance by controller or processor. (1) Nothing in this part may be construed to
restrict a controller's or processor's ability to:
(a) comply with federal, state, or municipal ordinances or regulations;
(b) comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by
federal, state, municipal, or other government authorities;

processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or municipal ordinances or
regulations;

(g) take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering a contract;
(h) take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the
consumer or another individual and when the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis;
(i) prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud,
harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal activity, preserve the integrity or security of
systems, or investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for any of these actions;
(j) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public interest that
adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored, and governed by an
institutional review board that determines or similar independent oversight entities that determine:
(A)(i) whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not
exclusively accrue to the controller;
(B)(ii) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and
(C)(iii) whether the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks
associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification;
(k) assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the obligations under this part; or
(l) process personal data for reasons of public interest in public health, community health, or
population health, but solely to the extent that the processing is:
(A)(i) subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the consumer whose
personal data is being processed; and
(B)(ii) under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations under federal,
state, or local law.
(2) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this part may not restrict a
controller's or processor's ability to collect, use, or retain personal data for internal use to:
(a) conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products, services, or technology;
(b) effectuate a product recall;
(c) identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or

69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by
a consumer or the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
(3) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this part may not apply when
compliance by the controller or processor with this part would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of
this state. Nothing in this part may be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal
data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state as part
of a privileged communication.
(4) A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a processor or third-party controller in
accordance with this part may not be considered to have violated this part if the processor or third-party
controller that receives and processes the personal data violates this part provided, at the time the disclosing
controller or processor disclosed the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual
knowledge that the receiving processor or third-party controller would violate this part. A receiving processor or
third-party controller receiving personal data from a disclosing controller or processor in compliance with this
part is likewise not in violation of this part for the transgressions of the disclosing controller or processor from
which the receiving processor or third-party controller receives the personal data.
(5) Nothing in this part may be construed to:
(a) impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights or freedoms
of any person, including but not limited to the rights of any person:
(i) to freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed in the first amendment to the United
States constitution; or
(ii) under Rule 504 of the Montana Rules of Evidence; or
(b) apply to a person's processing of personal data during the person's personal or household
activities. ; or
(c) require a controller or processor to implement an age verification or age-gating system or
otherwise affirmatively collect the age of consumers, but a controller that chooses to conduct commercially
reasonable age estimation to determine which consumers are minors is not liable for an erroneous age
estimation.
(6) Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be processed to the
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
extent that the processing is:
(a) reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
(b) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in
this section. The controller or processor must, when applicable, consider the nature and purpose of the
collection, use, or retention of the personal data collected, used, or retained pursuant to subsection (2). The
personal data must be subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the
confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of
harm to consumers relating to the collection, use, or retention of personal data.
(7) If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller
bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the
requirements in subsection (6).
(8) Processing personal data for the purposes expressly identified in this section may not solely
make a legal entity a controller with respect to the processing."

Section 10:
Section 8. Section 30-14-2817, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-14-2817. Enforcement. (1) The attorney general has exclusive authority and may use the duties
and powers provided by Title 30, chapter 14, parts 1 and 2, to enforce violations pursuant to this part.
(2) The attorney general shall post on the attorney general's website:
(a) information relating to:
(i) the responsibilities of a controller pursuant to this part;
(ii) the responsibilities of a processor pursuant to this part; and
(iii) a consumer's rights pursuant to this part; and
(b) an online mechanism through which a consumer may submit a complaint regarding consumer
data privacy to the attorney general.
(3) (a) If the attorney general has reasonable cause to believe that a person has engaged in or is
engaging in a violation of this part, the attorney general may issue a civil investigative demand pursuant to 30-
14-113.
(b) As part of a civil investigative demand, the attorney general may request that a controller
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general.
The attorney general may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the requirements
pursuant to this part.
(2) (a) The attorney general shall, prior to initiating any action for a violation of any provision of this
part, issue a notice of violation to the controller.
(b) If the controller fails to correct the violation within 60 days of receipt of the notice of violation,
the attorney general may bring an action pursuant to this section.
(c) If within the 60- day period the controller corrects the noticed violation and provides the
attorney general an express written statement that
the alleged violations have been corrected and that no such further violations will occur, no action must
be initiated against the controller.
(4) Actions brought by the department to enforce this part are subject to the statute of limitations
pursuant to 27-2-231.
(3)(5) Nothing in this part may be construed as providing the basis for or be subject to a private right
of action for violations of this part or any other law. (Subsection (2) terminates April 1, 2026--sec. 15, Ch. 681,
L. 2023.)"

Section 11:
Section 9. Duties of controllers -- duty of care -- rebuttable presumption. (1) (a) A controller that
offers an online service, product, or feature to a consumer whom the controller actually knows or willfully
disregards is a minor shall use reasonable care to avoid a heightened risk of harm to minors caused by the
online service, product, or feature.
(b) In an enforcement action brought by the attorney general pursuant to 30-14-2817, there is a
rebuttable presumption that a controller used reasonable care as required under this section if the controller
complied with this section.
(2) Unless a controller has obtained consent in accordance with subsection (3), a controller that
offers an online service, product, or feature to a consumer whom the controller actually knows or willfully
disregards is a minor may not:
(a) process a minor's personal data:
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
ENROLLED BILL

(C) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning
a consumer;

the time the controller collected the minor's personal data or that is reasonably necessary for and compatible
with the processing purpose that the controller disclosed at the time the controller collected the minor's personal
data; or
(iii) for longer than is reasonably necessary to provide the online service, product, or feature;
(b) use a system design feature to significantly increase, sustain, or extend a minor's use of the
online service, product, or feature; or

online service, product, or feature;
(ii) the controller only collects and retains the minor's precise geolocation data for the time
necessary to provide the online service, product, or feature; and
(iii) the controller provides to the minor a signal indicating that the controller is collecting the
minor's precise geolocation data and makes the signal available to the minor for the entire duration of the
collection of the minor's precise geolocation data. This subsection (2)(c)(iii) does not apply to a service or
application that is used by and under the direction of a ski area operator.
(3) (a) A controller may not engage in the activities described in subsection (2) unless the
controller obtains:
(i) the minor's consent; or
(ii) if the minor is a child, the consent of the minor's parent or legal guardian. A controller that
complies with the verifiable parental consent requirements established in the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. 6501, et seq., as amended, and the regulations, rules, guidance, and
exemptions adopted pursuant to this act, as amended, is considered to have satisfied any requirement to obtain
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
parental consent under this subsection (3)(a)(ii).
(b) (i) A controller that offers an online service, product, or feature to a consumer whom the
controller actually knows or willfully disregards is a minor may not:
(A) provide a consent mechanism that is designed to substantially subvert or impair or is
manipulated with the effect of substantially subverting or impairing user autonomy, decision-making, or choice;
or

minor without providing readily accessible and easy-to-use safeguards to limit the ability of an adult to send
unsolicited communications to the minor with whom the adult is not connected.
(ii) Subsection (3)(b)(i)(B) does not apply to an online service, product, or feature of which the

Section 12:
Section 10. Responsibility according to role -- processing data of minors. (1) A processor shall
adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller to meet the controller's obligations under
[sections 9 and 11], taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to the
processor. The processor shall assist the controller by:
(a) taking appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the
fulfillment of the controller's obligations under [section 9]; and
(b) providing information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection

ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
assessments pursuant to [section 11].
(2) A contract between a controller and a processor must satisfy the requirements of 30-14-
2813(2).
(3) Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities
imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the controller's or processor's role in the processing
relationship as described in [sections 9 and 11].
(4) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific
processing of personal data is a fact-based determination that depends on the context in which personal data is
to be processed. A person that is not limited in the person's processing of personal data pursuant to a
controller's instructions or that fails to adhere to the instructions is a controller and not a processor with respect
to a specific processing of personal data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with
respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly
with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a
controller with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under 30-14-2817.

Section 13:
Section 11. Data protection assessments for heightened risk of harm to minors. (1) A controller
that, on or after October 1, 2025, offers an online service, product, or feature to a consumer whom the
controller actually knows or willfully disregards is a minor shall conduct a data protection assessment for the
online service, product, or feature if there is a heightened risk of harm to minors. The controller shall conduct
the data protection assessment:
(a) in a manner that is consistent with the requirements established in 30-14-2814; and
(b) to address:
(i) the purpose of the online service, product, or feature;
(ii) the categories of a minor's personal data that the online service, product, or feature processes;
(iii) the purposes for which the controller processes a minor's personal data with respect to the
online service, product, or feature; and
(iv) a heightened risk of harm to minors that is a reasonably foreseeable result of offering the
online service, product, or feature to minors.

ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
(2) A controller that conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to subsection (1) shall:
(a) review the data protection assessment as necessary to account for a material change to the
processing operations of the online service, product, or feature that is the subject of the data protection
assessment; and
(b) maintain documentation concerning the data protection assessment for the longer of:
(i) 3 years after the date on which the processing operations cease; or
(ii) the date the controller ceases offering the online service, product, or feature.
(3) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations
that include similar activities.
(4) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying with another
applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment is considered to satisfy the requirements
established in this section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data
protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
(5) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to subsection (1) or a data
protection assessment review pursuant to subsection (2)(a) and determines that the online service, product, or
feature that is the subject of the assessment poses a heightened risk of harm to minors, the controller shall
establish and implement a plan to mitigate or eliminate the heightened risk.
(6) (a) A data protection assessment conducted pursuant to this section:
(i) is confidential, except as provided in subsection (6)(b); and
(ii) is not a public record and is exempt from public inspection and copying under the Freedom of
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.
(b) (i) A controller shall make a data protection assessment conducted pursuant to this section
available to the attorney general on request. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection
assessment for compliance with this section and with other laws.
(ii) The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request from the attorney general
does not constitute a waiver of any attorney-client privilege or work-product protection that might otherwise
exist with respect to the assessment and any information in the assessment.
(7) Data protection assessment requirements apply to processing activities created or generated

parts 1 and 2.

incurred in investigating and bring an action under this section.

ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
(a) confirm whether a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and access the

data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data;

transmit the personal data to another controller without hindrance when the processing is carried out by
automated means, provided the controller is not required to reveal any trade secret; and
(e) opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of:
(i) targeted advertising;
(ii) the sale of the consumer's personal data, except as provided in 30-14-2812(2); or
(iii) profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant
effects concerning the consumer.

by the controller and described to the consumer in the controller's privacy notice.
(3) (a) A consumer may designate an authorized agent in accordance with 30-14-2809 to exercise
the rights of the consumer to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data under subsection (1)(e)

consumer to exercise the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this section as follows:
(a) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
receipt of the request. The controller may extend the response period by 45 additional days when reasonably
necessary, considering the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, provided the controller informs
the consumer of the extension within the initial 45-day response period and the reason for the extension.
(b) If a controller declines to act regarding the consumer's request, the controller shall inform the
consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after receipt of the request, of the justification for
declining to act and provide instructions for how to appeal the decision.
(c) Information provided in response to a consumer request must be provided by a controller, free
of charge, once for each consumer during any 12-month period. If requests from a consumer are manifestly
unfounded, excessive, technically infeasible, or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a
reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request.
The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive, technically infeasible, or
repetitive nature of the request.

subsections (1)(a) through (1)(d) of this section using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller may not
be required to comply with a request to initiate an action pursuant to this section and shall provide notice to the
consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to exercise the right or rights until the
consumer provides additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the
consumer's request to exercise the consumer's rights. A controller may not be required to authenticate an opt-
out request, but a controller may deny an opt-out request if the controller has a good faith, reasonable, and
documented belief that the request is fraudulent. If a controller denies an opt-out request because the controller
believes the request is fraudulent, the controller shall send notice to the person who made the request
disclosing that the controller believes the request is fraudulent and that the controller may not comply with the
request.
(e) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the
consumer must be deemed in compliance with the consumer's request to delete the consumer's data pursuant
to subsection (1)(c) by:
(i) retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of
ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the controller's records and not using the retained

(ii) opting the consumer out of the processing of the consumer's personal data for any purpose
except for those exempted pursuant to the provisions of this part.
(5) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to act on
a request within a reasonable period after the consumer's receipt of the decision. The appeal process must be
conspicuously available and like the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section.
Not later than 60 days after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action
taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If
the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or
other method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to submit a complaint."

section that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's consent and,
on revocation of the consent, cease to process the personal data as soon as practicable, but not later than 45
days after the receipt of the request.
(2) A controller may not:
(a) except as otherwise provided in this part, process personal data for purposes that are not
reasonably necessary to or compatible with the disclosed purposes for which the personal data is processed as
disclosed to the consumer unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent;
(b) process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's consent or, in

(c) process personal data in violation of the laws of this state and federal laws that prohibit
unlawful discrimination against consumers;
(d) process the personal data of a consumer for the purposes of targeted advertising or sell the
consumer's personal data without the consumer's consent under circumstances in which a controller has actual

age; or
(e) discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this
part, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a
different level of quality of goods or services to the consumer.
(3) Nothing in subsection (1) or (2) may be construed to require a controller to provide a product or
service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain or prohibit
a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer,
including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised their right to opt out pursuant to
this part or the offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards,
premium features, discounts, or club card program.
(4) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted
advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the processing, as well as the way a
consumer may exercise the right to opt out of the processing in its privacy notice and provide access to a clear

privacy rights" that directly effectuates the opt-out request or takes consumers to a web page where the
consumer can make the opt-out request.
(5) A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear, and meaningful

(e) an active e-mail address or other mechanism that the consumer may use to contact the
controller; and
(f) an explanation of the rights provided by 30-14-2808(1) and how consumers may exercise their
consumer rights, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision regarding the consumer's
request. ; and
(g) the date the privacy notice was last updated.
(6) The privacy notice must be made available to the public in each language in which the
controller provides a product or service that is subject to the privacy notice or carries out activities related to the
product or service.
(7) The controller shall provide the privacy notice in a manner that is reasonably accessible to and
usable by individuals with disabilities.
(8) Whenever a controller makes a material change to the controller's privacy notice or practices,
the controller shall notify consumers affected by the material change with respect to any prospectively collected
personal data and provide a reasonable opportunity for consumers to withdraw consent to any further materially
different collection, processing, or transfer of previously collected personal data under the changed policy. The
controller shall take all reasonable electronic measures to provide notification regarding material changes to
affected consumers, taking into account available technology and the nature of the relationship.

(9) A controller is not required to provide a separate Montana-specific privacy notice or section of a
privacy notice if the controller's general privacy notice contains all the information required by this section.
(10) The privacy notice must be posted online through a conspicuous hyperlink using the word
"privacy" on the controller's website homepage or on a mobile device's application store page or download
page. A controller that maintains an application on a mobile device or other device shall also include a hyperlink
to the privacy notice in the application's settings menu or in a similarly conspicuous and accessible location. A
controller that does not operate a website shall make the privacy notice conspicuously available to consumers
through a medium regularly used by the controller to interact with consumers, including but not limited to mail.
(6)(11) (a) A controller shall establish and describe in a privacy notice one or more secure and reliable
means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to this part considering the
ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication
of consumer requests, and the ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request.
(b) A controller may not require a consumer to create a new account to exercise consumer rights
but may require a consumer to use an existing account."
Section 7. Section 30-14-2816, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-14-2816. Compliance by controller or processor. (1) Nothing in this part may be construed to
restrict a controller's or processor's ability to:
(a) comply with federal, state, or municipal ordinances or regulations;
(b) comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by
federal, state, municipal, or other government authorities;
(c) cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or
processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or municipal ordinances or
regulations;
(d) investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for, or defend legal claims;
(e) provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer;

(g) take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering a contract;
(h) take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the
consumer or another individual and when the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis;
(i) prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud,
harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal activity, preserve the integrity or security of
systems, or investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for any of these actions;
(j) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public interest that
adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored, and governed by an
institutional review board that determines or similar independent oversight entities that determine:
(A)(i) whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not
exclusively accrue to the controller;
(B)(ii) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and
(C)(iii) whether the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks
associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification;
(k) assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the obligations under this part; or
(l) process personal data for reasons of public interest in public health, community health, or
population health, but solely to the extent that the processing is:
(A)(i) subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the consumer whose
personal data is being processed; and
(B)(ii) under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations under federal,
state, or local law.
(2) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this part may not restrict a
controller's or processor's ability to collect, use, or retain personal data for internal use to:
(a) conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products, services, or technology;
(b) effectuate a product recall;
(c) identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or
(d) perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer

ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by
a consumer or the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
(3) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this part may not apply when
compliance by the controller or processor with this part would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of
this state. Nothing in this part may be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal
data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state as part
of a privileged communication.
(4) A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a processor or third-party controller in
accordance with this part may not be considered to have violated this part if the processor or third-party
controller that receives and processes the personal data violates this part provided, at the time the disclosing
controller or processor disclosed the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual
knowledge that the receiving processor or third-party controller would violate this part. A receiving processor or
third-party controller receiving personal data from a disclosing controller or processor in compliance with this
part is likewise not in violation of this part for the transgressions of the disclosing controller or processor from
which the receiving processor or third-party controller receives the personal data.
(5) Nothing in this part may be construed to:
(a) impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights or freedoms
of any person, including but not limited to the rights of any person:
(i) to freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed in the first amendment to the United
States constitution; or
(ii) under Rule 504 of the Montana Rules of Evidence; or
(b) apply to a person's processing of personal data during the person's personal or household
activities. ; or
(c) require a controller or processor to implement an age verification or age-gating system or
otherwise affirmatively collect the age of consumers, but a controller that chooses to conduct commercially
reasonable age estimation to determine which consumers are minors is not liable for an erroneous age
estimation.
(6) Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be processed to the
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
extent that the processing is:
(a) reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
(b) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in
this section. The controller or processor must, when applicable, consider the nature and purpose of the
collection, use, or retention of the personal data collected, used, or retained pursuant to subsection (2). The
personal data must be subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the
confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of
harm to consumers relating to the collection, use, or retention of personal data.
(7) If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller
bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the
requirements in subsection (6).
(8) Processing personal data for the purposes expressly identified in this section may not solely
make a legal entity a controller with respect to the processing."
Section 8. Section 30-14-2817, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-14-2817. Enforcement. (1) The attorney general has exclusive authority and may use the duties
and powers provided by Title 30, chapter 14, parts 1 and 2, to enforce violations pursuant to this part.
(2) The attorney general shall post on the attorney general's website:
(a) information relating to:
(i) the responsibilities of a controller pursuant to this part;
(ii) the responsibilities of a processor pursuant to this part; and
(iii) a consumer's rights pursuant to this part; and
(b) an online mechanism through which a consumer may submit a complaint regarding consumer
data privacy to the attorney general.
(3) (a) If the attorney general has reasonable cause to believe that a person has engaged in or is
engaging in a violation of this part, the attorney general may issue a civil investigative demand pursuant to 30-
14-113.
(b) As part of a civil investigative demand, the attorney general may request that a controller
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general.
The attorney general may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the requirements
pursuant to this part.
(2) (a) The attorney general shall, prior to initiating any action for a violation of any provision of this
part, issue a notice of violation to the controller.
(b) If the controller fails to correct the violation within 60 days of receipt of the notice of violation,
the attorney general may bring an action pursuant to this section.
(c) If within the 60- day period the controller corrects the noticed violation and provides the
attorney general an express written statement that
the alleged violations have been corrected and that no such further violations will occur, no action must
be initiated against the controller.
(4) Actions brought by the department to enforce this part are subject to the statute of limitations
pursuant to 27-2-231.
(3)(5) Nothing in this part may be construed as providing the basis for or be subject to a private right
of action for violations of this part or any other law. (Subsection (2) terminates April 1, 2026--sec. 15, Ch. 681,
L. 2023.)"
Section 9. Duties of controllers -- duty of care -- rebuttable presumption. (1) (a) A controller that
offers an online service, product, or feature to a consumer whom the controller actually knows or willfully
disregards is a minor shall use reasonable care to avoid a heightened risk of harm to minors caused by the
online service, product, or feature.
(b) In an enforcement action brought by the attorney general pursuant to 30-14-2817, there is a
rebuttable presumption that a controller used reasonable care as required under this section if the controller
complied with this section.
(2) Unless a controller has obtained consent in accordance with subsection (3), a controller that
offers an online service, product, or feature to a consumer whom the controller actually knows or willfully
disregards is a minor may not:
(a) process a minor's personal data:
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
(i) for the purposes of:
(A) targeted advertising;

(C) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning
a consumer;
(ii) for any processing purpose other than the processing purpose that the controller disclosed at
the time the controller collected the minor's personal data or that is reasonably necessary for and compatible
with the processing purpose that the controller disclosed at the time the controller collected the minor's personal
data; or
(iii) for longer than is reasonably necessary to provide the online service, product, or feature;
(b) use a system design feature to significantly increase, sustain, or extend a minor's use of the
online service, product, or feature; or

online service, product, or feature;
(ii) the controller only collects and retains the minor's precise geolocation data for the time
necessary to provide the online service, product, or feature; and
(iii) the controller provides to the minor a signal indicating that the controller is collecting the
minor's precise geolocation data and makes the signal available to the minor for the entire duration of the
collection of the minor's precise geolocation data. This subsection (2)(c)(iii) does not apply to a service or
application that is used by and under the direction of a ski area operator.
(3) (a) A controller may not engage in the activities described in subsection (2) unless the
controller obtains:
(i) the minor's consent; or
(ii) if the minor is a child, the consent of the minor's parent or legal guardian. A controller that
complies with the verifiable parental consent requirements established in the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act of 1998, 15 U.S.C. 6501, et seq., as amended, and the regulations, rules, guidance, and
exemptions adopted pursuant to this act, as amended, is considered to have satisfied any requirement to obtain
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – SB 297
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
parental consent under this subsection (3)(a)(ii).
(b) (i) A controller that offers an online service, product, or feature to a consumer whom the
controller actually knows or willfully disregards is a minor may not:
(A) provide a consent mechanism that is designed to substantially subvert or impair or is
manipulated with the effect of substantially subverting or impairing user autonomy, decision-making, or choice;
or
(B) except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), offer a direct messaging apparatus for use by a
minor without providing readily accessible and easy-to-use safeguards to limit the ability of an adult to send
unsolicited communications to the minor with whom the adult is not connected.
(ii) Subsection (3)(b)(i)(B) does not apply to an online service, product, or feature of which the
predominant or exclusive function is:
(A) electronic mail; or
(B) direct messaging consisting of text, photos, or videos that are sent between devices by
electronic means in which messages are:
(I) shared between the sender and the recipient;
(II) only visible to the sender and the recipient; and
(III) not posted publicly.
(4) Subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b) do not apply to a service or application that is used by and under
the direction of an educational entity, including a learning management system or a student engagement
program.
Section 10. Responsibility according to role -- processing data of minors. (1) A processor shall
adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller to meet the controller's obligations under
[sections 9 and 11], taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to the
processor. The processor shall assist the controller by:
(a) taking appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the
fulfillment of the controller's obligations under [section 9]; and
(b) providing information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection

ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
assessments pursuant to [section 11].
(2) A contract between a controller and a processor must satisfy the requirements of 30-14-
2813(2).
(3) Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities
imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the controller's or processor's role in the processing
relationship as described in [sections 9 and 11].
(4) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific
processing of personal data is a fact-based determination that depends on the context in which personal data is
to be processed. A person that is not limited in the person's processing of personal data pursuant to a
controller's instructions or that fails to adhere to the instructions is a controller and not a processor with respect
to a specific processing of personal data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with
respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly
with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a
controller with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under 30-14-2817.
Section 11. Data protection assessments for heightened risk of harm to minors. (1) A controller
that, on or after October 1, 2025, offers an online service, product, or feature to a consumer whom the
controller actually knows or willfully disregards is a minor shall conduct a data protection assessment for the
online service, product, or feature if there is a heightened risk of harm to minors. The controller shall conduct
the data protection assessment:
(a) in a manner that is consistent with the requirements established in 30-14-2814; and
(b) to address:
(i) the purpose of the online service, product, or feature;
(ii) the categories of a minor's personal data that the online service, product, or feature processes;
(iii) the purposes for which the controller processes a minor's personal data with respect to the
online service, product, or feature; and
(iv) a heightened risk of harm to minors that is a reasonably foreseeable result of offering the
online service, product, or feature to minors.

ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 297
(2) A controller that conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to subsection (1) shall:
(a) review the data protection assessment as necessary to account for a material change to the
processing operations of the online service, product, or feature that is the subject of the data protection
assessment; and
(b) maintain documentation concerning the data protection assessment for the longer of:
(i) 3 years after the date on which the processing operations cease; or
(ii) the date the controller ceases offering the online service, product, or feature.
(3) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations
that include similar activities.
(4) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying with another
applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment is considered to satisfy the requirements
established in this section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data
protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
(5) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to subsection (1) or a data
protection assessment review pursuant to subsection (2)(a) and determines that the online service, product, or
feature that is the subject of the assessment poses a heightened risk of harm to minors, the controller shall
establish and implement a plan to mitigate or eliminate the heightened risk.
(6) (a) A data protection assessment conducted pursuant to this section:
(i) is confidential, except as provided in subsection (6)(b); and
(ii) is not a public record and is exempt from public inspection and copying under the Freedom of
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.
(b) (i) A controller shall make a data protection assessment conducted pursuant to this section
available to the attorney general on request. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection
assessment for compliance with this section and with other laws.
(ii) The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request from the attorney general
does not constitute a waiver of any attorney-client privilege or work-product protection that might otherwise
exist with respect to the assessment and any information in the assessment.
(7) Data protection assessment requirements apply to processing activities created or generated
