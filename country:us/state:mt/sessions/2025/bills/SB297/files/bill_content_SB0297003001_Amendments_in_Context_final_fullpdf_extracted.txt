1 (2) A consumer may exercise rights under this section by a secure and reliable means established
2 by the controller and described to the consumer in the controller's privacy notice.
3 (3) (a) A consumer may designate an authorized agent in accordance with 30-14-2809 to exercise
4 the rights of the consumer to opt out of the processing of the consumer's personal data under subsection (1)(e)
5 on behalf of the consumer.
6 (b) A parent or legal guardian of a known child may exercise the consumer rights on the known

11 (4) Except as otherwise provided in this part, a controller shall comply with a request by a
12 consumer to exercise the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this section as follows:
13 (a) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after
14 receipt of the request. The controller may extend the response period by 45 additional days when reasonably
15 necessary, considering the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, provided the controller informs
16 the consumer of the extension within the initial 45-day response period and the reason for the extension.
17 (b) If a controller declines to act regarding the consumer's request, the controller shall inform the
18 consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after receipt of the request, of the justification for
19 declining to act and provide instructions for how to appeal the decision.
20 (c) Information provided in response to a consumer request must be provided by a controller, free
21 of charge, once for each consumer during any 12-month period. If requests from a consumer are manifestly
22 unfounded, excessive, technically infeasible, or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a

1 be required to comply with a request to initiate an action pursuant to this section and shall provide notice to the
2 consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to exercise the right or rights until the
3 consumer provides additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the
4 consumer's request to exercise the consumer's rights. A controller may not be required to authenticate an opt-
5 out request, but a controller may deny an opt-out request if the controller has a good faith, reasonable, and
6 documented belief that the request is fraudulent. If a controller denies an opt-out request because the controller
7 believes the request is fraudulent, the controller shall send notice to the person who made the request
8 disclosing that the controller believes the request is fraudulent and that the controller may not comply with the
9 request.
10 (e) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the
11 consumer must be deemed in compliance with the consumer's request to delete the consumer's data pursuant
12 to subsection (1)(c) by:
13 (i) retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of
14 ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the controller's records and not using the retained

19 a request within a reasonable period after the consumer's receipt of the decision. The appeal process must be
20 conspicuously available and like the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section.
21 Not later than 60 days after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action
22 taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If
23 the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or
24 other method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to submit a complaint."
25 (6) In response to a consumer request under subsection (1)(a), a controller may not disclose the
26 following information about a consumer but shall inform the consumer instead with sufficient particularity that

14 volume and nature of the personal data at issue; and
15 (c) provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's consent under this
16 section that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's consent and,
17 on revocation of the consent, cease to process the personal data as soon as practicable, but not later than 45
18 days after the receipt of the request.
19 (2) A controller may not:

10 a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer,
11 including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised their right to opt out pursuant to

17 and conspicuous method outside the privacy notice for a consumer to opt out of the sale or processing. This
18 method may include but is not limited to an internet hyperlink clearly labeled "your opt-out rights" or "your
19 privacy rights" that directly effectuates the opt-out request or takes consumers to a web page where the
20 consumer can make the opt-out request.

22 privacy notice that includes:

2 controller; and
3 (f) an explanation of the rights provided by 30-14-2808(1) and how consumers may exercise their
4 consumer rights, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision regarding the consumer's
5 request. ; and
6 (g) the date the privacy notice was last updated.

8 controller provides a product or service that is subject to the privacy notice or carries out activities related to the
9 product or service.

1 (A)(i) whether the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not
2 exclusively accrue to the controller;
3 (B)(ii) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and

5 2813(2).
6 (3) Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities
7 imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the controller's or processor's role in the processing
8 relationship as described in [sections 9 and 11].
9 (4) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific
10 processing of personal data is a fact-based determination that depends on the context in which personal data is
11 to be processed. A person that is not limited in the person's processing of personal data pursuant to a
12 controller's instructions or that fails to adhere to the instructions is a controller and not a processor with respect
13 to a specific processing of personal data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with
14 respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly
15 with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a
16 controller with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under 30-14-2817.

7 assessment; and

9 (i) 3 years after the date on which the processing operations cease; or
10 (ii) the date the controller ceases offering the online service, product, or feature.

12 that include similar activities.

16 protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
17 (5) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to subsection (1) or a data
18 protection assessment review pursuant to subsection (2)(a) and determines that the online service, product, or
19 feature that is the subject of the assessment poses a heightened risk of harm to minors, the controller shall
20 establish and implement a plan to mitigate or eliminate the heightened risk.
21 (6) (a) A data protection assessment conducted pursuant to this section:
22 (i) is confidential, except as provided in subsection (6)(b); and
23 (ii) is not a public record and is exempt from public inspection and copying under the Freedom of
24 Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.

2 by the controller and described to the consumer in the controller's privacy notice.
3 (3) (a) A consumer may designate an authorized agent in accordance with 30-14-2809 to exercise

12 consumer to exercise the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this section as follows:
13 (a) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but not later than 45 days after
14 receipt of the request. The controller may extend the response period by 45 additional days when reasonably
15 necessary, considering the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, provided the controller informs

2 consumer that the controller is unable to authenticate the request to exercise the right or rights until the
3 consumer provides additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the
4 consumer's request to exercise the consumer's rights. A controller may not be required to authenticate an opt-
5 out request, but a controller may deny an opt-out request if the controller has a good faith, reasonable, and
6 documented belief that the request is fraudulent. If a controller denies an opt-out request because the controller
7 believes the request is fraudulent, the controller shall send notice to the person who made the request
8 disclosing that the controller believes the request is fraudulent and that the controller may not comply with the
9 request.
10 (e) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the
11 consumer must be deemed in compliance with the consumer's request to delete the consumer's data pursuant
12 to subsection (1)(c) by:
13 (i) retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of
14 ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the controller's records and not using the retained
15 data for any other purpose pursuant to the provisions of this part; or

17 except for those exempted pursuant to the provisions of this part.

21 Not later than 60 days after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action
22 taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If
23 the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or
24 other method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to submit a complaint."

13 security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data appropriate to the
14 volume and nature of the personal data at issue; and
15 (c) provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's consent under this
16 section that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's consent and,
17 on revocation of the consent, cease to process the personal data as soon as practicable, but not later than 45
18 days after the receipt of the request.
19 (2) A controller may not:

22 disclosed to the consumer unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent;

11 including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised their right to opt out pursuant to

6 (k) assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the obligations under this part; or
7 (l) process personal data for reasons of public interest in public health, community health, or
8 population health, but solely to the extent that the processing is:
9 (A)(i) subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the consumer whose
10 personal data is being processed; and
11 (B)(ii) under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations under federal,
12 state, or local law.
13 (2) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this part may not restrict a
14 controller's or processor's ability to collect, use, or retain personal data for internal use to:
15 (a) conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products, services, or technology;
16 (b) effectuate a product recall;
17 (c) identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or
18 (d) perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer
19 or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing relationship with the controller or are otherwise
20 compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by
21 a consumer or the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
22 (3) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this part may not apply when
23 compliance by the controller or processor with this part would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of
24 this state. Nothing in this part may be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal
25 data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state as part

1 accordance with this part may not be considered to have violated this part if the processor or third-party
2 controller that receives and processes the personal data violates this part provided, at the time the disclosing
3 controller or processor disclosed the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual
4 knowledge that the receiving processor or third-party controller would violate this part. A receiving processor or
5 third-party controller receiving personal data from a disclosing controller or processor in compliance with this
6 part is likewise not in violation of this part for the transgressions of the disclosing controller or processor from
7 which the receiving processor or third-party controller receives the personal data.
8 (5) Nothing in this part may be construed to:
9 (a) impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects the rights or freedoms

12 States constitution; or
13 (ii) under Rule 504 of the Montana Rules of Evidence; or or

15 activities. ; or
16 (c) require a controller or processor to implement an age verification or age-gating system or
17 otherwise affirmatively collect the age of consumers, but a controller that chooses to conduct commercially
18 reasonable age estimation to determine which consumers are minors is not liable for an erroneous age
19 estimation.
20 (6) Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be processed to the
21 extent that the processing is:
22 (a) reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
23 (b) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in
24 this section. The controller or processor must, when applicable, consider the nature and purpose of the
25 collection, use, or retention of the personal data collected, used, or retained pursuant to subsection (2). The
26 personal data must be subject to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the
27 confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of

2 (7) If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller
3 bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the
4 requirements in subsection (6).

2 (A) targeted advertising;
3 (B) the sale of personal data; or
4 (C) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning
5 a consumer;
6 (ii) for any processing purpose other than the processing purpose that the controller disclosed at
7 the time the controller collected the minor's personal data or that is reasonably necessary for and compatible

1 fulfillment of the controller's obligations under [section 9]; and
2 (b) providing information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection
3 assessments pursuant to [section 11].
4 (2) A contract between a controller and a processor must satisfy the requirements of 30-14-

8 relationship as described in [sections 9 and 11].
9 (4) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific
10 processing of personal data is a fact-based determination that depends on the context in which personal data is
11 to be processed. A person that is not limited in the person's processing of personal data pursuant to a
12 controller's instructions or that fails to adhere to the instructions is a controller and not a processor with respect
13 to a specific processing of personal data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with
14 respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly
15 with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a
16 controller with respect to the processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under 30-14-2817.

22 controller shall conduct the data protection assessment:
23 (a) in a manner that is consistent with the requirements established in 30-14-2814; and
24 (b) to address:
25 (i) the purpose of the online service, product, or feature;
26 (ii) the categories of a minor's personal data that the online service, product, or feature processes;
27 (iii) the purposes for which the controller processes a minor's personal data with respect to the

1 online service, product, or feature; and
2 (iv) a heightened risk of harm to minors that is a reasonably foreseeable result of offering the
3 online service, product, or feature to minors.

6 processing operations of the online service, product, or feature that is the subject of the data protection
7 assessment; and

9 (i) 3 years after the date on which the processing operations cease; or
10 (ii) the date the controller ceases offering the online service, product, or feature.
11 (3) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations
12 that include similar activities.
13 (4) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying with another

15 established in this section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data
16 protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
17 (5) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to subsection (1) or a data
18 protection assessment review pursuant to subsection (2)(a) and determines that the online service, product, or
19 feature that is the subject of the assessment poses a heightened risk of harm to minors, the controller shall
20 establish and implement a plan to mitigate or eliminate the heightened risk.
21 (6) (a) A data protection assessment conducted pursuant to this section:
22 (i) is confidential, except as provided in subsection (6)(b); and
23 (ii) is not a public record and is exempt from public inspection and copying under the Freedom of
24 Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.
25 (b) (i) A controller shall make a data protection assessment conducted pursuant to this section
26 available to the attorney general on request. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection
