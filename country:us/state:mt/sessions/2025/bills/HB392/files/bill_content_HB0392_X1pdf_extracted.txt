Section 1:
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 392
RELATED TO THE CREATION OF PROFITABLE FAMILY VIDEO CONTENT FEATURING MINOR
CHILDREN; PROVIDING FOR TRUST CONTRIBUTIONS OF PROFITS MADE FROM VIDEO CONTENT
FEATURING MINOR CHILDREN; PROVIDING A RIGHT TO REQUEST REMOVAL OF CONTENT;
PROVIDING A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION; AND PROVIDING DEFINITIONS.”
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:

Section 2:
Section 1. Short title. [Sections 1 through 7] may be cited as the "Child Digital Protection Act".

Section 3:
Section 2. Legislative findings and purpose. (1) The legislature finds that social media influencers
can make significant amounts of money from digital content. Some influencers use the influencers' minor
children as subjects of the content. The children featured in family-produced video content generate interest in
and revenue for the content but receive no financial compensation for participation. Unlike in child acting, the
children are not playing a part and lack legal protections in the state.
(2) The legislature further finds that social media influencers who market video content of the
influencers' families, or "content creators", can profit from the personal property rights of the influencers'
children without restriction. Some children are filmed from birth, with highly personal details of the children's
lives shared on the internet for compensation. In addition to severe loss of privacy, the children receive no
consideration for the use and exchange of the children's personal property rights.
(3) The purpose of [sections 1 through 7] is to allow minors to receive proportional compensation
for the use of specified personal property rights in which the minor's parent or parents have reached a specified
profit threshold from the use. Further, the purpose of [sections 1 through 7] is to provide for minors to exercise
control over specified personal property rights on reaching the age of majority.
