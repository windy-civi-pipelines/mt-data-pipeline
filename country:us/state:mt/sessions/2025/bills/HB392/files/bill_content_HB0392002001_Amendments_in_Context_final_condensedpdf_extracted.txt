11
12 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Short title. [Sections 1 through 7] may be cited as the "Child Digital
13 Protection Act".
14
15 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Legislative findings and purpose. (1) The legislature finds that social
16 media influencers can make significant amounts of money from digital content. Some influencers use the
17 influencers' minor children as subjects of the content. The children featured in family-produced video content
18 generate interest in and revenue for the content but receive no financial compensation for participation. Unlike
19 in child acting, the children are not playing a part and lack legal protections in the state.
20 (2) The legislature further finds that social media influencers who market video content of the
21 influencers' families, or "content creators", can profit from the personal property rights of the influencers'
22 children without restriction. Some children are filmed from birth, with highly personal details of the children's
23 lives shared on the internet for compensation. In addition to severe loss of privacy, the children receive no
24 consideration for the use and exchange of the children's personal property rights.
25 (3) The purpose of [sections 1 through 7] is to allow minors to receive proportional compensation
26 for the use of specified personal property rights in which the minor's parent or parents have reached a specified
27 profit threshold from the use. Further, the purpose of [sections 1 through 7] is to provide for minors to exercise
