of criminal offenses. :

convicted of criminal offenses; and
(b) the court finds, after a hearing and in writing, that it is in the interest of justice to hold the youth
in an adult jail or adult detention facility based on:
(i) the youth's:
(A) age;
(B) physical and mental maturity; and
(C) present mental state, including whether the youth presents an imminent risk of harm to the

detain a youth under the jurisdiction of district court in an adult jail or adult detention facility pending the final
disposition of the youth's case, the court must:
(a) hold a hearing at least once every 30 days to review whether it is still in the interest of justice to
require the youth to continue to be held in an area of a secure adult facility that provides sight and sound
separation from adults accused or convicted of criminal offenses;
(b) hold an additional hearing before the youth has been detained for 180 days to determine, in

youth's case if the youth is kept in an area that provides physical separation from adults accused or convicted
of criminal offenses. :
(a) the youth is kept in an area that provides sight and sound separation from adults accused or
convicted of criminal offenses; and
(b) the court finds, after a hearing and in writing, that it is in the interest of justice to hold the youth
in an adult jail or adult detention facility based on:
(i) the youth's:
(A) age;
(B) physical and mental maturity; and
(C) present mental state, including whether the youth presents an imminent risk of harm to the
youth's self or others;
(ii) the nature and circumstances of the alleged offense;

detain a youth under the jurisdiction of district court in an adult jail or adult detention facility pending the final
disposition of the youth's case, the court must:
(a) hold a hearing at least once every 30 days to review whether it is still in the interest of justice to
require the youth to continue to be held in an area of a secure adult facility that provides sight and sound
separation from adults accused or convicted of criminal offenses;
(b) hold an additional hearing before the youth has been detained for 180 days to determine, in
writing, if there is good cause for an extension unless the youth expressly waives this limitation."
