22 agencies shall incorporate the following procedures:

27 coursework so that graduation may occur on time.

13 article.

19 Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities. However, that person is not protected from suit or liability
20 for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the person's intentional or willful and wanton misconduct.
21 (6) The liability of the Interstate Commission's executive director and employees or Interstate
22 Commission representatives, acting within the scope of their employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions
23 occurring within their state, may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that
24 state for state officials, employees, and agents. The Interstate Commission is considered to be an
25 instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to
26 protect a person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the person's intentional or
27 willful and wanton misconduct.
28 (7) The Interstate Commission shall defend the executive director and its employees and, subject

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118.1
1 to the approval of the attorney general or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by
2 an Interstate Commission representative, shall defend the Interstate Commission representative in any civil
3 action seeking to impose liability arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within
4 the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities or that the defendant had a
5 reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or
6 responsibilities if the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton
7 misconduct on the part of the person.
8 (8) To the extent not covered by the state involved, the member state, the Interstate Commission,
9 or the representatives or employees of the Interstate Commission must be held harmless in the amount of a
10 settlement or judgment, including attorney fees and costs, obtained against those persons arising out of an
11 actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment,
12 duties, or responsibilities or that the persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of
13 Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities if the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did
14 not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of the persons.
15 ARTICLE XII
16 RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
17 (1) The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and
18 efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Interstate
19 Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this
20 compact or the powers granted under the compact, then such an action by the Interstate Commission is invalid
21 and has no force or effect.
22 (2) Rules must be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the Model
23 State Administrative Procedure Act revised as of 2012 as may be appropriate to the operations of the Interstate
24 Commission.
25 (3) Not later than 30 days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial
26 review of the rule. However, the filing of a petition does not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming
27 effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give
28 deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and may not find the rule
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118.1
1 to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the Interstate Commission's authority.
2 (4) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or
3 resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then the rule has no further force and effect in any
4 member state.
5 ARTICLE XIII
6 OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
7 (1) Each member state shall enforce this compact to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.
8 (2) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative
9 proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact that may affect the powers,
10 responsibilities, or actions of the Interstate Commission.
11 (3) The Interstate Commission is entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding
12 and has standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the
13 Interstate Commission renders a judgment or order void as to the Interstate Commission, this compact, or
14 promulgated rules.
15 (4) The purpose of this compact is not to supersede the sovereignty of any member state but
16 instead to facilitate the collective exercise of each state's sovereignty to allow a uniform solution without federal
17 intervention. No provision of the interstate compact may be construed as a waiver of a state's sovereignty.
18 (5) If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance
19 of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the Interstate
20 Commission shall:
21 (a) provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the
22 default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the Interstate Commission. The Interstate
23 Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state is required to cure its default.
24 (b) provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
25 (6) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state must be terminated from the
26 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges, and benefits
27 conferred by this compact must be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does
28 not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default, except that in
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118.1
1 the event of a default by this state, its total financial responsibility is limited to the amount of its most recent
2 annual assessment.
3 (7) Suspension or termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other
4 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by
5 the Interstate Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature,
6 and each of the member states.
7 (8) The state that has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments,
8 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination up to a maximum
9 amount of $5,000 multiplied by the number of years that the state has been a member of the compact. In the
10 event that this state is suspended or terminated, its total financial responsibility is limited to the amount of its
11 most recent annual assessment.
12 (9) The Interstate Commission may not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to
13 be in default or that has been suspended or terminated from the compact unless otherwise mutually agreed
14 upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.
15 (10) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the U.S.
16 district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal
17 offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
18 (11) The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve
19 disputes that are subject to the compact and that may arise among member states and between member and
20 nonmember states.
21 (12) The Interstate Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding
22 dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
23 ARTICLE XIV

25 (1) The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of
26 its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.

1 in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The
2 aggregate annual assessment amount must be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the
3 Interstate Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states to the limits as specified
4 herein.
5 (3) The annual assessment applicable to this state may not exceed an amount equal to $2 the per-
6 student amount determined by the Interstate Commission multiplied by the latest available number of children
7 of military families in this state.
8 (4) This state may not be held liable for the payment of any special assessment or other
9 assessment other than the annual assessment in the amount established by subsection (3).

11 adequate to meet those obligations, and the Interstate Commission may not pledge the credit of any of the
12 member states except by and with the authority of the member state.
13 (6) The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.
14 The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission are subject to the audit and accounting
15 procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the
16 Interstate Commission must be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the
17 audit must be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.
18 (7) All expenditures for the state, including withdrawal or dissolution costs, or both, may not
19 exceed an amount of $5,000 annually will be determined by the Interstate Commission.

19 (b) In compliance with the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.
20 794, and with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12131 through 12165, the
21 receiving state shall make reasonable accommodations and modifications to address the needs of incoming
22 students with disabilities, subject to an existing 504 or Title II plan, to provide the student with equal access to
23 education. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to
24 ensure appropriate placement of the student.
25 (4) Local education agency administrative officials have flexibility in waiving course or program
26 prerequisites or other preconditions for placement in courses or programs offered under the jurisdiction of the
27 local education agency.

14 standing in loco parentis who lives in a jurisdiction other than that of the custodial parent may continue to attend
15 the school in which the child was enrolled while residing with the custodial parent.
16 (4) State and local education agencies shall facilitate the opportunity for transitioning military
17 children's inclusion in extracurricular activities, regardless of application deadlines, to the extent they are
18 otherwise qualified.
19 ARTICLE VII
20 GRADUATION
21 In order to facilitate the on-time graduation of children of military families, states and local education
22 agencies shall incorporate the following procedures:
23 (1) Local education agency administrative officials shall waive specific courses required for
24 graduation if similar course work has been satisfactorily completed in another local education agency or shall
25 provide reasonable justification for denial. If a waiver is not granted to a student who would qualify to graduate
26 from the sending state, the local education agency shall provide an alternative means of acquiring required
27 coursework so that graduation may occur on time.
28 (2) (a) In lieu of testing requirements for graduation in the receiving state, states shall accept:

1 (i) exit or end-of-course exams required for graduation from the sending state;
2 (ii) national norm-referenced achievement tests; or
3 (iii) alternative testing.
4 (b) In the event that the above alternatives cannot be accommodated by the receiving state for a

6 apply.
7 (3) If a military student transferring at the beginning of or during the student's senior year is
8 ineligible to graduate from the receiving local education agency after all alternatives have been considered, the
9 sending and receiving local education agencies shall ensure the receipt of a diploma from the sending local
10 education agency if the student meets the graduation requirements of the sending local education agency. In
11 the event that one of the states in question is not a member of this compact, the member state shall use best
12 efforts to facilitate the on-time graduation of the student in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) of this
13 article.
14 ARTICLE VIII
15 STATE COORDINATION
16 (1) Each member state shall, through the creation of a state council or use of an existing body or
17 board, provide for the coordination among its agencies of government, local education agencies, and military
18 installations concerning the state's participation in and compliance with this compact and Interstate Commission
19 activities. While each member state may determine the membership of its own state council, its membership
20 must, at a minimum, include the state superintendent of public instruction, a superintendent of a school district
21 with a high concentration of military children, a representative from a military installation, one representative
22 each from the legislative and executive branches of government, and other offices and stakeholder groups that

13 member of the executive committee.
14 (6) The Interstate Commission shall establish bylaws and rules that provide for conditions and
15 procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records available to
16 the public for inspection or copying. The Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure information or

24 (c) disclose trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential;

8 documents considered in connection with an action must be identified in the minutes. All minutes and
9 documents of a closed meeting must remain under seal, subject to release by a majority vote of the Interstate
10 Commission.
11 (9) The Interstate Commission shall collect standardized data concerning the educational transition
12 of the children of military families under this compact as directed through its rules, which shall specify the data
13 to be collected, the means of collection, and data exchange and reporting requirements. The methods of data

15 and the Interstate Commission shall coordinate its information functions with the appropriate custodian of
16 records as identified in the bylaws and rules.

18 officials, and parents to inform the Interstate Commission if and when there are alleged violations of the
19 compact or its rules or when issues subject to the jurisdiction of the compact or its rules are not addressed by
20 the state or local education agency. This section may not be construed to create a private right of action against

69th Legislature 2025 HB 118.1
1 (3) The executive committee has authority and duties as set forth in the bylaws, including but not
2 limited to:
3 (a) managing the affairs of the Interstate Commission in a manner consistent with the bylaws and
4 purposes of the Interstate Commission;
5 (b) overseeing an organizational structure and appropriate procedures for the Interstate
6 Commission to provide for the creation of rules, operating procedures, and administrative and technical support
7 functions; and
8 (c) planning, implementing, and coordinating communications and activities with other state,
9 federal, and local government organizations in order to advance the goals of the Interstate Commission.
10 (4) The executive committee may, subject to the approval of the Interstate Commission, appoint or
11 retain an executive director for a period, upon terms and conditions, and for compensation as the Interstate

14 supervise other persons as authorized by the Interstate Commission.
15 (5) The Interstate Commission's executive director and its employees are immune from suit and

2 an Interstate Commission representative, shall defend the Interstate Commission representative in any civil
3 action seeking to impose liability arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within
4 the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities or that the defendant had a
5 reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or
6 responsibilities if the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton
7 misconduct on the part of the person.
8 (8) To the extent not covered by the state involved, the member state, the Interstate Commission,
9 or the representatives or employees of the Interstate Commission must be held harmless in the amount of a
10 settlement or judgment, including attorney fees and costs, obtained against those persons arising out of an
11 actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment,
12 duties, or responsibilities or that the persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of
13 Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities if the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did
14 not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of the persons.
15 ARTICLE XII
16 RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
17 (1) The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and
18 efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Interstate
19 Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this
20 compact or the powers granted under the compact, then such an action by the Interstate Commission is invalid
21 and has no force or effect.
22 (2) Rules must be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the Model
23 State Administrative Procedure Act revised as of 2012 as may be appropriate to the operations of the Interstate
24 Commission.
25 (3) Not later than 30 days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial
26 review of the rule. However, the filing of a petition does not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming
27 effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give
28 deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and may not find the rule
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118.1
1 to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the Interstate Commission's authority.
2 (4) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or
3 resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then the rule has no further force and effect in any
4 member state.
5 ARTICLE XIII
6 OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
7 (1) Each member state shall enforce this compact to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.
8 (2) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative
9 proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact that may affect the powers,
10 responsibilities, or actions of the Interstate Commission.
11 (3) The Interstate Commission is entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding
12 and has standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the
13 Interstate Commission renders a judgment or order void as to the Interstate Commission, this compact, or
14 promulgated rules.
15 (4) The purpose of this compact is not to supersede the sovereignty of any member state but
16 instead to facilitate the collective exercise of each state's sovereignty to allow a uniform solution without federal
17 intervention. No provision of the interstate compact may be construed as a waiver of a state's sovereignty.
18 (5) If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance
19 of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the Interstate
20 Commission shall:
21 (a) provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the
22 default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the Interstate Commission. The Interstate
23 Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state is required to cure its default.
24 (b) provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
25 (6) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state must be terminated from the
26 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges, and benefits
27 conferred by this compact must be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does
28 not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default, except that in
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118

69th Legislature 2025 HB 118.1
1 the event of a default by this state, its total financial responsibility is limited to the amount of its most recent
2 annual assessment.
3 (7) Suspension or termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other
4 means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by
5 the Interstate Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature,
6 and each of the member states.
7 (8) The state that has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments,
8 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination up to a maximum
9 amount of $5,000 multiplied by the number of years that the state has been a member of the compact. In the
10 event that this state is suspended or terminated, its total financial responsibility is limited to the amount of its
11 most recent annual assessment.
12 (9) The Interstate Commission may not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to
13 be in default or that has been suspended or terminated from the compact unless otherwise mutually agreed
14 upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.
15 (10) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the U.S.
16 district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal
17 offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
18 (11) The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve

26 its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118.1
1 in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The
2 aggregate annual assessment amount must be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the
3 Interstate Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states to the limits as specified
4 herein.
5 (3) The annual assessment applicable to this state may not exceed an amount equal to $2 the per-
6 student amount determined by the Interstate Commission multiplied by the latest available number of children
7 of military families in this state.
8 (4) This state may not be held liable for the payment of any special assessment or other
9 assessment other than the annual assessment in the amount established by subsection (3).
10 (5) The Interstate Commission may not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds
11 adequate to meet those obligations, and the Interstate Commission may not pledge the credit of any of the
12 member states except by and with the authority of the member state.
13 (6) The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.
14 The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission are subject to the audit and accounting
15 procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the

17 audit must be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.
18 (7) All expenditures for the state, including withdrawal or dissolution costs, or both, may not
19 exceed an amount of $5,000 annually will be determined by the Interstate Commission.
