ARTICLE IV
EDUCATIONAL RECORDS AND ENROLLMENT
(1) In the event that official education records cannot be released to the parents for the purpose of
transfer, the custodian of the records in the sending state shall prepare and furnish to the parent a complete set
of unofficial educational records from a local education facility, as defined by federal law, containing uniform

information provided in the unofficial records, pending validation by the official records, as quickly as possible.

the school in the receiving state within 10 days or within a time that is reasonably determined under the rules
promulgated by the Interstate Commission.

ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
initially honor placement of the student in educational courses based on the student's enrollment in the sending
state school, educational assessments conducted at the school in the sending state, or both, if the courses are
offered and space is available. Course placement includes but is not limited to honors, international
baccalaureate, advanced placement, and vocational, technical, and career pathways courses. Continuing the
student's academic program from the previous school and promoting placement in academically and career
challenging courses should be paramount when considering placement. This does not preclude the school in
the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement and continued
enrollment of the student in the courses.
(2) The receiving state school shall initially honor placement of the student in educational
programs based on space availability and current educational assessments conducted at the school in the
sending state or participation or placement in like programs in the sending state. Such programs include but are
not limited to gifted and talented programs. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from
performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student. This section does not
require a local education agency to create programs or offer services that were not in place prior to the
enrollment of the student unless the programs or services are required by federal or state law.
(3) (a) In compliance with the federal requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act, 20 U.S.C. 1400, et seq., the receiving state shall initially provide comparable services to a student with
disabilities based on the student's current individualized education program.
(b) In compliance with the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.
794, and with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12131 through 12165, the
receiving state shall make reasonable accommodations and modifications to address the needs of incoming
students with disabilities, subject to an existing 504 or Title II plan, to provide the student with equal access to
education. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to
ensure appropriate placement of the student.
(4) Local education agency administrative officials have flexibility in waiving course or program
prerequisites or other preconditions for placement in courses or programs offered under the jurisdiction of the
local education agency.
(5) A student whose parent or legal guardian is an active duty member of the uniformed services,
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
as defined by the compact, and has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or has immediately returned from
deployment to a combat zone or combat support posting must be granted additional excused absences at the
discretion of the local education agency superintendent to visit with the student's parent or legal guardian
relative to the leave or deployment of the parent or guardian.
ARTICLE VI
ELIGIBILITY
(1) A special power of attorney, relative to the guardianship of a child of a military family and
executed under applicable law, is sufficient for the purposes of enrollment and all other actions requiring
parental participation and consent.
(2) A local education agency is prohibited from charging local tuition to a transitioning military child
placed in the care of a noncustodial parent or other person standing in loco parentis who lives in a jurisdiction
other than that of the custodial parent.
(3) A transitioning military child, placed in the care of a noncustodial parent or other person
standing in loco parentis who lives in a jurisdiction other than that of the custodial parent may continue to attend
the school in which the child was enrolled while residing with the custodial parent.
(4) State and local education agencies shall facilitate the opportunity for transitioning military
children's inclusion in extracurricular activities, regardless of application deadlines, to the extent they are
otherwise qualified.
ARTICLE VII
GRADUATION
In order to facilitate the on-time graduation of children of military families, states and local education
agencies shall incorporate the following procedures:
(1) Local education agency administrative officials shall waive specific courses required for
graduation if similar course work has been satisfactorily completed in another local education agency or shall
provide reasonable justification for denial. If a waiver is not granted to a student who would qualify to graduate
from the sending state, the local education agency shall provide an alternative means of acquiring required
coursework so that graduation may occur on time.
(2) (a) In lieu of testing requirements for graduation in the receiving state, states shall accept:
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
(i) exit or end-of-course exams required for graduation from the sending state;
(ii) national norm-referenced achievement tests; or
(iii) alternative testing.
(b) In the event that the above alternatives cannot be accommodated by the receiving state for a
student transferring to the school during the student's senior year, the provisions of subsection (3) of this article
apply.
(3) If a military student transferring at the beginning of or during the student's senior year is
ineligible to graduate from the receiving local education agency after all alternatives have been considered, the
sending and receiving local education agencies shall ensure the receipt of a diploma from the sending local
education agency if the student meets the graduation requirements of the sending local education agency. In
the event that one of the states in question is not a member of this compact, the member state shall use best
efforts to facilitate the on-time graduation of the student in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) of this
article.
ARTICLE VIII
STATE COORDINATION
(1) Each member state shall, through the creation of a state council or use of an existing body or
board, provide for the coordination among its agencies of government, local education agencies, and military
installations concerning the state's participation in and compliance with this compact and Interstate Commission
activities. While each member state may determine the membership of its own state council, its membership
must, at a minimum, include the state superintendent of public instruction, a superintendent of a school district
with a high concentration of military children, a representative from a military installation, one representative
each from the legislative and executive branches of government, and other offices and stakeholder groups that
the state council considers appropriate.
(2) The state council of each member state shall appoint or designate a military family education
liaison to assist military families and the state in facilitating the implementation of this compact.
(3) The compact commissioner responsible for the administration and management of the state's
participation in the compact must be appointed by the governor or as otherwise determined by each member
state.

The member states hereby create the Interstate Commission on Educational Opportunity for Military
Children. The activities of the Interstate Commission are the formation of public policy and are a discretionary
state function.
(1) The Interstate Commission is a body corporate and joint agency of the member states and has
all the responsibilities, powers, and duties set forth herein and additional powers that may be conferred upon it
by a subsequent concurrent action of the respective legislatures of the member states in accordance with the
terms of this compact.

who is that state's compact commissioner.

vote.

council may delegate voting authority to another person from the state for a specified meeting.
(e) The bylaws may provide for meetings of the Interstate Commission to be conducted by
telecommunication or electronic communication.
(3) The Interstate Commission consists of ex-officio, nonvoting representatives who are members
of interested organizations. The ex-officio members, as defined in the bylaws, may include but may not be
limited to members of the representative organizations of military family advocates, local education agency
officials, parent and teacher groups, the U.S. department of defense, the education commission of the states,

the Interstate Commission, with the exception of rulemaking, during periods when the Interstate Commission is
not in session. The executive committee shall oversee the day-to-day activities of the administration of the
compact, including enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the compact and its bylaws and rules
and other duties considered necessary. The U.S. department of defense shall serve as an ex-officio, nonvoting
member of the executive committee.
(6) The Interstate Commission shall establish bylaws and rules that provide for conditions and
procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records available to
the public for inspection or copying. The Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure information or
official records to the extent they would adversely affect personal privacy rights or proprietary interests.
(7) Public notice must be given by the Interstate Commission of all meetings, and all meetings
must be open to the public except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact. The

documents considered in connection with an action must be identified in the minutes. All minutes and
documents of a closed meeting must remain under seal, subject to release by a majority vote of the Interstate
Commission.
(9) The Interstate Commission shall collect standardized data concerning the educational transition
of the children of military families under this compact as directed through its rules, which shall specify the data
to be collected, the means of collection, and data exchange and reporting requirements. The methods of data
collection, exchange, and reporting must, in so far as is reasonably possible, conform to current technology,
and the Interstate Commission shall coordinate its information functions with the appropriate custodian of
records as identified in the bylaws and rules.
(10) The Interstate Commission shall create a process that permits military officials, education
officials, and parents to inform the Interstate Commission if and when there are alleged violations of the
compact or its rules or when issues subject to the jurisdiction of the compact or its rules are not addressed by
the state or local education agency. This section may not be construed to create a private right of action against
the Interstate Commission, any member state, or any local education agency.

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
(3) The executive committee has authority and duties as set forth in the bylaws, including but not
limited to:
(a) managing the affairs of the Interstate Commission in a manner consistent with the bylaws and
purposes of the Interstate Commission;
(b) overseeing an organizational structure and appropriate procedures for the Interstate
Commission to provide for the creation of rules, operating procedures, and administrative and technical support
functions; and
(c) planning, implementing, and coordinating communications and activities with other state,

supervise other persons as authorized by the Interstate Commission.
(5) The Interstate Commission's executive director and its employees are immune from suit and

responsibilities if the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton
misconduct on the part of the person.
(8) To the extent not covered by the state involved, the member state, the Interstate Commission,
or the representatives or employees of the Interstate Commission must be held harmless in the amount of a
settlement or judgment, including attorney fees and costs, obtained against those persons arising out of an
actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment,
duties, or responsibilities or that the persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of
Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities if the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did
not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of the persons.
ARTICLE XII
RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
(1) The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and
efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Interstate
Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this

State Administrative Procedure Act revised as of 2012 as may be appropriate to the operations of the Interstate
Commission.
(3) Not later than 30 days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial
review of the rule. However, the filing of a petition does not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming
effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give
deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and may not find the rule
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the Interstate Commission's authority.
(4) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or
resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then the rule has no further force and effect in any
member state.
ARTICLE XIII
OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
(1) Each member state shall enforce this compact to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.
(2) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative
proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact that may affect the powers,
responsibilities, or actions of the Interstate Commission.
(3) The Interstate Commission is entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding
and has standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the
Interstate Commission renders a judgment or order void as to the Interstate Commission, this compact, or
promulgated rules.
(4) The purpose of this compact is not to supersede the sovereignty of any member state but
instead to facilitate the collective exercise of each state's sovereignty to allow a uniform solution without federal
intervention. No provision of the interstate compact may be construed as a waiver of a state's sovereignty.
(5) If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance
of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the Interstate
Commission shall:
(a) provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the
default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the Interstate Commission. The Interstate
Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state is required to cure its default.
(b) provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
(6) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state must be terminated from the
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges, and benefits
conferred by this compact must be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does
not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default, except that in
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
the event of a default by this state, its total financial responsibility is limited to the amount of its most recent
annual assessment.
(7) Suspension or termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other
means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by
the Interstate Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature,
and each of the member states.
(8) The state that has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments,
obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination up to a maximum
amount of $5,000 multiplied by the number of years that the state has been a member of the compact. In the
event that this state is suspended or terminated, its total financial responsibility is limited to the amount of its
most recent annual assessment.
(9) The Interstate Commission may not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to
be in default or that has been suspended or terminated from the compact unless otherwise mutually agreed
upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.
(10) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the U.S.
district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal
offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(11) The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve
disputes that are subject to the compact and that may arise among member states and between member and
nonmember states.
(12) The Interstate Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding
dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
ARTICLE XIV
FINANCING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
(1) The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of
its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.
(2) The Interstate Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member
state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff, which must be

ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The
aggregate annual assessment amount must be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the
Interstate Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states to the limits as specified
herein.
(3) The annual assessment applicable to this state may not exceed an amount equal to the per-
student amount determined by the Interstate Commission multiplied by the latest available number of children
of military families in this state.
(4) This state may not be held liable for the payment of any special assessment or other
assessment other than the annual assessment in the amount established by subsection (3).
(5) The Interstate Commission may not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds
adequate to meet those obligations, and the Interstate Commission may not pledge the credit of any of the
member states except by and with the authority of the member state.
(6) The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.
The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission are subject to the audit and accounting
procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the
Interstate Commission must be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the
audit must be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.
(7) All expenditures for the state, including withdrawal or dissolution costs, or both, will be
determined by the Interstate Commission.

writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state, except that if this
state elects to withdraw from the compact by statutorily allowing for the expiration of this section, this state shall
notify the chairperson of the commission when it becomes evident that the expiration will take effect. The
Interstate Commission shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within
60 days of its receipt of the notice.

ARTICLE IV

(1) In the event that official education records cannot be released to the parents for the purpose of

ENROLLED BILL

initially honor placement of the student in educational courses based on the student's enrollment in the sending
state school, educational assessments conducted at the school in the sending state, or both, if the courses are
offered and space is available. Course placement includes but is not limited to honors, international
baccalaureate, advanced placement, and vocational, technical, and career pathways courses. Continuing the
student's academic program from the previous school and promoting placement in academically and career
challenging courses should be paramount when considering placement. This does not preclude the school in
the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement and continued
enrollment of the student in the courses.
(2) The receiving state school shall initially honor placement of the student in educational
programs based on space availability and current educational assessments conducted at the school in the
sending state or participation or placement in like programs in the sending state. Such programs include but are
not limited to gifted and talented programs. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from
performing subsequent evaluations to ensure appropriate placement of the student. This section does not
require a local education agency to create programs or offer services that were not in place prior to the
enrollment of the student unless the programs or services are required by federal or state law.
(3) (a) In compliance with the federal requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act, 20 U.S.C. 1400, et seq., the receiving state shall initially provide comparable services to a student with
disabilities based on the student's current individualized education program.
(b) In compliance with the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.
794, and with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. 12131 through 12165, the
receiving state shall make reasonable accommodations and modifications to address the needs of incoming
students with disabilities, subject to an existing 504 or Title II plan, to provide the student with equal access to
education. This does not preclude the school in the receiving state from performing subsequent evaluations to
ensure appropriate placement of the student.
(4) Local education agency administrative officials have flexibility in waiving course or program
prerequisites or other preconditions for placement in courses or programs offered under the jurisdiction of the
local education agency.
(5) A student whose parent or legal guardian is an active duty member of the uniformed services,
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
as defined by the compact, and has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or has immediately returned from
deployment to a combat zone or combat support posting must be granted additional excused absences at the
discretion of the local education agency superintendent to visit with the student's parent or legal guardian
relative to the leave or deployment of the parent or guardian.
ARTICLE VI
ELIGIBILITY
(1) A special power of attorney, relative to the guardianship of a child of a military family and
executed under applicable law, is sufficient for the purposes of enrollment and all other actions requiring
parental participation and consent.
(2) A local education agency is prohibited from charging local tuition to a transitioning military child
placed in the care of a noncustodial parent or other person standing in loco parentis who lives in a jurisdiction
other than that of the custodial parent.
(3) A transitioning military child, placed in the care of a noncustodial parent or other person
standing in loco parentis who lives in a jurisdiction other than that of the custodial parent may continue to attend
the school in which the child was enrolled while residing with the custodial parent.
(4) State and local education agencies shall facilitate the opportunity for transitioning military
children's inclusion in extracurricular activities, regardless of application deadlines, to the extent they are
otherwise qualified.
ARTICLE VII
GRADUATION
In order to facilitate the on-time graduation of children of military families, states and local education
agencies shall incorporate the following procedures:
(1) Local education agency administrative officials shall waive specific courses required for
graduation if similar course work has been satisfactorily completed in another local education agency or shall
provide reasonable justification for denial. If a waiver is not granted to a student who would qualify to graduate
from the sending state, the local education agency shall provide an alternative means of acquiring required
coursework so that graduation may occur on time.
(2) (a) In lieu of testing requirements for graduation in the receiving state, states shall accept:
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
(i) exit or end-of-course exams required for graduation from the sending state;
(ii) national norm-referenced achievement tests; or
(iii) alternative testing.
(b) In the event that the above alternatives cannot be accommodated by the receiving state for a
student transferring to the school during the student's senior year, the provisions of subsection (3) of this article
apply.
(3) If a military student transferring at the beginning of or during the student's senior year is
ineligible to graduate from the receiving local education agency after all alternatives have been considered, the
sending and receiving local education agencies shall ensure the receipt of a diploma from the sending local
education agency if the student meets the graduation requirements of the sending local education agency. In
the event that one of the states in question is not a member of this compact, the member state shall use best
efforts to facilitate the on-time graduation of the student in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) of this
article.
ARTICLE VIII
STATE COORDINATION
(1) Each member state shall, through the creation of a state council or use of an existing body or
board, provide for the coordination among its agencies of government, local education agencies, and military
installations concerning the state's participation in and compliance with this compact and Interstate Commission
activities. While each member state may determine the membership of its own state council, its membership
must, at a minimum, include the state superintendent of public instruction, a superintendent of a school district
with a high concentration of military children, a representative from a military installation, one representative
each from the legislative and executive branches of government, and other offices and stakeholder groups that
the state council considers appropriate.
(2) The state council of each member state shall appoint or designate a military family education
liaison to assist military families and the state in facilitating the implementation of this compact.
(3) The compact commissioner responsible for the administration and management of the state's
participation in the compact must be appointed by the governor or as otherwise determined by each member

(6) The Interstate Commission shall establish bylaws and rules that provide for conditions and
procedures under which the Interstate Commission shall make its information and official records available to
the public for inspection or copying. The Interstate Commission may exempt from disclosure information or
official records to the extent they would adversely affect personal privacy rights or proprietary interests.
(7) Public notice must be given by the Interstate Commission of all meetings, and all meetings
must be open to the public except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact. The
Interstate Commission and its committees may close a meeting or portion thereof if it determines by a two-

(a) relate solely to the Interstate Commission's internal personnel;
(b) disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by federal and state statute;
(c) disclose trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential;
(d) involve accusing a person of a crime or formally censuring a person;

(8) For a meeting or portion of a meeting closed pursuant to this provision, the Interstate
Commission's legal counsel or designee shall certify that the meeting may be closed and shall reference each
relevant exemptible provision. The Interstate Commission shall keep minutes, which shall fully and clearly
describe all matters discussed in a meeting, and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken and
the reasons therefore, including a description of the views expressed and the record of a roll call vote. All
documents considered in connection with an action must be identified in the minutes. All minutes and
documents of a closed meeting must remain under seal, subject to release by a majority vote of the Interstate
Commission.
(9) The Interstate Commission shall collect standardized data concerning the educational transition
of the children of military families under this compact as directed through its rules, which shall specify the data
to be collected, the means of collection, and data exchange and reporting requirements. The methods of data
collection, exchange, and reporting must, in so far as is reasonably possible, conform to current technology,
and the Interstate Commission shall coordinate its information functions with the appropriate custodian of
records as identified in the bylaws and rules.
(10) The Interstate Commission shall create a process that permits military officials, education
officials, and parents to inform the Interstate Commission if and when there are alleged violations of the
compact or its rules or when issues subject to the jurisdiction of the compact or its rules are not addressed by
the state or local education agency. This section may not be construed to create a private right of action against
the Interstate Commission, any member state, or any local education agency.

(1) The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of the members present and voting, within 12
months after the first Interstate Commission meeting, adopt bylaws to govern its conduct as may be necessary
or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the compact, including but not limited to:
(a) establishing the fiscal year of the Interstate Commission;
(b) establishing an executive committee and other committees as may be necessary;
(c) providing for the establishment of committees and for governing any general or specific

shall preside at all meetings of the Interstate Commission. The officers shall serve without compensation or

- 13 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
(3) The executive committee has authority and duties as set forth in the bylaws, including but not
limited to:
(a) managing the affairs of the Interstate Commission in a manner consistent with the bylaws and
purposes of the Interstate Commission;
(b) overseeing an organizational structure and appropriate procedures for the Interstate
Commission to provide for the creation of rules, operating procedures, and administrative and technical support
functions; and
(c) planning, implementing, and coordinating communications and activities with other state,
federal, and local government organizations in order to advance the goals of the Interstate Commission.
(4) The executive committee may, subject to the approval of the Interstate Commission, appoint or
retain an executive director for a period, upon terms and conditions, and for compensation as the Interstate
Commission considers appropriate. The executive director shall serve as secretary to the Interstate
Commission, but may not be a member of the Interstate Commission. The executive director shall hire and
supervise other persons as authorized by the Interstate Commission.
(5) The Interstate Commission's executive director and its employees are immune from suit and
liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for a claim for damage to or loss of property or personal
injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that
occurred or that the person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate
Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities. However, that person is not protected from suit or liability
for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the person's intentional or willful and wanton misconduct.
(6) The liability of the Interstate Commission's executive director and employees or Interstate
Commission representatives, acting within the scope of their employment or duties for acts, errors, or omissions
occurring within their state, may not exceed the limits of liability set forth under the constitution and laws of that
state for state officials, employees, and agents. The Interstate Commission is considered to be an
instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this subsection may be construed to
protect a person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the person's intentional or
willful and wanton misconduct.
(7) The Interstate Commission shall defend the executive director and its employees and, subject
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
to the approval of the attorney general or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by
an Interstate Commission representative, shall defend the Interstate Commission representative in any civil
action seeking to impose liability arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within
the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities or that the defendant had a
reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or
responsibilities if the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton
misconduct on the part of the person.
(8) To the extent not covered by the state involved, the member state, the Interstate Commission,
or the representatives or employees of the Interstate Commission must be held harmless in the amount of a
settlement or judgment, including attorney fees and costs, obtained against those persons arising out of an
actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment,
duties, or responsibilities or that the persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of
Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities if the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did
not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of the persons.
ARTICLE XII
RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
(1) The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and
efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Interstate
Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this
compact or the powers granted under the compact, then such an action by the Interstate Commission is invalid
and has no force or effect.
(2) Rules must be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the Model
State Administrative Procedure Act revised as of 2012 as may be appropriate to the operations of the Interstate
Commission.
(3) Not later than 30 days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial
review of the rule. However, the filing of a petition does not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming
effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give
deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and may not find the rule
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the Interstate Commission's authority.
(4) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or
resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then the rule has no further force and effect in any
member state.
ARTICLE XIII
OVERSIGHT, ENFORCEMENT, AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
(1) Each member state shall enforce this compact to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.
(2) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative
proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact that may affect the powers,
responsibilities, or actions of the Interstate Commission.
(3) The Interstate Commission is entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding
and has standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the
Interstate Commission renders a judgment or order void as to the Interstate Commission, this compact, or
promulgated rules.
(4) The purpose of this compact is not to supersede the sovereignty of any member state but
instead to facilitate the collective exercise of each state's sovereignty to allow a uniform solution without federal
intervention. No provision of the interstate compact may be construed as a waiver of a state's sovereignty.
(5) If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance
of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the Interstate
Commission shall:
(a) provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the
default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the Interstate Commission. The Interstate
Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state is required to cure its default.
(b) provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
(6) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state must be terminated from the
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges, and benefits
conferred by this compact must be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does
not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default, except that in
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 118
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
the event of a default by this state, its total financial responsibility is limited to the amount of its most recent
annual assessment.
(7) Suspension or termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other
means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by
the Interstate Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature,
and each of the member states.
(8) The state that has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments,
obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination up to a maximum
amount of $5,000 multiplied by the number of years that the state has been a member of the compact. In the
event that this state is suspended or terminated, its total financial responsibility is limited to the amount of its
most recent annual assessment.
(9) The Interstate Commission may not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to
be in default or that has been suspended or terminated from the compact unless otherwise mutually agreed
upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.
(10) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the U.S.
district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal
offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(11) The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve
disputes that are subject to the compact and that may arise among member states and between member and
nonmember states.
(12) The Interstate Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding
dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
ARTICLE XIV
FINANCING OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
(1) The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of
its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.
(2) The Interstate Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member
state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff, which must be

ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 118
in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The
aggregate annual assessment amount must be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the
Interstate Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states to the limits as specified
herein.
(3) The annual assessment applicable to this state may not exceed an amount equal to the per-
student amount determined by the Interstate Commission multiplied by the latest available number of children
of military families in this state.
(4) This state may not be held liable for the payment of any special assessment or other
assessment other than the annual assessment in the amount established by subsection (3).
(5) The Interstate Commission may not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds
adequate to meet those obligations, and the Interstate Commission may not pledge the credit of any of the
member states except by and with the authority of the member state.
(6) The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.
The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission are subject to the audit and accounting
procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the
Interstate Commission must be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the
audit must be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.
(7) All expenditures for the state, including withdrawal or dissolution costs, or both, will be
determined by the Interstate Commission.

be accomplished by statutorily allowing for expiration of this section.
(2) Withdrawal from this compact must be by the enactment of legislation repealing the compact

(3) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in
writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state, except that if this
state elects to withdraw from the compact by statutorily allowing for the expiration of this section, this state shall
notify the chairperson of the commission when it becomes evident that the expiration will take effect. The
Interstate Commission shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within
60 days of its receipt of the notice.
(4) The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred
through the effective date of withdrawal up to a maximum amount equal to the per-student amount determined

state.
