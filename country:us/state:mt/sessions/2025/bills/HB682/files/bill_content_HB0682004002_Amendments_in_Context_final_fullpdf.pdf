5 the services listed in subsections (3) and (4) to persons qualifying for medicaid under the medically needy
6 category of assistance.
7 (6) In accordance with federal law or waivers of federal law that are granted by the secretary of the
8 U.S. department of health and human services, the department may implement limited medicaid benefits, to be

11 medical assistance only who are covered under a group related to a program providing cash assistance, as
12 defined in 53-4-201. Basic medicaid benefits consist of all mandatory services listed in subsection (3) but may
13 include those optional services listed in subsections (4)(a) through (4)(s) that the department in its discretion
14 specifies by rule. The department, in exercising its discretion, may consider the amount of funds appropriated
15 by the legislature, whether approval has been received, as provided in 53-1-612, and whether the provision of a
16 particular service is commonly covered by private health insurance plans. However, a recipient who is
17 pregnant, meets the criteria for disability provided in Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 416, et seq., or
18 is less than 21 years of age is entitled to full medicaid coverage.

20 U.S.C. 1396, et seq., as may be amended, a program under medicaid for payment of medicare premiums,
21 deductibles, and coinsurance for persons not otherwise eligible for medicaid.
22 (8) (a) The department may set rates for medical and other services provided to recipients of
23 medicaid and may enter into contracts for delivery of services to individual recipients or groups of recipients.

4 from Montana medicaid for services provided to individuals of different ages, diagnoses, and treatments.
5 (9) The services provided under this part may be only those that are medically necessary and that
6 are the most efficient and cost-effective.
7 (10) (a) The amount, scope, and duration of services provided under this part must be determined
8 by the department in accordance with Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1396, et seq., as may be
9 amended.
10 (b) The department shall, with reasonable promptness, provide access to all medically necessary
11 services prescribed under the early and periodic screening, diagnosis, and treatment benefit, including access
12 to prescription drugs and durable medical equipment for which the department has not negotiated a rebate.
13 (11) Services, procedures, and items of an experimental or cosmetic nature may not be provided.
14 (12) (a) Prior to enacting changes to provider rates, medicaid waivers, or the medicaid state plan,
15 the department shall report this information to the following committees:
16 (i) the children, families, health, and human services interim committee;
17 (ii) the legislative finance committee; and
18 (iii) the health and human services budget committee.
19 (b) In its report to the committees, the department shall provide an explanation for the proposed
20 changes and an estimated budget impact to the department over the next 4 fiscal years.
21 (13) If available funds are not sufficient to provide medical assistance for all eligible persons, the
22 department may set priorities to limit, reduce, or otherwise curtail the amount, scope, or duration of the medical
23 services made available under the Montana medicaid program after taking into consideration the funding
24 principles set forth in subsection (2).
25 (14) If services provided under the Montana medicaid program include gender transition treatment
26 or subsequent treatment directly related to the provision of gender transition treatment, services provided under
27 the program must also include detransition treatment under equivalent cost-sharing policies.
