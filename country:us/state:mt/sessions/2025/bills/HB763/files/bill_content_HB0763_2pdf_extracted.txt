20 (2) The department may also develop and administer alternative programs to the block
21 management program that are designed to promote public access to private and public lands for hunting
22 purposes.
23 (3) Participation in a hunting access program established under this section is voluntary. A lease,
24 acquisition, or other arrangement for public access to or across private property for hunting purposes must be
25 negotiated through a cooperative agreement between the landowner and the department that will guarantee

9 affected landowners must be consulted. An affected landowner's management goals and personal observations
10 regarding game populations and habitat use must be considered in development of the agreement.
11 (6) The commission may adopt rules to implement the provisions of this section, including but not
12 limited to rules that determine tangible benefits to be provided to a landowner who participates in a hunting
13 access program. Benefits are intended to offset potential impacts associated with public hunting access,
