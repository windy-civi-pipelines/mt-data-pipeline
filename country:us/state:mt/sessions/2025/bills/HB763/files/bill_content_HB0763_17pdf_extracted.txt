16 "87-1-265. Hunting access programs -- block management program -- private landowner

21 management program that are designed to promote public access to private and public lands for hunting
22 purposes.
23 (3) Participation in a hunting access program established under this section is voluntary. A lease,
24 acquisition, or other arrangement for public access to or across private property for hunting purposes must be

69th Legislature 2025 HB 763.1
1 (a) hunting access management;
2 (b) services to be provided to the public;
3 (c) ranch rules and other restrictions; and
4 (d) any other management information to be gathered, which must be made available to the public.
5 (4) Private land is not eligible for inclusion in a hunting access program if outfitting, commercial
6 hunting, or fees charged for private hunting access unreasonably restrict public hunting opportunities.
7 (5) If the department determines that an agreement may adversely influence game management
8 decisions or wildlife habitat on public lands, then other public land agencies, interested sportspersons, and
9 affected landowners must be consulted. An affected landowner's management goals and personal observations
10 regarding game populations and habitat use must be considered in development of the agreement.
11 (6) The commission may adopt rules to implement the provisions of this section, including but not
12 limited to rules that determine tangible benefits to be provided to a landowner who participates in a hunting
13 access program. Benefits are intended to offset potential impacts associated with public hunting access,
14 including but not limited to those associated with general ranch maintenance, conservation efforts, weed
15 control, fire protection, liability insurance, roads, fences, and parking area maintenance. Factors used in
16 determining benefits may include but are not limited to:
17 (a) the number of days of public hunting provided by a participating landowner;
18 (b) wildlife habitat provided;
19 (c) resident game populations;
20 (d) number, sex, and species of animals taken; and
21 (e) access provided to adjacent public lands.

24 (a) exempt the access agreement from tracking the number of days of public hunting access
25 provided by a participating landowner;
26 (b) agree to a payment to the landowner that is a flat fee rate and not based on the number of
27 days of public hunting access provided by a participating landowner;
28 (c) use the amount and opportunity provided by public lands access as factors to determine

9 (iii) to offset insurance costs incurred for allowing public hunting access.
10 (c) The department may provide assistance in the construction and maintenance of roads, gates,
11 and parking facilities and in the signing of property.
12 (8) (9) (a) Except as provided in 87-1-264 and subsection (8) (b) (9)(b) of this section, payments to a
13 landowner who participates in a hunting access program through an annual agreement may not exceed
