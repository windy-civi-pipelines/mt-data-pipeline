5 MANAGEMENT PROGRAM; ALLOWING THE FISH AND WILDLIFE COMMISSION TO ADOPT SIMPLIFIED

10
11 Section 1. Section 87-1-265, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "87-1-265. Hunting access programs -- block management program -- private landowner
13 assistance -- rules -- restriction on landowner liability. (1) There is established a block management
14 program administered by the department to provide landowner assistance that encourages public access to
15 private and public lands for hunting purposes.
16 (2) The department may also develop and administer alternative programs to the block
17 management program that are designed to promote public access to private and public lands for hunting
18 purposes.
19 (3) Participation in a hunting access program established under this section is voluntary. A lease,
20 acquisition, or other arrangement for public access to or across private property for hunting purposes must be
21 negotiated through a cooperative agreement between the landowner and the department that will guarantee
22 reasonable access for public hunting. Landowners may also form a voluntary association when development of
23 a unified cooperative agreement is advantageous. A cooperative agreement must contain a detailed description
24 of the conditions for use of the private property, including but not limited to:
25 (a) hunting access management;
26 (b) services to be provided to the public;
27 (c) ranch rules and other restrictions; and
28 (d) any other management information to be gathered, which must be made available to the public.

1 (4) Private land is not eligible for inclusion in a hunting access program if outfitting, commercial
2 hunting, or fees charged for private hunting access unreasonably restrict public hunting opportunities.
3 (5) If the department determines that an agreement may adversely influence game management
4 decisions or wildlife habitat on public lands, then other public land agencies, interested sportspersons, and
5 affected landowners must be consulted. An affected landowner's management goals and personal observations
6 regarding game populations and habitat use must be considered in development of the agreement.
7 (6) The commission may adopt rules to implement the provisions of this section, including but not
8 limited to rules that determine tangible benefits to be provided to a landowner who participates in a hunting
9 access program. Benefits are intended to offset potential impacts associated with public hunting access,
10 including but not limited to those associated with general ranch maintenance, conservation efforts, weed
11 control, fire protection, liability insurance, roads, fences, and parking area maintenance. Factors used in
12 determining benefits may include but are not limited to:
13 (a) the number of days of public hunting provided by a participating landowner;
14 (b) wildlife habitat provided;
15 (c) resident game populations;
16 (d) number, sex, and species of animals taken; and
17 (e) access provided to adjacent public lands.
18 (7) For agreements that only provide access to adjacent public lands for hunting purposes, the
19 commission may;
20 (a) exempt the access agreement from tracking the number of days of public hunting access
21 provided by a participating landowner;
22 (b) agree to a payment to the landowner that is a flat fee rate and not based on the number of
23 days of public hunting access provided by a participating landowner;
24 (c) use the amount and opportunity provided by public lands access as factors to determine
25 benefits; and
26 (d) otherwise implement simplified rules.
27 (7) (8) (a) Benefits earned by a landowner who participates in a hunting access program may include
28 but are not limited to those applied in the manner described in subsections (7) (b) (8)(b) and (7) (c) (8)(c).
