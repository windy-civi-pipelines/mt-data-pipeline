15 Section 1. Section 87-1-265, MCA, is amended to read:
16 "87-1-265. Hunting access programs -- block management program -- private landowner

18 program administered by the department to provide landowner assistance that encourages public access to
19 private and public lands for hunting purposes.

21 management program that are designed to promote public access to private and public lands for hunting
22 purposes.

8 (5) If the department determines that an agreement may adversely influence game management
9 decisions or wildlife habitat on public lands, then other public land agencies, interested sportspersons, and
10 affected landowners must be consulted. An affected landowner's management goals and personal observations
11 regarding game populations and habitat use must be considered in development of the agreement.
12 (6) The commission may adopt rules to implement the provisions of this section, including but not
13 limited to rules that determine tangible benefits to be provided to a landowner who participates in a hunting
14 access program. Benefits are intended to offset potential impacts associated with public hunting access,
15 including but not limited to those associated with general ranch maintenance, conservation efforts, weed
16 control, fire protection, liability insurance, roads, fences, and parking area maintenance. Factors used in
17 determining benefits may include but are not limited to:
18 (a) the number of days of public hunting provided by a participating landowner;
19 (b) wildlife habitat provided;
20 (c) resident game populations;
21 (d) number, sex, and species of animals taken; and

27 public land lease agreement;
