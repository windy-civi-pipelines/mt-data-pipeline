a direct threat to the safety or health of others or poses a direct threat of physical damage to the property that
cannot be reduced or eliminated by another reasonable accommodation;

federal Fair Housing Act, the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or Title 49, chapter 2.
(10) As used in this section, the following definitions apply:
(a) "Emotional support animal" means an animal that a health care practitioner has determined
provides emotional, cognitive, or other similar support to an individual with a disability and does not need to be
trained or certified. The term does not include service animals as defined in 49-4-203.
