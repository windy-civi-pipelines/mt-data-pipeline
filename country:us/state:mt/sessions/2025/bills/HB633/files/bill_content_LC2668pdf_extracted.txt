1 subsection (8) may within 30 days of that the department's decision submit a written notice requesting a
2 hearing. The notice must contain the grounds upon which the requester contends that the decision is in error
3 and must be limited to the issues raised in written objections and issues in the department's decision not
4 addressed by the department in its notice of determination published pursuant to subsection (8)(e). The hearing
5 must be started within 30 days of the request. For purposes of a hearing, the board or its hearings officer may
6 order site inspections of the area pertinent to the application. The board shall within 20 days of the hearing
7 notify the person who requested the hearing, by certified mail, and all other persons, by regular mail, of the
8 findings and decisions. A person who presided at the informal conference may not preside at the hearing or
9 participate in the decision.
10 (10) In addition to the method of operation, grading, backfilling, highwall reduction, subsidence
11 stabilization, water control, topsoiling, and reclamation requirements of this part and rules adopted under this
12 part, the operator, consistent with the directives of subsection (1), shall:
13 (a) bury under adequate fill all toxic materials, shale, mineral, or any other material determined by
14 the department to be acid-producing, toxic, undesirable, or creating a hazard;
15 (b) as directed by rules, seal off tunnels, shafts, or other openings or any breakthrough of water
16 creating a hazard;
17 (c) impound, drain, or treat all runoff or underground mine waters so as to reduce soil erosion,
18 damage to grazing and agricultural lands, and pollution of surface and subsurface waters;
19 (d) remove or bury all metal, lumber, and other refuse resulting from the operation;
20 (e) use explosives in connection with the operation only in accordance with department regulations
21 designed to minimize noise, damage to adjacent lands, and water pollution and ensure public safety and for
22 other purposes;
23 (f) adopt measures to prevent land subsidence unless the department approves a plan for
24 inducing subsidence into an abandoned operation in a predictable and controlled manner, with measures for
25 grading, topsoiling, and revegetating the subsided land surface. In order for a controlled subsidence plan to be
26 approved, the applicant is required to show that subsidence will not cause a direct or indirect hazard to any
27 public or private buildings, roads, facilities, or use areas, constitute a hazard to human life or health or to
28 domestic livestock or a viable agricultural operation, or violate any other restrictions the department may

1 consider necessary.
2 (g) stockpile and protect from erosion all mining and processing wastes until these wastes can be
3 disposed of according to the provisions of this part;
4 (h) deposit as much stockpiled waste material as possible back into the mine voids upon
5 abandonment in a manner that will prevent or minimize land subsidence. The remaining waste material must be
6 disposed of as provided by this part and the rules of the department.
7 (i) seal all portals, entryways, drifts, shafts, or other openings between the surface and
8 underground mine workings when no longer needed;
9 (j) to the extent possible using the best technology currently available, minimize disturbances and
10 adverse impacts of the operation on fish, wildlife, and related environmental values and achieve enhancement
11 of those resources when practicable;
12 (k) minimize the disturbances to the prevailing hydrologic balance at the mine site and in adjacent
13 areas and to the quality and quantity of water in surface water and ground water systems both during and after
14 strip- or underground-coal-mining operations and during reclamation by:
15 (i) avoiding acid or other toxic mine drainage by measures including but not limited to:
16 (A) preventing or removing water from contact with toxic-producing deposits;
17 (B) treating drainage to reduce toxic content that adversely affects downstream water upon being
18 released to watercourses;
19 (C) casing, sealing, or otherwise managing boreholes, shafts, and wells and keeping acid or other
20 toxic drainage from entering ground and surface waters;
21 (ii) (A) conducting strip- or underground-mining operations so as to prevent, to the extent possible
22 using the best technology currently available, additional contributions of suspended solids to streamflow or
23 runoff outside the permit area, but the contributions may not be in excess of requirements set by applicable
24 state or federal law;
25 (B) constructing any siltation structures pursuant to subsection (10)(k)(ii)(A) prior to
26 commencement of strip- or underground-mining operations, with the structures to be certified by a qualified
27 registered engineer and to be constructed as designed and as approved in the reclamation plan;
28 (iii) cleaning out and removing temporary or large settling ponds or other siltation structures from

2 a manner approved by the department;
3 (iv) restoring recharge capacity of the mined area to approximate premining conditions;
4 (v) avoiding channel deepening or enlargement in operations that requires the discharge of water
5 from mines;
6 (vi) preserving throughout the mining and reclamation process the essential hydrologic functions of
7 alluvial valley floors in the arid and semiarid areas of the country;
8 (vii) designing and constructing reclaimed channels of intermittent streams and perennial streams
9 to ensure long-term stability; and
10 (viii) any other actions that the department may prescribe;
11 (l) conduct strip- or underground-mine operations in accordance with the approved coal
12 conservation plan;
13 (m) stabilize and protect all surface areas, including spoil piles, to effectively control air pollution;
14 (n) seal all auger holes with an impervious and noncombustible material in order to prevent
15 drainage except when the department determines that the resulting impoundment of water in the auger holes
16 may create a hazard to the environment or the public health and safety;
17 (o) develop contingency plans to prevent sustained combustion;
18 (p) refrain from construction of roads or other access ways up a streambed or drainage channel or
19 in proximity to the channel so as to seriously alter the normal flow of water;
20 (q) meet other criteria that are necessary to achieve reclamation in accordance with the purposes
21 of this part, taking into consideration the physical, climatological, and other characteristics of the site;
22 (r) with regard to underground mines, eliminate fire hazards and otherwise eliminate conditions
23 that constitute a hazard to health and safety of the public;
24 (s) locate openings for all new drift mines working acid-producing or iron-producing coal seams in
25 a manner that prevents a gravity discharge of water from the mine.
26 (11) An operator may not throw, dump, pile, or permit the throwing, dumping, or piling or otherwise
27 placing of any overburden, stones, rocks, mineral, earth, soil, dirt, debris, trees, wood, logs, or any other
28 materials or substances of any kind or nature beyond or outside of the area of land that is under permit and for
