7 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
8
9 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Legislative findings. (1) In 1885 the Montana bar association was
10 established as voluntary group.
11 (2) In 1974 the Montana supreme court by court order created the state bar of Montana and made
12 membership mandatory, requiring lawyers to join and pay dues to the state bar of Montana as condition of their
13 law license.
14 (3) Nearly half the states currently have voluntary bar associations that do not require lawyers to
15 join as condition of their law license.
16 (4) Article VII, section 2(3), of the Montana constitution provides in part that the Montana supreme
17 court "may make rules governing appellate procedure, practice and procedure for all other courts, admission to
18 the bar and the conduct of its members".
19 (5) The state bar of Montana does not perform the Montana supreme court's constitutional charge
20 to make rules regarding admission to the bar for lawyers. This function is handled by the attorneys' examining
21 board, a committee the supreme court appoints pursuant to 37-61-102 and Article VII, section 2(3), of the
22 Montana constitution.
23 (6) The state bar of Montana does not perform the supreme court's constitutional charge to make
24 rules regarding "the conduct of [the bar's] members". This function is handled by the office of disciplinary
25 counsel, established by the Montana supreme court pursuant to the authority of the judicial branch found in
26 Article VII, section 2(3), of the Montana constitution.
27 (7) The Montana constitution does not grant power to the Montana supreme court to require
28 lawyers to join the state bar of Montana as a condition of their law license.

69th Legislature 2025 SB 92.1
1 (8) The state bar of Montana regularly lobbies the Montana legislature on various controversial
2 issues.
3 (9) In 2018 the United States supreme court held in Janus v. AFSCME, 585 U.S. 878 (2018), that
4 the government could not compel government workers to pay union dues and had violated employees' free
5 speech rights under the first amendment to the United States constitution.
6 (10) Montana lawyers have the same first amendment right to associate or not associate with
7 groups, particularly groups that may take positions politically that Montana lawyers may not agree with,
8 including the personal decision to join the state bar of Montana.
9 (11) The Montana legislature finds that, consistent with Montana's constitution and the Janus
10 decision, lawyers should not be forced to join or pay dues to the state bar of Montana as a condition of
11 practicing law in the state of Montana.
12
13 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Membership in state bar of Montana voluntary. An attorney admitted
14 by the supreme court to practice law within the state of Montana may not be compelled to join or pay bar dues
