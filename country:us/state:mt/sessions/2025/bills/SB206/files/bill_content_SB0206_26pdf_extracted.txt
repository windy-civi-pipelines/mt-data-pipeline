11 Section 14. Section 41-3-427, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "41-3-427. (Temporary) Petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services --
13 evidence and consideration of harm of removal -- order -- service. (1) (a) In a case in which it appears that
14 a child is abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected, the county attorney, the attorney
15 general, or an attorney hired by the county may file a petition for immediate protection and emergency
16 protective services. In implementing the policy of this section, the child's health and safety are of paramount
17 concern.
18 (b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific
19 authority requested and must be supported by an affidavit signed by a representative of the department stating
20 in detail the alleged facts upon which the request is based and the facts establishing probable cause or, if the
21 case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act provided for in
22 Title 41, chapter 3, part 13, clear and convincing evidence that a child is abused or neglected or is in danger of
23 being abused or neglected.
24 (c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
25 (i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and
26 (ii) specific, written documentation as to why the risk of allowing the child to remain at home
27 substantially outweighs the harm of removing the child, including consideration of:
28 (A) the emotional trauma the child is likely to experience if separated from the family;
- 38 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0206.2
1 (B) the child's relationships with other members of the household, including siblings;
2 (C) the child's schooling and social relationships that could be disrupted with a placement out of
3 the neighborhood;
4 (D) the impact the removal would have on services the child is receiving and on extracurricular
5 activities that benefit the child; and
6 (E) documentation of reasonable efforts made to keep the family intact.
7 (d) If from the alleged facts presented in the affidavit it appears to the court that there is probable
8 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act,
9 clear and convincing evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being
10 abused and neglected, the judge shall grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by
11 subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the
12 alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
13 federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to
14 believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected, the court
15 shall dismiss the petition.
16 (e) If the parents, parent, guardian, person having physical or legal custody of the child, or attorney
17 for the child disputes the material issues of fact contained in the affidavit or the veracity of the affidavit, the
18 person may request a contested show cause hearing pursuant to 41-3-432 within 10 days following service of
19 the petition and affidavit.
20 (f) The petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must include a notice
21 advising the parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child that the
22 parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child may have a support
23 person present during any meeting with a child protection specialist concerning emergency protective services.
24 Reasonable accommodation must be made in scheduling an in-person meeting with the child protection
25 specialist.
26 (2) Pursuant to subsection (1), if the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
27 federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence based
28 on the petition and affidavit, the court may issue an order for immediate protection of the child. The court shall
- 39 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0206.2
1 consider the parents' statements, if any, included with the petition and any accompanying affidavit or report to
2 the court. If the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the
3 Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court may issue an order granting the
4 following forms of relief, which do not constitute a court-ordered treatment plan under 41-3-443:
5 (a) the right of entry by a peace officer or department worker;
6 (b) the right to place the child in temporary medical or out-of-home care, including but not limited to
7 care provided by a noncustodial parent, kinship or foster family, group home, or institution;

9 members who may be considered as placement options for the child;

11 furnish information that the court may designate and obtain evaluations that may be necessary to determine
12 whether a child is a youth in need of care;
13 (e) a requirement that the perpetrator of the alleged child abuse or neglect be removed from the
14 home to allow the child to remain in the home;
15 (f) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the name and address of the other
16 parent, if known, unless parental rights to the child have been terminated;
17 (g) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the names and addresses of
18 extended family members who may be considered as placement options for the child who is the subject of the
19 proceeding; and
20 (h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
21 not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
22 expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
23 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
24 (3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
25 provide the court with information on:
26 (a) whether a kinship placement is available; or
27 (b) if a family foster home has been identified:
28 (i) where the foster home is located in relation to the child's home;

7 (4) In making a removal determination, the court shall weigh and evaluate, in the factual setting,
8 the harm to the child that will result from removal and determine if allowing the child to remain in the home
9 substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
10 but are not limited to:
11 (a) the factors identified in subsections (1)(c)(ii)(A) through (1)(c)(ii)(D); and
12 (b) whether the department made reasonable efforts, as described in subsection (1)(c)(ii)(E), to
13 keep the family intact.
14 (5) (a) An order for removal of a child from the home must include a finding that:
15 (i) continued residence of the child with the parent is contrary to the welfare of the child;
16 (ii) an out-of-home placement is in the best interests of the child; and
17 (iii) the risk of allowing the child to remain in the home substantially outweighs the harm of removal.
18 (b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
19 the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
20 (6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply
21 immediately with the terms of the order and to appear before the court issuing the order on the date specified
22 for a show cause hearing. Upon a failure to comply or show cause, the court may hold the person in contempt
23 or place temporary physical custody of the child with the department until further order.
24 (7) The petition must be served as provided in 41-3-422 or, if the case involves an Indian child, as
25 provided in 41-3-1311. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch. 716, L. 2023.)

3 paramount concern.
4 (b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific
5 authority requested and must be supported by an affidavit signed by a representative of the department stating
6 in detail the alleged facts upon which the request is based and the facts establishing probable cause or, if the
7 case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence that a child is abused or
8 neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected.
9 (c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
10 (i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and
11 (ii) specific, written documentation as to why the risk of allowing the child to remain at home
12 substantially outweighs the harm of removing the child, including consideration of:
13 (A) the emotional trauma the child is likely to experience if separated from the family;
14 (B) the child's relationships with other members of the household, including siblings;
15 (C) the child's schooling and social relationships that could be disrupted with a placement out of
16 the neighborhood;
17 (D) the impact the removal would have on services the child is receiving and on extracurricular
18 activities that benefit the child; and
19 (E) documentation of reasonable efforts made to keep the family intact.
20 (d) If from the alleged facts presented in the affidavit it appears to the court that there is probable
21 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to believe
22 that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused and neglected, the judge shall
23 grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or
24 the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is
25 insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing
26 evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected,
27 the court shall dismiss the petition.
28 (e) If the parents, parent, guardian, person having physical or legal custody of the child, or attorney
- 42 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0206.2
1 for the child disputes the material issues of fact contained in the affidavit or the veracity of the affidavit, the
2 person may request a contested show cause hearing pursuant to 41-3-432 within 10 days following service of
3 the petition and affidavit.
4 (f) The petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must include a notice
5 advising the parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child that the

14 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court
15 may issue an order granting the following forms of relief, which do not constitute a court-ordered treatment plan
16 under 41-3-443:
17 (a) the right of entry by a peace officer or department worker;

14 provided in 41-3-1010:
15 (A) within 30 days of a determination that reasonable efforts to provide preservation or reunification

19 (ii) Within 12 months of a hearing under subsection (1)(a)(i)(B) and every 12 months thereafter
20 until the child is permanently placed in either an adoptive or a guardianship placement, the court or the court-
21 approved entity holding the permanency hearing shall conduct a hearing and the court shall issue a finding as
22 to whether the department has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan for the child.
23 (b) A permanency hearing is not required if the proceeding has been dismissed, the child was not
24 removed from the home, the child has been returned to the child's parent or guardian, or the child has been
25 legally adopted or appointed a legal guardian.
26 (c) The permanency hearing may be combined with a hearing that is required in other sections of
27 this part or with a review held pursuant to 41-3-115 or 41-3-1010 if held within the applicable time limits. If a
28 permanency hearing is combined with another hearing or a review, the requirements of the court related to the
- 45 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0206.2
1 disposition of the other hearing or review must be met in addition to the requirements of this section.
2 (d) The court-approved entity conducting the permanency hearing may elect to hold joint or
3 separate reviews for groups of siblings, but the court shall issue specific findings for each child.
4 (2) At least 3 working days prior to the permanency hearing, the department shall submit a report
5 regarding the child to the entity that will be conducting the hearing for review. The report must address the
6 department's efforts to effectuate the permanency plan for the child, address the options for the child's
7 permanent placement, examine the reasons for excluding higher priority options, and set forth the proposed
8 plan to carry out the placement decision, including specific times for achieving the plan.
9 (3) At least 3 working days prior to the permanency hearing, the guardian ad litem or an attorney
10 or advocate for a parent or guardian may submit an informational report to the entity that will be conducting the
11 hearing for review.
12 (4) In a permanency hearing, the court or other entity conducting the hearing shall consult, in an
13 age-appropriate manner, with the child regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan for the child.
14 (5) (a) The court's order must be issued within 20 days after the permanency hearing if the hearing
15 was conducted by the court.

17 hearing and the minutes and written recommendations must be provided to the court within 20 days of the
18 hearing.
19 (c) If an entity other than the court conducts the hearing and the court concurs with the
20 recommendations, the court may adopt the recommendations as findings with no additional hearing required. In
21 this case, the court shall issue written findings within 10 days of receipt of the written recommendations.
22 (6) The court shall approve a specific permanency plan for the child and make written findings on:
23 (a) whether the child has been asked about the desired permanency outcome;
24 (b) whether the permanency plan is in the best interests of the child;
25 (c) whether the department has made reasonable efforts to effectuate the permanency plan for the
26 individual child;
27 (d) whether the department has made reasonable efforts to finalize the plan;
28 (e) whether there are compelling reasons why it is not in the best interest of the individual child to:
- 46 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0206.2
1 (i) return to the child's home; or
2 (ii) be placed for adoption, with a legal guardian, or with a fit and willing relative; and
3 (f) other necessary steps that the department is required to take to effectuate the terms of the
4 plan.
5 (7) In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best
6 interests of the child that does not conflict with the options provided in subsection (8) and that does not require
7 an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
8 expenditures are reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
9 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
10 (8) Permanency options include:
11 (a) reunification of the child with the child's parent or guardian;
12 (b) permanent placement of the child with the noncustodial parent, superseding any existing
13 custodial order;
14 (c) adoption;
15 (d) appointment of a guardian pursuant to 41-3-444; or
16 (e) long-term custody if the child is in a planned permanent living arrangement and if it is
17 established by a preponderance of the evidence, which is reflected in specific findings by the court, that:
18 (i) the child is being cared for by a fit and willing relative;
19 (ii) the child has an emotional or mental handicap that is so severe that the child cannot function in
20 a family setting and the best interests of the child are served by placement in a residential or group setting;
21 (iii) the child is at least 16 years of age and is participating in an independent living program and
22 that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;
23 (iv) the child's parent is incarcerated and circumstances, including placement of the child and
24 continued, frequent contact with the parent, indicate that it would not be in the best interests of the child to
25 terminate parental rights of that parent; or
26 (v) the child meets the following criteria:
27 (A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
28 (B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by
- 47 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0206.2
1 the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be
2 contrary to the best interests of the child;
3 (C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been
4 considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
5 (D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
6 long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that
7 placement.
8 (9) For a child 14 years of age or older, the permanency plan must:
9 (a) be developed in consultation with the child and in consultation with up to two members of the
10 child's case planning team who are chosen by the child and who are not a foster parent or, child protection
11 specialist investigator, or child reunification specialist for the child;
12 (b) identify one person from the case management team, who is selected by the child, to be
13 designated as the child's advisor and advocate for the application of the reasonable and prudent parenting
14 standard; and
15 (c) include services that will be needed to transition the child from foster care to adulthood.
16 (10) A permanency hearing must document the intensive, ongoing, and unsuccessful efforts made
17 by the department to return the child to the child's home or to secure a permanent placement of the child with a
18 relative, legal guardian, or adoptive parent.
19 (11) The court may terminate a planned permanent living arrangement upon petition of the birth
20 parents or the department if the court finds that the circumstances of the child or family have substantially
21 changed and the best interests of the child are no longer being served."

7 the child is suffering abuse or neglect, the department may provide emergency protective services to the child,
8 pursuant to 41-3-301, or enter into a written prevention plan, pursuant to 41-3-302, and may provide protective

18 (b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific

24 (c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
25 (i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and
26 (ii) specific, written documentation as to why the risk of allowing the child to remain at home

8 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act,
9 clear and convincing evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being
10 abused and neglected, the judge shall grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by
11 subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the
12 alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
13 federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to
14 believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected, the court

17 for the child disputes the material issues of fact contained in the affidavit or the veracity of the affidavit, the

18 extended family members who may be considered as placement options for the child who is the subject of the
19 proceeding; and
20 (h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
21 not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
22 expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
23 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
24 (3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
25 provide the court with information on:

9 substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
10 but are not limited to:
11 (a) the factors identified in subsections (1)(c)(ii)(A) through (1)(c)(ii)(D); and
12 (b) whether the department made reasonable efforts, as described in subsection (1)(c)(ii)(E), to

17 (iii) the risk of allowing the child to remain in the home substantially outweighs the harm of removal.
18 (b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
19 the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
20 (6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply
21 immediately with the terms of the order and to appear before the court issuing the order on the date specified

19 (c) If an entity other than the court conducts the hearing and the court concurs with the
20 recommendations, the court may adopt the recommendations as findings with no additional hearing required. In
21 this case, the court shall issue written findings within 10 days of receipt of the written recommendations.
22 (6) The court shall approve a specific permanency plan for the child and make written findings on:
23 (a) whether the child has been asked about the desired permanency outcome;
24 (b) whether the permanency plan is in the best interests of the child;
25 (c) whether the department has made reasonable efforts to effectuate the permanency plan for the
26 individual child;
27 (d) whether the department has made reasonable efforts to finalize the plan;
28 (e) whether there are compelling reasons why it is not in the best interest of the individual child to:
- 46 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0206.2
1 (i) return to the child's home; or
2 (ii) be placed for adoption, with a legal guardian, or with a fit and willing relative; and
3 (f) other necessary steps that the department is required to take to effectuate the terms of the
4 plan.
5 (7) In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best
6 interests of the child that does not conflict with the options provided in subsection (8) and that does not require
7 an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
8 expenditures are reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
9 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
10 (8) Permanency options include:
11 (a) reunification of the child with the child's parent or guardian;
12 (b) permanent placement of the child with the noncustodial parent, superseding any existing
13 custodial order;
14 (c) adoption;
15 (d) appointment of a guardian pursuant to 41-3-444; or
16 (e) long-term custody if the child is in a planned permanent living arrangement and if it is
17 established by a preponderance of the evidence, which is reflected in specific findings by the court, that:
18 (i) the child is being cared for by a fit and willing relative;
19 (ii) the child has an emotional or mental handicap that is so severe that the child cannot function in
20 a family setting and the best interests of the child are served by placement in a residential or group setting;
21 (iii) the child is at least 16 years of age and is participating in an independent living program and
22 that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;
23 (iv) the child's parent is incarcerated and circumstances, including placement of the child and
24 continued, frequent contact with the parent, indicate that it would not be in the best interests of the child to
25 terminate parental rights of that parent; or
26 (v) the child meets the following criteria:
27 (A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
28 (B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by
- 47 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0206.2
1 the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be
2 contrary to the best interests of the child;
3 (C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been
4 considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
5 (D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
6 long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that
7 placement.
8 (9) For a child 14 years of age or older, the permanency plan must:
9 (a) be developed in consultation with the child and in consultation with up to two members of the
10 child's case planning team who are chosen by the child and who are not a foster parent or, child protection
11 specialist investigator, or child reunification specialist for the child;
12 (b) identify one person from the case management team, who is selected by the child, to be
13 designated as the child's advisor and advocate for the application of the reasonable and prudent parenting
14 standard; and
15 (c) include services that will be needed to transition the child from foster care to adulthood.
16 (10) A permanency hearing must document the intensive, ongoing, and unsuccessful efforts made
17 by the department to return the child to the child's home or to secure a permanent placement of the child with a
18 relative, legal guardian, or adoptive parent.
19 (11) The court may terminate a planned permanent living arrangement upon petition of the birth
20 parents or the department if the court finds that the circumstances of the child or family have substantially
21 changed and the best interests of the child are no longer being served."
