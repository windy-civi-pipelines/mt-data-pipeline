2 attorney general.
3 (c) If the department determines that an investigation and a safety and risk assessment are
4 required, a child protection specialist investigator shall promptly conduct a thorough investigation into the
5 circumstances surrounding the allegations of abuse or neglect of the child and perform a safety and risk
6 assessment to determine whether the living arrangement presents an unsafe environment for the child. The
7 safety and risk assessment may include an investigation at the home of the child involved, the child's school or
8 day-care facility, or any other place where the child is present and into all other nonfinancial matters that in the
9 discretion of the investigator are relevant to the safety and risk assessment. In conducting a safety and risk
10 assessment under this section, a child protection specialist investigator may not inquire into the financial status
11 of the child's family or of any other person responsible for the child's care, except as necessary to ascertain
12 eligibility for state or federal assistance programs or to comply with the provisions of 41-3-446.
13 (2) An initial investigation of alleged abuse or neglect may be conducted when an anonymous
14 report is received. However, if the initial investigation does not within 48 hours result in the development of
15 independent, corroborative, and attributable information indicating that there exists a current risk of physical or
16 psychological harm to the child, a child may not be removed from the living arrangement. If independent,
17 corroborative, and attributable information indicating an ongoing risk results from the initial investigation, the
18 department shall then conduct a safety and risk assessment.
19 (3) The child protection specialist investigator is responsible for conducting the safety and risk
20 assessment. If the child is treated at a medical facility, the child protection specialist investigator, county
21 attorney, or peace officer, consistent with reasonable medical practice, has the right of access to the child for
22 interviews, photographs, and securing physical evidence and has the right of access to relevant hospital and
23 medical records pertaining to the child. If an interview of the child is considered necessary, the child protection
24 specialist investigator, county attorney, or peace officer may conduct an interview of the child. The interview
25 may be conducted in the presence of the parent or guardian or an employee of the school or day-care facility
26 attended by the child.
27 (4) Subject to 41-3-205(3), if the child's interview is audiotaped or videotaped, an unedited

1 audiotape or videotape with audio track must be made available, upon request, for unencumbered review by
2 the family.
3 (5) (a) If from the safety and risk assessment the department has reasonable cause to suspect that
4 the child is suffering abuse or neglect, the department may provide emergency protective services to the child,
5 pursuant to 41-3-301, or enter into a written prevention plan, pursuant to 41-3-302, and may provide protective
6 services to any other child under the same care. The department shall:
7 (i) after interviewing the parent or guardian, if reasonably available, document the determinations
8 of the safety and risk assessment; and
9 (ii) notify the child's family of the determinations of the safety and risk assessment, unless the
10 notification can reasonably be expected to result in harm to the child or other person.
11 (b) Except as provided in subsection (5)(c), the department shall destroy all safety and risk
12 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of
13 the 3-year period starting from the date of completion of the safety and risk assessment.
14 (c) Safety and risk assessment determinations and associated records may be maintained for a
15 reasonable time as defined by department rule under the following circumstances:
16 (i) the safety and risk assessment determines that abuse or neglect occurred;
17 (ii) there had been a previous or there is a subsequent report and investigation resulting in a
18 safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or
19 (iii) an order has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the child as a youth
20 in need of care based on the circumstances surrounding the initial allegations.
21 (6) The investigating child protection specialist investigator, within 60 days of commencing an
22 investigation, shall also furnish a written safety and risk assessment to the department and, upon on request, to
23 the family. Subject to time periods set forth in subsections (5)(b) and (5)(c), the department shall maintain a
24 record system documenting investigations and safety and risk assessment determinations. Unless records are
25 required to be destroyed under subsections (5)(b) and (5)(c), the department shall retain records relating to the
26 safety and risk assessment, including case notes, correspondence, evaluations, videotapes, and interviews, for
27 25 years.

1 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
2 (8) Permanency options include:
3 (a) reunification of the child with the child's parent or guardian;
4 (b) permanent placement of the child with the noncustodial parent, superseding any existing
5 custodial order;
6 (c) adoption;
7 (d) appointment of a guardian pursuant to 41-3-444; or
8 (e) long-term custody if the child is in a planned permanent living arrangement and if it is
9 established by a preponderance of the evidence, which is reflected in specific findings by the court, that:
10 (i) the child is being cared for by a fit and willing relative;
11 (ii) the child has an emotional or mental handicap that is so severe that the child cannot function in
12 a family setting and the best interests of the child are served by placement in a residential or group setting;
13 (iii) the child is at least 16 years of age and is participating in an independent living program and
14 that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;
15 (iv) the child's parent is incarcerated and circumstances, including placement of the child and
16 continued, frequent contact with the parent, indicate that it would not be in the best interests of the child to
17 terminate parental rights of that parent; or
18 (v) the child meets the following criteria:
19 (A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
20 (B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by
21 the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be
22 contrary to the best interests of the child;
23 (C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been
24 considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
25 (D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
26 long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that
27 placement.

1 (9) For a child 14 years of age or older, the permanency plan must:
2 (a) be developed in consultation with the child and in consultation with up to two members of the
3 child's case planning team who are chosen by the child and who are not a foster parent or, child protection
4 specialist investigator, or child reunification specialist for the child;
5 (b) identify one person from the case management team, who is selected by the child, to be
6 designated as the child's advisor and advocate for the application of the reasonable and prudent parenting
7 standard; and
8 (c) include services that will be needed to transition the child from foster care to adulthood.
9 (10) A permanency hearing must document the intensive, ongoing, and unsuccessful efforts made
10 by the department to return the child to the child's home or to secure a permanent placement of the child with a
11 relative, legal guardian, or adoptive parent.
12 (11) The court may terminate a planned permanent living arrangement upon petition of the birth
