11 evidence and consideration of harm of removal -- order -- service. (1) (a) In a case in which it appears that
12 a child is abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected, the county attorney, the attorney
13 general, or an attorney hired by the county may file a petition for immediate protection and emergency
14 protective services. In implementing the policy of this section, the child's health and safety are of paramount
15 concern.
16 (b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific
17 authority requested and must be supported by an affidavit signed by a representative of the department stating
18 in detail the alleged facts upon which the request is based and the facts establishing probable cause or, if the
19 case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act provided for in
20 Title 41, chapter 3, part 13, clear and convincing evidence that a child is abused or neglected or is in danger of
21 being abused or neglected.
22 (c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
23 (i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and
24 (ii) specific, written documentation as to why the risk of allowing the child to remain at home
25 substantially outweighs the harm of removing the child, including consideration of:
26 (A) the emotional trauma the child is likely to experience if separated from the family;
27 (B) the child's relationships with other members of the household, including siblings;
28 (C) the child's schooling and social relationships that could be disrupted with a placement out of

3 activities that benefit the child; and
4 (E) documentation of reasonable efforts made to keep the family intact.
5 (d) If from the alleged facts presented in the affidavit it appears to the court that there is probable
6 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act,
7 clear and convincing evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being
8 abused and neglected, the judge shall grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by
9 subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the
10 alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
11 federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to
12 believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected, the court
13 shall dismiss the petition.
14 (e) If the parents, parent, guardian, person having physical or legal custody of the child, or attorney
15 for the child disputes the material issues of fact contained in the affidavit or the veracity of the affidavit, the
16 person may request a contested show cause hearing pursuant to 41-3-432 within 10 days following service of
17 the petition and affidavit.
18 (f) The petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must include a notice
19 advising the parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child that the

22 Reasonable accommodation must be made in scheduling an in-person meeting with the child protection
23 specialist.
24 (2) Pursuant to subsection (1), if the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
25 federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence based
26 on the petition and affidavit, the court may issue an order for immediate protection of the child. The court shall
27 consider the parents' statements, if any, included with the petition and any accompanying affidavit or report to
28 the court. If the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the

8 but are not limited to:

10 (b) whether the department made reasonable efforts, as described in subsection (1)(c)(ii)(E), to

16 (b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
17 the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
18 (6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply
19 immediately with the terms of the order and to appear before the court issuing the order on the date specified
20 for a show cause hearing. Upon a failure to comply or show cause, the court may hold the person in contempt

3 regarding the child to the entity that will be conducting the hearing for review. The report must address the
4 department's efforts to effectuate the permanency plan for the child, address the options for the child's

1 (f) other necessary steps that the department is required to take to effectuate the terms of the
2 plan.
3 (7) In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best
4 interests of the child that does not conflict with the options provided in subsection (8) and that does not require
5 an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
6 expenditures are reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
7 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.

18 a family setting and the best interests of the child are served by placement in a residential or group setting;
19 (iii) the child is at least 16 years of age and is participating in an independent living program and
20 that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;

22 continued, frequent contact with the parent, indicate that it would not be in the best interests of the child to
23 terminate parental rights of that parent; or
24 (v) the child meets the following criteria:
25 (A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
26 (B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by
27 the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be
28 contrary to the best interests of the child;

69th Legislature 2025 SB 206.1
1 (C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been
2 considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
3 (D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
4 long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that
5 placement.
6 (9) For a child 14 years of age or older, the permanency plan must:

9 specialist investigator, or child reunification specialist for the child;
10 (b) identify one person from the case management team, who is selected by the child, to be
11 designated as the child's advisor and advocate for the application of the reasonable and prudent parenting
12 standard; and
13 (c) include services that will be needed to transition the child from foster care to adulthood.
14 (10) A permanency hearing must document the intensive, ongoing, and unsuccessful efforts made
15 by the department to return the child to the child's home or to secure a permanent placement of the child with a
16 relative, legal guardian, or adoptive parent.
17 (11) The court may terminate a planned permanent living arrangement upon petition of the birth
18 parents or the department if the court finds that the circumstances of the child or family have substantially
19 changed and the best interests of the child are no longer being served."
