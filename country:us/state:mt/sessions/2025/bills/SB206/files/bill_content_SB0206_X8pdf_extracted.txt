cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act,
clear and convincing evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being
abused and neglected, the judge shall grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by
subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the
alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to
believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected, the court
shall dismiss the petition.
(e) If the parents, parent, guardian, person having physical or legal custody of the child, or attorney

person may request a contested show cause hearing pursuant to 41-3-432 within 10 days following service of
the petition and affidavit.
(f) The petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must include a notice
advising the parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child that the

Reasonable accommodation must be made in scheduling an in-person meeting with the child protection
specialist.

- 39 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 206
on the petition and affidavit, the court may issue an order for immediate protection of the child. The court shall
consider the parents' statements, if any, included with the petition and any accompanying affidavit or report to
the court. If the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the
Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court may issue an order granting the
following forms of relief, which do not constitute a court-ordered treatment plan under 41-3-443:
(a) the right of entry by a peace officer or department worker;
(b) the right to place the child in temporary medical or out-of-home care, including but not limited to
care provided by a noncustodial parent, kinship or foster family, group home, or institution;
(c) the right of the department to locate, contact, and share information with any extended family
members who may be considered as placement options for the child;

furnish information that the court may designate and obtain evaluations that may be necessary to determine
whether a child is a youth in need of care;
(e) a requirement that the perpetrator of the alleged child abuse or neglect be removed from the
home to allow the child to remain in the home;
(f) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the name and address of the other
parent, if known, unless parental rights to the child have been terminated;
(g) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the names and addresses of
extended family members who may be considered as placement options for the child who is the subject of the
proceeding; and
(h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
(3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
provide the court with information on:
(a) whether a kinship placement is available; or
(b) if a family foster home has been identified:

(iii) whether siblings can be placed together;
(iv) the proximity of the foster home to the child's home and school;
(v) whether the child will be able to observe religious or cultural practices important to the child;
and
(vi) whether the foster home is able to accommodate any special needs the child may have.
(4) In making a removal determination, the court shall weigh and evaluate, in the factual setting,
the harm to the child that will result from removal and determine if allowing the child to remain in the home
substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
but are not limited to:
(a) the factors identified in subsections (1)(c)(ii)(A) through (1)(c)(ii)(D); and
(b) whether the department made reasonable efforts, as described in subsection (1)(c)(ii)(E), to
keep the family intact.
(5) (a) An order for removal of a child from the home must include a finding that:
(i) continued residence of the child with the parent is contrary to the welfare of the child;
(ii) an out-of-home placement is in the best interests of the child; and
(iii) the risk of allowing the child to remain in the home substantially outweighs the harm of removal.
(b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
(6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply
immediately with the terms of the order and to appear before the court issuing the order on the date specified
for a show cause hearing. Upon a failure to comply or show cause, the court may hold the person in contempt
or place temporary physical custody of the child with the department until further order.
(7) The petition must be served as provided in 41-3-422 or, if the case involves an Indian child, as
provided in 41-3-1311. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch. 716, L. 2023.)

neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected.
(c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
(i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and
(ii) specific, written documentation as to why the risk of allowing the child to remain at home
substantially outweighs the harm of removing the child, including consideration of:
(A) the emotional trauma the child is likely to experience if separated from the family;
(B) the child's relationships with other members of the household, including siblings;
(C) the child's schooling and social relationships that could be disrupted with a placement out of
the neighborhood;
(D) the impact the removal would have on services the child is receiving and on extracurricular
activities that benefit the child; and
(E) documentation of reasonable efforts made to keep the family intact.
(d) If from the alleged facts presented in the affidavit it appears to the court that there is probable
cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to believe
that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused and neglected, the judge shall
grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or
the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is
insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing
evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected,
the court shall dismiss the petition.

(e) If the parents, parent, guardian, person having physical or legal custody of the child, or attorney
for the child disputes the material issues of fact contained in the affidavit or the veracity of the affidavit, the
person may request a contested show cause hearing pursuant to 41-3-432 within 10 days following service of
the petition and affidavit.
(f) The petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must include a notice
advising the parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child that the
parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child may have a support
person present during any meeting with a child protection specialist investigator or a child reunification
specialist concerning emergency protective services. Reasonable accommodation must be made in scheduling
an in-person meeting with the child protection specialist investigator and the child reunification specialist.
(2) Pursuant to subsection (1), if the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence based on the petition and affidavit, the court
may issue an order for immediate protection of the child. The court shall consider the parents' statements, if
any, included with the petition and any accompanying affidavit or report to the court. If the court finds probable
cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court
may issue an order granting the following forms of relief, which do not constitute a court-ordered treatment plan
under 41-3-443:
(a) the right of entry by a peace officer or department worker;
(b) the right to place the child in temporary medical or out-of-home care, including but not limited to
care provided by a noncustodial parent, kinship or foster family, group home, or institution;
(c) the right of the department to locate, contact, and share information with any extended family
members who may be considered as placement options for the child;
(d) a requirement that the parents, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody
furnish information that the court may designate and obtain evaluations that may be necessary to determine
whether a child is a youth in need of care;
(e) a requirement that the perpetrator of the alleged child abuse or neglect be removed from the
home to allow the child to remain in the home;
(f) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the name and address of the other
- 43 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 206
parent, if known, unless parental rights to the child have been terminated;
(g) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the names and addresses of
extended family members who may be considered as placement options for the child who is the subject of the
proceeding; and
(h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
(3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
provide the court with information on:
(a) whether a kinship placement is available; or
(b) if a family foster home has been identified:
(i) where the foster home is located in relation to the child's home;
(ii) whether the foster placement can accommodate the proposed visitation schedule;
(iii) whether siblings can be placed together;
(iv) the proximity of the foster home to the child's home and school;
(v) whether the child will be able to observe religious or cultural practices important to the child;
and
(vi) whether the foster home is able to accommodate any special needs the child may have.
(4) In making a removal determination, the court shall weigh and evaluate, in the factual setting,
the harm to the child that will result from removal and determine if allowing the child to remain in the home
substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
but are not limited to:
(a) the factors identified in subsections (1)(c)(ii)(A) through (1)(c)(ii)(D); and
(b) whether the department made reasonable efforts, as described in subsection (1)(c)(ii)(E), to
keep the family intact.
(5) (a) An order for removal of a child from the home must include a finding that:
(i) continued residence of the child with the parent is contrary to the welfare of the child;
- 44 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 206
(ii) an out-of-home placement is in the best interests of the child; and
(iii) the risk of allowing the child to remain in the home substantially outweighs the harm of removal.
(b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
(6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply
immediately with the terms of the order and to appear before the court issuing the order on the date specified
for a show cause hearing. Upon a failure to comply or show cause, the court may hold the person in contempt
or place temporary physical custody of the child with the department until further order.
(7) The petition must be served as provided in 41-3-422."

(B) no later than 12 months after the initial court finding that the child has been subjected to abuse
or neglect or 12 months after the child's first 60 days of removal from the home, whichever comes first.
(ii) Within 12 months of a hearing under subsection (1)(a)(i)(B) and every 12 months thereafter
until the child is permanently placed in either an adoptive or a guardianship placement, the court or the court-
approved entity holding the permanency hearing shall conduct a hearing and the court shall issue a finding as
to whether the department has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan for the child.
(b) A permanency hearing is not required if the proceeding has been dismissed, the child was not
removed from the home, the child has been returned to the child's parent or guardian, or the child has been
legally adopted or appointed a legal guardian.
(c) The permanency hearing may be combined with a hearing that is required in other sections of
this part or with a review held pursuant to 41-3-115 or 41-3-1010 if held within the applicable time limits. If a
- 45 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 206
permanency hearing is combined with another hearing or a review, the requirements of the court related to the
disposition of the other hearing or review must be met in addition to the requirements of this section.
(d) The court-approved entity conducting the permanency hearing may elect to hold joint or
separate reviews for groups of siblings, but the court shall issue specific findings for each child.
(2) At least 3 working days prior to the permanency hearing, the department shall submit a report
regarding the child to the entity that will be conducting the hearing for review. The report must address the
department's efforts to effectuate the permanency plan for the child, address the options for the child's
permanent placement, examine the reasons for excluding higher priority options, and set forth the proposed
plan to carry out the placement decision, including specific times for achieving the plan.
(3) At least 3 working days prior to the permanency hearing, the guardian ad litem or an attorney
or advocate for a parent or guardian may submit an informational report to the entity that will be conducting the
hearing for review.
(4) In a permanency hearing, the court or other entity conducting the hearing shall consult, in an
age-appropriate manner, with the child regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan for the child.
(5) (a) The court's order must be issued within 20 days after the permanency hearing if the hearing
was conducted by the court.
(b) If an entity other than the court conducts the hearing, the entity shall keep minutes of the
hearing and the minutes and written recommendations must be provided to the court within 20 days of the
hearing.
(c) If an entity other than the court conducts the hearing and the court concurs with the
recommendations, the court may adopt the recommendations as findings with no additional hearing required. In
this case, the court shall issue written findings within 10 days of receipt of the written recommendations.
(6) The court shall approve a specific permanency plan for the child and make written findings on:
(a) whether the child has been asked about the desired permanency outcome;
(b) whether the permanency plan is in the best interests of the child;
(c) whether the department has made reasonable efforts to effectuate the permanency plan for the
individual child;
(d) whether the department has made reasonable efforts to finalize the plan;
- 46 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 206
(e) whether there are compelling reasons why it is not in the best interest of the individual child to:
(i) return to the child's home; or
(ii) be placed for adoption, with a legal guardian, or with a fit and willing relative; and
(f) other necessary steps that the department is required to take to effectuate the terms of the
plan.
(7) In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best
interests of the child that does not conflict with the options provided in subsection (8) and that does not require
an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
expenditures are reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
(8) Permanency options include:
(a) reunification of the child with the child's parent or guardian;
(b) permanent placement of the child with the noncustodial parent, superseding any existing
custodial order;
(c) adoption;
(d) appointment of a guardian pursuant to 41-3-444; or
(e) long-term custody if the child is in a planned permanent living arrangement and if it is
established by a preponderance of the evidence, which is reflected in specific findings by the court, that:
(i) the child is being cared for by a fit and willing relative;
(ii) the child has an emotional or mental handicap that is so severe that the child cannot function in
a family setting and the best interests of the child are served by placement in a residential or group setting;
(iii) the child is at least 16 years of age and is participating in an independent living program and
that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;
(iv) the child's parent is incarcerated and circumstances, including placement of the child and
continued, frequent contact with the parent, indicate that it would not be in the best interests of the child to
terminate parental rights of that parent; or
(v) the child meets the following criteria:
(A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
- 47 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 206
(B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by
the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be
contrary to the best interests of the child;
(C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been
considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
(D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that
placement.
(9) For a child 14 years of age or older, the permanency plan must:
(a) be developed in consultation with the child and in consultation with up to two members of the
child's case planning team who are chosen by the child and who are not a foster parent or, child protection
specialist investigator, or child reunification specialist for the child;
(b) identify one person from the case management team, who is selected by the child, to be
designated as the child's advisor and advocate for the application of the reasonable and prudent parenting
standard; and
(c) include services that will be needed to transition the child from foster care to adulthood.
(10) A permanency hearing must document the intensive, ongoing, and unsuccessful efforts made
by the department to return the child to the child's home or to secure a permanent placement of the child with a
relative, legal guardian, or adoptive parent.
(11) The court may terminate a planned permanent living arrangement upon petition of the birth
parents or the department if the court finds that the circumstances of the child or family have substantially
changed and the best interests of the child are no longer being served."

Section 21:
Section 16. Codification instruction. [Section 1] is intended to be codified as an integral part of Title
41, chapter 3, part 1, and the provisions of Title 41, chapter 3, part 1, apply to [section 1].

sole reason that a parent or legal guardian, because of religious beliefs, does not provide adequate health care

state to ensure that medical care is provided to the child when there is imminent substantial risk of serious harm
to the child.

hearing for review.
(4) In a permanency hearing, the court or other entity conducting the hearing shall consult, in an
age-appropriate manner, with the child regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan for the child.
(5) (a) The court's order must be issued within 20 days after the permanency hearing if the hearing
was conducted by the court.
(b) If an entity other than the court conducts the hearing, the entity shall keep minutes of the
hearing and the minutes and written recommendations must be provided to the court within 20 days of the
hearing.
(c) If an entity other than the court conducts the hearing and the court concurs with the
recommendations, the court may adopt the recommendations as findings with no additional hearing required. In
this case, the court shall issue written findings within 10 days of receipt of the written recommendations.
(6) The court shall approve a specific permanency plan for the child and make written findings on:
(a) whether the child has been asked about the desired permanency outcome;

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 206
(e) whether there are compelling reasons why it is not in the best interest of the individual child to:
(i) return to the child's home; or
(ii) be placed for adoption, with a legal guardian, or with a fit and willing relative; and
(f) other necessary steps that the department is required to take to effectuate the terms of the
plan.
(7) In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best
interests of the child that does not conflict with the options provided in subsection (8) and that does not require
an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
expenditures are reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
(8) Permanency options include:
(a) reunification of the child with the child's parent or guardian;
(b) permanent placement of the child with the noncustodial parent, superseding any existing
custodial order;
(c) adoption;
(d) appointment of a guardian pursuant to 41-3-444; or
(e) long-term custody if the child is in a planned permanent living arrangement and if it is
established by a preponderance of the evidence, which is reflected in specific findings by the court, that:
(i) the child is being cared for by a fit and willing relative;
(ii) the child has an emotional or mental handicap that is so severe that the child cannot function in
a family setting and the best interests of the child are served by placement in a residential or group setting;
(iii) the child is at least 16 years of age and is participating in an independent living program and
that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;
(iv) the child's parent is incarcerated and circumstances, including placement of the child and
continued, frequent contact with the parent, indicate that it would not be in the best interests of the child to
terminate parental rights of that parent; or
(v) the child meets the following criteria:
(A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
- 47 - Authorized Print Version – SB 206
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 206
(B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by
the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be
contrary to the best interests of the child;
(C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been
considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
(D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that
placement.
(9) For a child 14 years of age or older, the permanency plan must:
(a) be developed in consultation with the child and in consultation with up to two members of the
child's case planning team who are chosen by the child and who are not a foster parent or, child protection
specialist investigator, or child reunification specialist for the child;
(b) identify one person from the case management team, who is selected by the child, to be
designated as the child's advisor and advocate for the application of the reasonable and prudent parenting
standard; and
(c) include services that will be needed to transition the child from foster care to adulthood.
(10) A permanency hearing must document the intensive, ongoing, and unsuccessful efforts made
by the department to return the child to the child's home or to secure a permanent placement of the child with a
relative, legal guardian, or adoptive parent.
(11) The court may terminate a planned permanent living arrangement upon petition of the birth
parents or the department if the court finds that the circumstances of the child or family have substantially
changed and the best interests of the child are no longer being served."
