8 avoid the fine by complying with a court order and is criminal if the contemnor cannot end the incarceration or
9 avoid the fine by complying with a court order. If the court's purpose in imposing the sanction is to attempt to

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2822

7 (i) (A) not more than 3 months; or
8 (ii) (B) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
9 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
10 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
11 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
12 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
13 in 53-21-190; or
14 (c) (ii) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
15 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
16 (i) (A) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
17 established in administrative rules of the department; and
18 (ii) (B) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
19 for admission.
20 (b) The court may not commit the respondent to a private mental health facility or hospital without
21 the express consent of the facility or hospital.
22 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii) (3)(a)(ii)(A), a treatment ordered pursuant to this
23 section may not affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
24 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
25 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
26 treatment.
27 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
28 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
- 8 - LC 2822

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2822
1 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
2 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
3 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
4 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
5 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
6 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
7 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
8 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
9 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
10 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
11 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be

13 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
14 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
15 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon on any of the criterion criteria provided in 53-21-126(1)(d),
16 the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
17 facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b) (3)(a)(ii), and may
18 not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health
19 nursing care center.
20 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall attest that the court has not
21 relied solely on the criteria provided in 53-21-126(1)(d) and shall make the following findings of fact:
22 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
23 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
24 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
25 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
26 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
27 respondent;
28 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
- 9 - LC 2822

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2822
1 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
2 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
3 chosen from among other alternatives;
4 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
5 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
6 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
7 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
8 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
9 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
10 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
11 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
12 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
13 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
14 from among other alternatives.
15 (9) Any mental health evaluation report of a professional person who evaluated the respondent or
16 patient in connection with the commitment must be filed under seal at the time of the filing of the court's order
17 but must be made available to the mental health facility to which the respondent or patient is committed.
18 (10) A court may not order the transfer or transport of a respondent or patient to the Montana state
19 hospital until the hospital has confirmed in writing that:
20 (a) a bed is available for the respondent or patient;
21 (b) admission of the respondent or patient will not cause the census at the hospital to exceed its
22 licensed bed capacity; and
23 (c) the information and records requested by the hospital are received, including:
24 (i) physical and psychiatric health information sufficient to:
25 (A) evaluate the immediate treatment needs and appropriate placement of the respondent or
26 patient, including the availability of less restrictive medically appropriate facilities; and
27 (B) coordinate care with the professional person, county attorney, court, or the person or entity
28 transporting the respondent during the admission process;

4 requirements of subsection (10) are fulfilled.
5 (12) The Montana state hospital may refuse to admit into its custody a respondent or patient who
6 has been ordered to be transferred or transported to the hospital until:
7 (a) a bed is available for the respondent or patient;
8 (b) admission of the respondent or patient will not cause the census at the hospital to exceed its
9 licensed bed capacity;
10 (c) admission will not cause the hospital to violate any law, rule, or certification or licensing
11 provision; and
12 (d) the information and records requested by the hospital under subsection (10)(c) are received by
13 the hospital.
14 53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and
15 the petition dismissed if, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent:
16 (a) is not suffering from a mental disorder;
17 (b) does not require commitment within the meaning of this part; or
18 (c) is suffering from a mental disorder but the respondent's primary diagnosis is Alzheimer's
19 disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
20 criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).
21 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
22 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
23 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
24 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
25 respondent.
26 (3) (a) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
27 the court shall:
28 (a) (i) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
- 11 - LC 2822

3 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
4 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
5 (i) (A) not more than 3 months; or
6 (ii) (B) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
7 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
8 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
9 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
10 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
11 in 53-21-190; or
12 (c) (iii) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
13 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
14 (i) (A) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
15 established in administrative rules of the department; and
16 (ii) (B) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
17 for admission.
18 (b) The court may not commit the respondent to a private mental health facility or hospital without
19 the express consent of the facility or hospital.
20 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii) (3)(a)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section
21 may not affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
22 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
23 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
24 treatment.

69th Legislature 2025 LC 2822

10 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The

12 (7) Except as provided in 53-21-126(7), satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1)
13 justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter. However, if the court relies solely on any of the criterion criteria
14 provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include
15 a category D assisted living facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in
16 subsection (3)(b) (3)(a)(ii), and may not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient
17 facility, or the Montana mental health nursing care center.

19 relied solely on the criteria provided in 53-21-126(1)(d) and shall make the following findings of fact:
