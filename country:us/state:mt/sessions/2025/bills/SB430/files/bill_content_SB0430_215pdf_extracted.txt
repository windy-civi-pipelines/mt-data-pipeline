21 SECTION 5. SECTION 53-21-126, MCA, IS AMENDED TO READ:
22 "53-21-126. (Temporary) Trial or hearing on petition. (1) The respondent must be present unless
23 the respondent's presence has been waived as provided in 53-21-119(2), and the respondent must be
24 represented by counsel at all stages of the trial. The trial must be limited to the determination of whether or not
25 the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. At the trial, the court shall
26 consider all the facts relevant to the issues of whether the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder. If the
27 court determines that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder, the court shall then determine whether
28 the respondent requires commitment. In determining whether the respondent requires commitment and the
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – SB 430
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0430.2
1 appropriate disposition under 53-21-127, the court shall consider the following:
2 (a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the
3 respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;
4 (b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an
5 omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;
6 (c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent
7 or to others because of the respondent's acts or omissions; and
8 (d) whether the respondent's mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent's recent acts or
9 omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent's mental condition to the point
10 at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the
11 respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety. Predictability may be established by
12 the respondent's relevant medical history.
13 (2) The standard of proof in a hearing held pursuant to this section is proof beyond a reasonable
14 doubt with respect to any physical facts or evidence and clear and convincing evidence as to all other matters.
15 However, the respondent's mental disorder must be proved to a reasonable medical certainty. Imminent threat
16 of self-inflicted injury or injury to others must be proved by overt acts or omissions, sufficiently recent in time as
17 to be material and relevant as to the respondent's present condition.
18 (3) The professional person appointed by the court must be present for the trial and subject to
19 cross-examination. The professional person's presence may be accomplished by the use of two-way electronic
20 audio-video communication. The trial is governed by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. However, if the
21 issues are tried by a jury, at least two-thirds of the jurors shall concur on a finding that the respondent is
22 suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. The written report of the professional person that
23 indicates the professional person's diagnosis may be attached to the petition, but any matter otherwise
24 inadmissible, such as hearsay matter, is not admissible merely because it is contained in the report. The court
25 may order the trial closed to the public for the protection of the respondent.
26 (4) The professional person may testify as to the ultimate issue of whether the respondent is
27 suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. This testimony is insufficient unless accompanied
28 by evidence from the professional person or others that:
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – SB 430
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0430.2
1 (a) the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the
2 respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;
3 (b) the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission,
4 caused self-injury or injury to others;
5 (c) because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat danger of injury to the respondent or
6 to others because of the respondent's acts or omissions; or
7 (d) (i) the respondent's mental disorder:
8 (A) has resulted in recent acts, omissions, or behaviors that create difficulty in protecting the
9 respondent's life or health;
10 (B) is treatable, with a reasonable prospect of success;
11 (C) has resulted in the respondent's refusing or being unable to consent to voluntary admission for
12 treatment; and
13 (ii) will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent's mental condition to the
14 point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the
15 respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety. Predictability may be established by
16 the respondent's relevant medical history; or
17 (e) whether an emergency situation as defined in 53-21-102 exists.
18 (5) The court, upon the showing of good cause and when it is in the best interests of the
19 respondent, may order a change of venue.
20 (6) An individual with a primary diagnosis of a mental disorder who also has a co-occurring
21 diagnosis of chemical dependency may satisfy criteria for commitment under this part.
22 53-21-126. (Effective July 1, 2025) Trial or hearing on petition. (1) The respondent must be
23 present unless the respondent's presence has been waived as provided in 53-21-119(2), and the respondent
24 must be represented by counsel at all stages of the trial. The trial must be limited to the determination of
25 whether or not the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. At the trial, the
26 court shall consider all the facts relevant to the issues of whether the respondent is suffering from a mental
27 disorder. If the court determines that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder, the court shall then
28 determine whether the respondent requires commitment. In determining whether the respondent requires
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – SB 430
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0430.2
1 commitment and the appropriate disposition under 53-21-127, the court shall consider the following:
2 (a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the
3 respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;
4 (b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an
5 omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;
6 (c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat danger of injury to the
7 respondent or to others because of the respondent's acts or omissions; and
8 (d) (i) whether the respondent's mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent's recent acts
9 or omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent's mental condition to the
10 point at which the respondent will:
11 (A) become a danger to self or to others; or
12 (B) be unable to provide for the respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or
13 safety.
14 (ii) Predictability may be established by the respondent's relevant medical history; and
15 (e) whether an emergency situation as defined in 53-21-102 exists.
16 (2) The standard of proof in a hearing held pursuant to this section is proof beyond a reasonable
17 doubt with respect to any physical facts or evidence and clear and convincing evidence as to all other matters.
18 However, the respondent's mental disorder must be proved to a reasonable medical certainty. Imminent threat
19 of self-inflicted injury or injury to others must be proved by overt acts or omissions, sufficiently recent in time as
20 to be material and relevant as to the respondent's present condition.

1 Section 6. Section 53-21-127, MCA, is amended to read:
2 "53-21-127. (Temporary) Posttrial disposition. (1) If, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent
3 is not suffering from a mental disorder or does not require commitment within the meaning of this part, the
4 respondent must be discharged and the petition dismissed.
5 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
6 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
7 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
8 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
9 respondent.
10 (3) (a) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
11 the court shall:
12 (a)(i) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
13 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
14 (b)(ii) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
15 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
16 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
17 (i)(A) not more than 3 months; or
18 (ii)(B) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
19 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
20 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
21 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
22 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
23 in 53-21-190; or
24 (c)(ii) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
25 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:

2 (b) The court may not commit the respondent to a private mental health facility or hospital without
3 the express consent of the facility or hospital.
4 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii) (3)(a)(ii)(A), a treatment ordered pursuant to this
5 section may not affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
6 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
7 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
8 treatment.
9 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
10 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
11 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
12 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
13 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
14 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
15 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
16 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
17 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
18 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The

23 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
24 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
25 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon on any of the criterion criteria provided in 53-21-126(1)(d),
26 the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
27 facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b) (3)(a)(ii), and may
28 not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health

1 nursing care center.
2 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall attest that the court has not
3 relied solely on the criteria provided in 53-21-126(1)(d) and shall make the following findings of fact:
4 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
5 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
6 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
7 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
8 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
9 respondent;
10 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
11 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
12 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
13 chosen from among other alternatives;
14 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
15 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
16 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
17 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
18 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
19 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
20 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
21 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
22 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
23 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
24 from among other alternatives.
25 (9) Any mental health evaluation report of a professional person who evaluated the respondent or
26 patient in connection with the commitment must be filed under seal at the time of the filing of the court's order
27 but must be made available to the mental health facility to which the respondent or patient is committed.

10 transporting the respondent during the admission process;

15 (12) The Montana state hospital may refuse to admit into its custody a respondent or patient who
16 has been ordered to be transferred or transported to the hospital until:
17 (a) a bed is available for the respondent or patient;
18 (b) admission of the respondent or patient will not cause the census at the hospital to exceed its
19 licensed bed capacity;

69th Legislature 2025 SB0430.2
1 disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
2 criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).

4 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
5 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
6 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
7 respondent.
8 (3) (a) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
9 the court shall:
10 (a) (i) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a

14 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
15 (i)(A) not more than 3 months; or
16 (ii)(B) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
17 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
18 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
19 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
20 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
21 in 53-21-190; or
22 (c)(iii) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
23 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:

5 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
6 treatment.
7 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
8 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
9 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be

13 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
14 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The

21 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
22 (7) Except as provided in 53-21-126(7), satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1)
23 justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter. However, if the court relies solely on any of the criterion criteria
24 provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include
25 a category D assisted living facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in
26 subsection (3)(b) (3)(a)(ii), and may not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient

22 "53-21-126. (Temporary) Trial or hearing on petition. (1) The respondent must be present unless
23 the respondent's presence has been waived as provided in 53-21-119(2), and the respondent must be
24 represented by counsel at all stages of the trial. The trial must be limited to the determination of whether or not
25 the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. At the trial, the court shall
26 consider all the facts relevant to the issues of whether the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder. If the
27 court determines that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder, the court shall then determine whether
28 the respondent requires commitment. In determining whether the respondent requires commitment and the
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – SB 430

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0430.2
1 appropriate disposition under 53-21-127, the court shall consider the following:
2 (a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the
3 respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;
4 (b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an
5 omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;
6 (c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent
7 or to others because of the respondent's acts or omissions; and
8 (d) whether the respondent's mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent's recent acts or
9 omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent's mental condition to the point
10 at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the
11 respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety. Predictability may be established by
12 the respondent's relevant medical history.
13 (2) The standard of proof in a hearing held pursuant to this section is proof beyond a reasonable
14 doubt with respect to any physical facts or evidence and clear and convincing evidence as to all other matters.
15 However, the respondent's mental disorder must be proved to a reasonable medical certainty. Imminent threat
16 of self-inflicted injury or injury to others must be proved by overt acts or omissions, sufficiently recent in time as
17 to be material and relevant as to the respondent's present condition.
18 (3) The professional person appointed by the court must be present for the trial and subject to
19 cross-examination. The professional person's presence may be accomplished by the use of two-way electronic
20 audio-video communication. The trial is governed by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. However, if the
21 issues are tried by a jury, at least two-thirds of the jurors shall concur on a finding that the respondent is
22 suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. The written report of the professional person that
23 indicates the professional person's diagnosis may be attached to the petition, but any matter otherwise
24 inadmissible, such as hearsay matter, is not admissible merely because it is contained in the report. The court
25 may order the trial closed to the public for the protection of the respondent.
26 (4) The professional person may testify as to the ultimate issue of whether the respondent is
27 suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. This testimony is insufficient unless accompanied
28 by evidence from the professional person or others that:
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – SB 430

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0430.2
1 (a) the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the
2 respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;
3 (b) the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission,
4 caused self-injury or injury to others;
5 (c) because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat danger of injury to the respondent or
6 to others because of the respondent's acts or omissions; or
7 (d) (i) the respondent's mental disorder:
8 (A) has resulted in recent acts, omissions, or behaviors that create difficulty in protecting the
9 respondent's life or health;
10 (B) is treatable, with a reasonable prospect of success;
11 (C) has resulted in the respondent's refusing or being unable to consent to voluntary admission for
12 treatment; and
13 (ii) will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent's mental condition to the
14 point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the
15 respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety. Predictability may be established by
16 the respondent's relevant medical history; or
17 (e) whether an emergency situation as defined in 53-21-102 exists.
18 (5) The court, upon the showing of good cause and when it is in the best interests of the
19 respondent, may order a change of venue.
20 (6) An individual with a primary diagnosis of a mental disorder who also has a co-occurring
21 diagnosis of chemical dependency may satisfy criteria for commitment under this part.
22 53-21-126. (Effective July 1, 2025) Trial or hearing on petition. (1) The respondent must be
23 present unless the respondent's presence has been waived as provided in 53-21-119(2), and the respondent
24 must be represented by counsel at all stages of the trial. The trial must be limited to the determination of
25 whether or not the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. At the trial, the
26 court shall consider all the facts relevant to the issues of whether the respondent is suffering from a mental
27 disorder. If the court determines that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder, the court shall then
28 determine whether the respondent requires commitment. In determining whether the respondent requires

1 commitment and the appropriate disposition under 53-21-127, the court shall consider the following:
2 (a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the
3 respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;
4 (b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an
5 omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;
6 (c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat danger of injury to the
7 respondent or to others because of the respondent's acts or omissions; and
8 (d) (i) whether the respondent's mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent's recent acts
9 or omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent's mental condition to the
10 point at which the respondent will:
11 (A) become a danger to self or to others; or
12 (B) be unable to provide for the respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or
13 safety.
14 (ii) Predictability may be established by the respondent's relevant medical history; and
15 (e) whether an emergency situation as defined in 53-21-102 exists.
16 (2) The standard of proof in a hearing held pursuant to this section is proof beyond a reasonable
17 doubt with respect to any physical facts or evidence and clear and convincing evidence as to all other matters.
18 However, the respondent's mental disorder must be proved to a reasonable medical certainty. Imminent threat
19 of self-inflicted injury or injury to others must be proved by overt acts or omissions, sufficiently recent in time as
20 to be material and relevant as to the respondent's present condition.
21 (3) The professional person appointed by the court must be present for the trial and subject to
22 cross-examination. The professional person's presence may be accomplished by the use of two-way electronic
23 audio-video communication. The trial is governed by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. However, if the
24 issues are tried by a jury, at least two-thirds of the jurors shall concur on a finding that the respondent is

26 indicates the professional person's diagnosis may be attached to the petition, but any matter otherwise
27 inadmissible, such as hearsay matter, is not admissible merely because it is contained in the report. The court

1 Section 6. Section 53-21-127, MCA, is amended to read:
2 "53-21-127. (Temporary) Posttrial disposition. (1) If, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent
3 is not suffering from a mental disorder or does not require commitment within the meaning of this part, the
4 respondent must be discharged and the petition dismissed.
5 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
6 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
7 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
8 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
9 respondent.
10 (3) (a) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
11 the court shall:
12 (a)(i) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
13 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
14 (b)(ii) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
15 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
16 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
17 (i)(A) not more than 3 months; or
18 (ii)(B) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
19 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
20 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
21 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
22 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
23 in 53-21-190; or
24 (c)(ii) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
25 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
26 (i)(A) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
27 established in administrative rules of the department; and
28 (ii)(B) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – SB 430

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0430.2
1 for admission.
2 (b) The court may not commit the respondent to a private mental health facility or hospital without
3 the express consent of the facility or hospital.
4 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii) (3)(a)(ii)(A), a treatment ordered pursuant to this
5 section may not affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
6 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
7 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
8 treatment.
9 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
10 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
11 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
12 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
13 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
14 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
15 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
16 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
17 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
18 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
19 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
20 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
21 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
22 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
23 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
24 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
25 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon on any of the criterion criteria provided in 53-21-126(1)(d),
26 the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
27 facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b) (3)(a)(ii), and may
28 not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health

1 nursing care center.
2 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall attest that the court has not
3 relied solely on the criteria provided in 53-21-126(1)(d) and shall make the following findings of fact:
4 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
5 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
6 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
7 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
8 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
9 respondent;
10 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
11 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
12 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
13 chosen from among other alternatives;
14 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
15 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
16 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
17 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
18 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
19 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
20 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
21 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
22 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
23 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
24 from among other alternatives.
25 (9) Any mental health evaluation report of a professional person who evaluated the respondent or
26 patient in connection with the commitment must be filed under seal at the time of the filing of the court's order
27 but must be made available to the mental health facility to which the respondent or patient is committed.

16 has been ordered to be transferred or transported to the hospital until:
17 (a) a bed is available for the respondent or patient;
18 (b) admission of the respondent or patient will not cause the census at the hospital to exceed its
19 licensed bed capacity;
20 (c) admission will not cause the hospital to violate any law, rule, or certification or licensing
21 provision; and
22 (d) the information and records requested by the hospital under subsection (10)(c) are received by
23 the hospital.
24 53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and

13 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
14 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
15 (i)(A) not more than 3 months; or
16 (ii)(B) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
17 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
18 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
19 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
