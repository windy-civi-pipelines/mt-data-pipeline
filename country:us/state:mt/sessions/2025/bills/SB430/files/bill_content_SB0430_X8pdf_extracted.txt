force the contemnor's compliance with a court order. A contempt is criminal if the court's purpose in imposing
the penalty is to punish the contemnor for a specific act and to vindicate the authority of the court. If the penalty
imposed is incarceration, a fine, or both, the contempt is civil if the contemnor can end the incarceration or
avoid the fine by complying with a court order and is criminal if the contemnor cannot end the incarceration or
avoid the fine by complying with a court order. If the court's purpose in imposing the sanction is to attempt to
compel the contemnor's performance of an act, the court shall impose the sanction under 3-1-520 and may not
impose a sanction under 45-7-309.

represented by counsel at all stages of the trial. The trial must be limited to the determination of whether or not
the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. At the trial, the court shall
consider all the facts relevant to the issues of whether the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder. If the
court determines that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder, the court shall then determine whether
the respondent requires commitment. In determining whether the respondent requires commitment and the
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – SB 430
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 430
appropriate disposition under 53-21-127, the court shall consider the following:
(a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the
respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;
(b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an
omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;
(c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent
or to others because of the respondent's acts or omissions; and
(d) whether the respondent's mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent's recent acts or
omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent's mental condition to the point
at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the
respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety. Predictability may be established by
the respondent's relevant medical history.
(2) The standard of proof in a hearing held pursuant to this section is proof beyond a reasonable
doubt with respect to any physical facts or evidence and clear and convincing evidence as to all other matters.
However, the respondent's mental disorder must be proved to a reasonable medical certainty. Imminent threat
of self-inflicted injury or injury to others must be proved by overt acts or omissions, sufficiently recent in time as
to be material and relevant as to the respondent's present condition.
(3) The professional person appointed by the court must be present for the trial and subject to
cross-examination. The professional person's presence may be accomplished by the use of two-way electronic
audio-video communication. The trial is governed by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. However, if the
issues are tried by a jury, at least two-thirds of the jurors shall concur on a finding that the respondent is
suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. The written report of the professional person that
indicates the professional person's diagnosis may be attached to the petition, but any matter otherwise
inadmissible, such as hearsay matter, is not admissible merely because it is contained in the report. The court
may order the trial closed to the public for the protection of the respondent.
(4) The professional person may testify as to the ultimate issue of whether the respondent is
suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. This testimony is insufficient unless accompanied
by evidence from the professional person or others that:

(b) the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an omission,
caused self-injury or injury to others;
(c) because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat danger of injury to the respondent or
to others because of the respondent's acts or omissions; or
(d) (i) the respondent's mental disorder:
(A) has resulted in recent acts, omissions, or behaviors that create difficulty in protecting the
respondent's life or health;
(B) is treatable, with a reasonable prospect of success;
(C) has resulted in the respondent's refusing or being unable to consent to voluntary admission for
treatment; and
(ii) will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent's mental condition to the
point at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the
respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety. Predictability may be established by
the respondent's relevant medical history; or
(e) whether an emergency situation as defined in 53-21-102 exists.
(5) The court, upon the showing of good cause and when it is in the best interests of the
respondent, may order a change of venue.
(6) An individual with a primary diagnosis of a mental disorder who also has a co-occurring
diagnosis of chemical dependency may satisfy criteria for commitment under this part.

commitment and the appropriate disposition under 53-21-127, the court shall consider the following:

Section 8:
Section 6. Section 53-21-127, MCA, is amended to read:
"53-21-127. (Temporary) Posttrial disposition. (1) If, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent
is not suffering from a mental disorder or does not require commitment within the meaning of this part, the
respondent must be discharged and the petition dismissed.
(2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
respondent.
(3) (a) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
the court shall:
(a)(i) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
(b)(ii) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
(i)(A) not more than 3 months; or
(ii)(B) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
in 53-21-190; or
(c)(ii) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
(i)(A) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
established in administrative rules of the department; and
(ii)(B) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – SB 430
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 430
for admission.
(b) The court may not commit the respondent to a private mental health facility or hospital without
the express consent of the facility or hospital.
(4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii) (3)(a)(ii)(A), a treatment ordered pursuant to this

Section 9:
section may not affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
(5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
treatment.
(6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
(7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon on any of the criterion criteria provided in 53-21-126(1)(d),
the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b) (3)(a)(ii), and may
not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – SB 430
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 430
nursing care center.
(8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall attest that the court has not
relied solely on the criteria provided in 53-21-126(1)(d) and shall make the following findings of fact:
(a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
(b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
(c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
(d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
respondent;
(e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
supervision of the respondent's treatment;
(f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
chosen from among other alternatives;
(g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
(h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
(i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
(ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
(iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
(i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
from among other alternatives.
(9) Any mental health evaluation report of a professional person who evaluated the respondent or
patient in connection with the commitment must be filed under seal at the time of the filing of the court's order
but must be made available to the mental health facility to which the respondent or patient is committed.

69th Legislature 2025 SB 430
53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and
the petition dismissed if, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent:
(a) is not suffering from a mental disorder;
(b) does not require commitment within the meaning of this part; or
(c) is suffering from a mental disorder but the respondent's primary diagnosis is Alzheimer's
disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).
(2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
respondent.
(3) (a) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
the court shall:
(a) (i) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
(b)(ii) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
(i)(A) not more than 3 months; or
(ii)(B) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
in 53-21-190; or
(c)(iii) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – SB 430
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 430
(i)(A) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
established in administrative rules of the department; and
(ii)(B) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
for admission.
(b) The court may not commit the respondent to a private mental health facility or hospital without
the express consent of the facility or hospital.
(4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii) (3)(a)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section
may not affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
(5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
treatment.
(6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
(7) Except as provided in 53-21-126(7), satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1)
justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter. However, if the court relies solely on any of the criterion criteria
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – SB 430
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 430
provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include
a category D assisted living facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in
subsection (3)(b) (3)(a)(ii), and may not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient
facility, or the Montana mental health nursing care center.
(8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall attest that the court has not
relied solely on the criteria provided in 53-21-126(1)(d) and shall make the following findings of fact:
(a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
(b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
(c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
(d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
respondent;
(e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
supervision of the respondent's treatment;
(f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
chosen from among other alternatives;
(g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
(h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
(i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
(ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
(iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
(i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
from among other alternatives.
(9) Any mental health evaluation report of a professional person who evaluated the respondent or

appropriate disposition under 53-21-127, the court shall consider the following:
(a) whether the respondent, because of a mental disorder, is substantially unable to provide for the
respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety;
(b) whether the respondent has recently, because of a mental disorder and through an act or an
omission, caused self-injury or injury to others;
(c) whether, because of a mental disorder, there is an imminent threat of injury to the respondent
or to others because of the respondent's acts or omissions; and
(d) whether the respondent's mental disorder, as demonstrated by the respondent's recent acts or
omissions, will, if untreated, predictably result in deterioration of the respondent's mental condition to the point
at which the respondent will become a danger to self or to others or will be unable to provide for the
respondent's own basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, or safety. Predictability may be established by
the respondent's relevant medical history.
(2) The standard of proof in a hearing held pursuant to this section is proof beyond a reasonable
doubt with respect to any physical facts or evidence and clear and convincing evidence as to all other matters.
However, the respondent's mental disorder must be proved to a reasonable medical certainty. Imminent threat
of self-inflicted injury or injury to others must be proved by overt acts or omissions, sufficiently recent in time as
to be material and relevant as to the respondent's present condition.
(3) The professional person appointed by the court must be present for the trial and subject to
cross-examination. The professional person's presence may be accomplished by the use of two-way electronic
audio-video communication. The trial is governed by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. However, if the
issues are tried by a jury, at least two-thirds of the jurors shall concur on a finding that the respondent is
suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. The written report of the professional person that
indicates the professional person's diagnosis may be attached to the petition, but any matter otherwise
inadmissible, such as hearsay matter, is not admissible merely because it is contained in the report. The court
may order the trial closed to the public for the protection of the respondent.
(4) The professional person may testify as to the ultimate issue of whether the respondent is
suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment. This testimony is insufficient unless accompanied
by evidence from the professional person or others that:

"53-21-127. (Temporary) Posttrial disposition. (1) If, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent
is not suffering from a mental disorder or does not require commitment within the meaning of this part, the
respondent must be discharged and the petition dismissed.
(2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
respondent.
(3) (a) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
the court shall:
(a)(i) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
(b)(ii) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
(i)(A) not more than 3 months; or
(ii)(B) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
in 53-21-190; or
(c)(ii) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
(i)(A) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
established in administrative rules of the department; and
(ii)(B) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time

for admission.
(b) The court may not commit the respondent to a private mental health facility or hospital without
the express consent of the facility or hospital.
(4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii) (3)(a)(ii)(A), a treatment ordered pursuant to this
section may not affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
(5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
treatment.
(6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
(7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon on any of the criterion criteria provided in 53-21-126(1)(d),
the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b) (3)(a)(ii), and may
not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health

(8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall attest that the court has not
relied solely on the criteria provided in 53-21-126(1)(d) and shall make the following findings of fact:
(a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
(b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
(c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
(d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
respondent;
(e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
supervision of the respondent's treatment;
(f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
chosen from among other alternatives;
(g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
(h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
(i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
(ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
(iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
(i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
from among other alternatives.
(9) Any mental health evaluation report of a professional person who evaluated the respondent or
patient in connection with the commitment must be filed under seal at the time of the filing of the court's order
but must be made available to the mental health facility to which the respondent or patient is committed.
