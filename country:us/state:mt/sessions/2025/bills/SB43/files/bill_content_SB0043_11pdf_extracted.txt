18 extended its order to affect nonparties, such as in McLaughlin v. Montana State Legislature, 2021 MT 120, 404
19 Mont. 166, 489 P.3d 482, in which it vacated a subpoena issued by a nonparty, and State of Montana ex rel.
20 Montanans for the Preservation of Citizen's Rights v. Waltermire, 231 Mont. 406, 757 P.2d 746 (1988), in which
21 it imposed a decision against the proponents of one voter initiative against the nonparty proponents of another;
22 and
23 WHEREAS, placing this rule in statute would remind the courts of the foundational nature of this
24 principle; and
25 WHEREAS, it is also a basic rule of law that, in general, the scope of an injunction should not exceed
26 the scope required to enforce the court's order; and
27 WHEREAS, the Legislature has decided to embody this basic rule of law in statute.
