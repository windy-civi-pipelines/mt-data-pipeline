13 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Short title. [Sections 1 through 8] may be cited as the "Social Media
14 Youth Protection Act".
15
16 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares that:
17 (1) the state has a compelling interest in safeguarding the well-being and privacy of minors
18 in the state;
19 (2) the state has enacted safeguards around products and activities that pose risks to minors,
20 including regulations on motor vehicles, medications, and products and services targeted to children;
21 (3) minors are particularly vulnerable to manipulation by the use of curation algorithms and the
22 engagement-driven design elements of social media companies;
23 (4) a minor's excessive use of an algorithmically curated social media service is likely to cause
24 adverse mental health outcomes, regardless of the content being viewed;
25 (5) the addictive design features of certain social media services contribute to excessive use of a

69th Legislature 2025 HB 925.1
1 health of minors, including increased rates of anxiety, depression, and social isolation;
2 (7) the proliferation of social media services has led to the widespread collection and utilization of
3 personal information, exposing minors to potential harms related to privacy and identity;

7 insufficient;
8 (10) the state has a compelling interest to protect minors from the adverse outcomes linked to the
9 excessive use of algorithmically curated social media services; and
10 (11) the state should ensure that minors' personal data is given special protection, as minors may
