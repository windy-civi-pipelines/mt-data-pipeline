19 department may set priorities to limit, reduce, or otherwise curtail the amount, scope, or duration of the medical
20 services made available under the Montana medicaid program after taking into consideration the funding
21 principles set forth in subsection (2). (Subsection (3)(o) terminates September 30, 2025--sec. 1, Ch. 298, L.
