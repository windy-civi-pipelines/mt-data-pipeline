25 (12) The chair shall decide points of order.
26 (13) The privileges of committee members, present physically or remotely, include the following:

22 meetings, visitors may not speak unless called upon by the chair. Restrictions on time available for testimony
23 may be announced.
24 (4) The number of people in a committee room may not exceed the maximum posted by the State Fire

28 must be operated. Cell phone use is at the discretion of the chair.

20 (2) After legislation is submitted for introduction, sponsors may be added on motion of the chief sponsor
21 at any time prior to a standing committee report on the bill or resolution. Forms for adding sponsors will be
22 supplied on request by the Secretary of the Senate.
23 (3) Upon passage of the motion, the names of the additional sponsors will be printed in the journal and

13 of an unamended bill is available.
14 (3) The majority leader shall arrange legislation on the agenda in the order in which the bills will be
15 considered, unless otherwise ordered by the Senate or Committee of the Whole.

11 S50-30. Limitations on debate. A Senator may not speak more than twice on any one motion or
12 question without unanimous consent of the Senate, unless the Senator has introduced or proposed the motion

15 who has not spoken.

6 (j) to amend;
7 (k) subject to subsection (1)(l), to postpone indefinitely; and
8 (l) to postpone indefinitely on a bill or resolution after its failure to receive a majority of those present
9 and voting on second reading.
10 (2) The motions listed in subsection (1) have precedence in the order listed.
11 (3) Subject to subsection (1)(l), a question may be indefinitely postponed by a majority roll call of all
12 Senators physically or remotely present and voting. When a bill or resolution is postponed indefinitely after
13 debate on second reading, it is finally rejected and may not be acted upon again except upon a motion of
14 reconsideration as provided in S50-90.
15 (4) A motion or proposition on a subject different from that under consideration may not be accepted
16 unless a substitute motion is in order.
17 (5) The presiding officer shall recognize the majority leader or the minority leader at any time, except
18 during the period between the close on a motion and the vote.

12 (14) all incidental motions, such as motions relating to voting or other questions of a general procedural
13 nature.
14 S50-70. Amending motions -- restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (2), no more than one
15 amendment and no more than one substitute motion may be made to a motion. This rule permits the main
16 motion and two modifying motions.
17 (2) A motion for a call of the Senate, for the previous question, to table, or to take from the table may
18 not be amended.
19 S50-80. Previous question. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the effect of calling for the
20 previous question, if adopted, is to close debate immediately, to prevent the offering of amendments or other
21 subsidiary motions, and to bring to vote promptly the immediately pending main question and the adhering
22 subsidiary motions, whether on appeal or otherwise. The motion for the previous question is nondebatable as
23 provided in S50-60(7).
24 (2) When the previous question is ordered on any debatable question on which there has been no
25 debate, the question may be debated for one-half hour, one-half of that time to be given to the proponents and
26 one-half to the opponents. The sponsor of the main motion on which the previous question is adopted may
27 close on the motion regardless of whether debate on the main motion has occurred.
28 (3) A call of the Senate is not in order after the previous question is ordered unless it appears upon an
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Josh Kassmier - (S) Rules
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.002
1 actual count by the presiding officer that a quorum is not physically and remotely present.
2 S50-90. Reconsideration -- time restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (6), any Senator may, on the
3 day the vote was taken or on the next day the Senate is in session, move to reconsider the question. A motion
4 to reconsider is a debatable motion, but the debate is limited to the motion. The debate on a motion to
5 reconsider may not address the substance of the matter for which reconsideration is sought. However, an
6 inquiry may be made concerning the purpose of the motion to reconsider.
7 (2) A motion to reconsider must be disposed of when made unless a proper substitute motion is made
8 and adopted.
9 (3) A motion to recall a bill from the House of Representatives constitutes notice to reconsider and must
10 be acted on as a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider or to recall a bill from the House of
11 Representatives may be made only under Order of Business No. 9 and, under that order of business, takes
12 precedence over all motions except motions to recess or adjourn.
13 (4) When a motion to reconsider is laid on the table, a two-thirds majority is required to take it from the
14 table. When a motion to reconsider fails, the question is finally and conclusively settled.
15 (5) If a motion to reconsider third reading action is carried, there may not be further action until the
16 succeeding legislative day.
17 (6) If the Senate has adjourned for more than 2 days, then a motion to reconsider action taken on the
18 last day the Senate was in session is in order on the day the Senate reconvenes or on the following legislative
19 day.
20 S50-95. Rereferral. (1) Legislation that is in the possession of the Senate and that has been reported
21 from a committee with a do pass or be concurred in recommendation may be rereferred to a Senate committee
22 by a majority vote.
23 (2) (a) With the consent of the majority leader, the minority leader, and the bill sponsor, legislation that
24 has passed second reading, has been rereferred to the Finance and Claims Committee pursuant to subsection
25 (1), and is reported from committee without amendments may be placed on third reading.
26 (b) The third-reading agenda must specify that the legislation rereferred and reported from committee
27 under subsection (2)(a) was rereferred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee and reported from the
28 committee without amendments as passed on second reading.

69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.002
1 (3) The individual making the rereferral motion shall announce the bill number, short bill title, and the
2 name of the sponsor of the bill immediately before it may be considered for rereferral.
3 S50-100. Dividing a question -- segregation excluded. A Senator may request to divide a question if
4 it includes two or more propositions so distinct in substance that if one thing is taken away a substantive
5 question will remain. A vote is not required on a request to divide a question, but the chair may rule that a
6 question is not divisible. The ruling of the chair may be appealed as provided in S20-10 and S20-20. For an
7 appeal of a ruling of the presiding officer, the question for the Senate must be stated as, "Shall the ruling of the
8 chair be upheld?". A motion to segregate pursuant to S50-140(4) is not a request to divide a question.
9 S50-110. Rules for questions or bills requiring other than a majority vote. (1) Except as provided
10 in subsection (2), if a question or bill requires more than a majority vote for final passage, a majority vote is
11 sufficient to decide any question relating to the question or bill prior to third reading.
12 (2) Any vote in the Senate on a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana Constitution under
13 circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-thirds vote of
14 the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote. This rule does not
15 prevent a committee from indefinitely postponing or tabling a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana
16 Constitution.
17 (3) If a bill has been amended in the House of Representatives and the amendments are accepted by
18 the Senate, the bill must again be placed on third reading in the Senate to determine if the required number of
19 votes has been cast.
20 S50-120. Committee reports to Senate -- reconsideration. (1) Reports of standing committees must
21 be read on Order of Business No. 2, and, if there is no objection to form, are considered adopted. Subject to
22 subsection (4), debate may not be had on any report.
23 (2) On an adverse committee report, the sponsor may respond to the chair of the committee making the
24 report.
25 (3) Any Senator seeking a reconsideration of the Senate's action on the adoption of a committee report
26 shall do so on Order of Business No. 9 by motion to reconsider as provided in S50-90. Any Senator may make
27 the reconsideration motion and need not have voted on the prevailing side. This rule applies notwithstanding
28 any joint rule to the contrary. Subject to S50-90(6), the reconsideration motion must be made within 1 legislative

6 Committee by the Committee of the Whole.
7 S50-130. Conference committee -- reports. (1) When a conference committee report is filed with the
8 Secretary of the Senate, the report must be read under Order of Business No. 3, select committees, and placed
9 on the calendar the succeeding legislative day for consideration on second reading. If recommended favorably
10 by the Committee of the Whole, it may be considered on third reading the same legislative day.
11 (2) If both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopt the same conference committee report
12 on legislation requiring more than a majority vote for final passage, the Senate, following approval of the
13 conference committee report on third reading, shall place the final form of the legislation on third reading to
14 determine if the required vote is obtained.
15 (3) If the Senate rejects a conference committee report, the committee continues to exist unless
16 dissolved by the President Committee on Committees or by motion. The committee may file a subsequent
17 report.
18 (4) A Senate conference committee may confer regarding matters assigned to it with any House
19 conference committee with like jurisdiction and submit recommendations for consideration of the Senate.
20 S50-135. Adjournment sine die. (1) Subject to Article V, section 10(5), of the Montana Constitution, a
21 Senator may move that the Senate adjourn for the session.
22 (2) (a) The motion is debatable and may be made under any order of business except Order of
23 Business No. 7.
24 (b) Debate on the motion is limited to two proponents and two opponents.
25 S50-140. Second reading -- Committee of the Whole report -- segregation -- rejection. (1) The
26 Senate may resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole for consideration of business on second reading, by
27 approval of a motion for that purpose.
28 (2) After a Committee of the Whole has been formed, the President shall appoint a chair to preside.

2 sponsor shall make an opening statement, proposed amendments must be considered, and then the bill must
3 be considered in its entirety.
4 (4) Prior to adoption of the Committee of the Whole report, a Senator may move to segregate
5 legislation. If the motion prevails, the legislation remains on second reading.
6 (5) When a Committee of the Whole report on legislation is rejected, the legislation remains on second
7 reading.
8 S50-150. Committee of the Whole amendments. (1) All Committee of the Whole amendments must
9 be prepared by the staff of the Legislative Services Division, stipulating the date and time of preparation and
10 staff approval, and delivered to the Secretary of the Senate for reading before the amendment is voted on.
11 (2) Each amendment, rejected or adopted, must be referenced in the journal, along with the name of
12 the sponsor and the vote on each.

28 shall issue a standing committee report.
