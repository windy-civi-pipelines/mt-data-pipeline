19 S40-20. Introduction -- first reading. (1) Upon receiving a bill or resolution from a Senator, the
20 Secretary of the Senate shall assign an appropriate sequential number, which constitutes introduction of the
21 legislation. Legislation properly introduced or received in the Senate must be announced across the rostrum
22 and public notice provided. This announcement constitutes first reading, and no debate or motion is in order
23 except that a Senator may question adherence to rules. Acknowledgment by the Secretary of the Senate of
24 receipt of legislation transmitted from the House commences the time limit for consideration of the legislation.
25 All legislation received by the Senate may be referred to a committee prior to being read across the rostrum.
26 (2) Bills and resolutions preintroduced as provided in Joint Rule 40-40 may be assigned to committee
27 by the President, posted online, and printed prior to the legislative session. The Legislative Services Division is

- 15 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature 2025 SR 5.1
1 legislation to the Secretary of the Senate.
2 (3) Upon referral to committee by the President, the Secretary of the Senate shall publicly post a listing
3 of the bill or resolution by a summary of its title, together with a notation of the committee to which it has been
4 assigned.
5 (4) The sponsor may ask the Legislative Services Division to change or correct a short title used on the
6 bill status system.
7 S40-30. Cosponsors and additional sponsors. (1) Prior to submitting legislation to the Secretary of
8 the Senate for introduction, the chief sponsor may add representatives and senators as cosponsors. A
9 legislator shall sign the cosponsor form attached to the legislation in order to be added as a cosponsor.
10 (2) After legislation is submitted for introduction, sponsors may be added on motion of the chief sponsor
11 at any time prior to a standing committee report on the bill or resolution. Forms for adding sponsors will be
12 supplied on request by the Secretary of the Senate.
13 (3) Upon passage of the motion, the names of the additional sponsors will be printed in the journal and
14 the form containing the signatures of the additional sponsors will be forwarded to the Legislative Services
15 Division with the original bill for the inclusion of the names in subsequent printings of the bill or resolution.
16 S40-40. Reading limitations. (1) Every bill must be read three times prior to passage, either by title or
17 by summary of title as provided in these rules.
18 (2) A bill or resolution may not have more than one reading on the same day except the last legislative
19 day.
20 (3) An amendment may not be offered on third reading.
21 S40-60. Scheduling for second reading. (1) All bills and resolutions that have been reported by a

24 (2) Until the 50th legislative day, 1 day must elapse between receiving the legislation from printing and
25 scheduling for second reading for consideration by Committee of the Whole unless a posted or printed version
26 of an unamended bill is available.
27 (3) The majority leader shall arrange legislation on the agenda in the order in which the bills will be
28 considered, unless otherwise ordered by the Senate or Committee of the Whole.

4 leader, or minority leader, Senators must be physically present every sitting of the Senate and shall vote on
5 questions put before the Senate.
6 (2) A majority of the Senate shall constitute a quorum to do business, but a smaller number may
7 adjourn from day to day and compel the attendance of absent Senators, in the manner and under penalties as

24 S50-30. Limitations on debate. A Senator may not speak more than twice on any one motion or
25 question without unanimous consent of the Senate, unless the Senator has introduced or proposed the motion
26 or question under debate, in which case the Senator may speak twice and also close the debate. However, a
27 Senator who has spoken may not speak again on the same motion or question to the exclusion of a Senator
28 who has not spoken.
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature 2025 SR 5.1
1 S50-40. Procedure upon offering a motion. (1) When a motion is offered it must be restated by the
2 presiding officer. If requested by the presiding officer or a Senator, it must be reduced to writing, presented at
3 the rostrum, and read aloud by the Secretary.
4 (2) A motion may be withdrawn by the Senator offering it at any time before it is amended or voted
5 upon.
6 (3) A motion is carried by a majority of the Senate present and voting unless otherwise stated in the
7 Senate Rules.
8 S50-50. Precedence of motions. (1) When a question is under debate only the following privileged
9 and subsidiary motions may be made:
10 (a) to adjourn for the day (nondebatable S50-60);
11 (b) to adjourn sine die (debatable S50-135);
12 (c) for a call of the Senate (nondebatable S50-60);
13 (d) to recess (nondebatable S50-60);
14 (e) question of privilege;
15 (f) to lay on the table (nondebatable S50-60);

17 (h) to postpone to a certain day;
18 (i) to refer or commit;
19 (j) to amend;
20 (k) subject to subsection (1)(l), to postpone indefinitely; and
21 (l) to postpone indefinitely on a bill or resolution after its failure to receive a majority of those present
22 and voting on second reading.
23 (2) The motions listed in subsection (1) have precedence in the order listed.
24 (3) Subject to subsection (1)(l), a question may be indefinitely postponed by a majority roll call of all
25 Senators physically or remotely present and voting. When a bill or resolution is postponed indefinitely after
26 debate on second reading, it is finally rejected and may not be acted upon again except upon a motion of
27 reconsideration as provided in S50-90.
28 (4) A motion or proposition on a subject different from that under consideration may not be accepted
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature 2025 SR 5.1
1 unless a substitute motion is in order.
2 S50-60. Nondebatable motions. The following motions are not debatable:
3 (1) to adjourn for the day;
4 (2) for a call of the Senate;
5 (3) to recess or rise;
6 (4) for parliamentary inquiry;
7 (5) for suspension of the rules;
8 (6) to lay on the table;
9 (7) for the previous question;
10 (8) to limit, extend the limits of, or to close debate;
11 (9) to amend an undebatable motion;
12 (10) to change a vote (S50-200);
13 (11) to pass business in Committee of the Whole;
14 (12) to take from the table;
15 (13) a decision of the presiding officer, unless appealed or unless the presiding officer submits the
16 question to the Senate for advice or decision; and
17 (14) all incidental motions, such as motions relating to voting or other questions of a general procedural
18 nature.
19 S50-70. Amending motions -- restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (2), no more than one
20 amendment and no more than one substitute motion may be made to a motion. This rule permits the main
21 motion and two modifying motions.
22 (2) A motion for a call of the Senate, for the previous question, to table, or to take from the table may
23 not be amended.
24 S50-80. Previous question. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the effect of calling for the
25 previous question, if adopted, is to close debate immediately, to prevent the offering of amendments or other
26 subsidiary motions, and to bring to vote promptly the immediately pending main question and the adhering
27 subsidiary motions, whether on appeal or otherwise. The motion for the previous question is nondebatable as
28 provided in S50-60(7).
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature 2025 SR 5.1
1 (2) When the previous question is ordered on any debatable question on which there has been no
2 debate, the question may be debated for one-half hour, one-half of that time to be given to the proponents and
3 one-half to the opponents. The sponsor of the main motion on which the previous question is adopted may
4 close on the motion regardless of whether debate on the main motion has occurred.
5 (3) A call of the Senate is not in order after the previous question is ordered unless it appears upon an
6 actual count by the presiding officer that a quorum is not physically and remotely present.
7 S50-90. Reconsideration -- time restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (6), any Senator may, on the
8 day the vote was taken or on the next day the Senate is in session, move to reconsider the question. A motion
9 to reconsider is a debatable motion, but the debate is limited to the motion. The debate on a motion to
10 reconsider may not address the substance of the matter for which reconsideration is sought. However, an
11 inquiry may be made concerning the purpose of the motion to reconsider.
12 (2) A motion to reconsider must be disposed of when made unless a proper substitute motion is made
13 and adopted.
14 (3) A motion to recall a bill from the House of Representatives constitutes notice to reconsider and must
15 be acted on as a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider or to recall a bill from the House of
16 Representatives may be made only under Order of Business No. 9 and, under that order of business, takes
17 precedence over all motions except motions to recess or adjourn.
18 (4) When a motion to reconsider is laid on the table, a two-thirds majority is required to take it from the
19 table. When a motion to reconsider fails, the question is finally and conclusively settled.
20 (5) If a motion to reconsider third reading action is carried, there may not be further action until the
21 succeeding legislative day.
22 (6) If the Senate has adjourned for more than 2 days, then a motion to reconsider action taken on the
23 last day the Senate was in session is in order on the day the Senate reconvenes or on the following legislative
24 day.
25 S50-95. Rereferral. (1) Legislation that is in the possession of the Senate and that has been reported
26 from a committee with a do pass or be concurred in recommendation may be rereferred to a Senate committee
27 by a majority vote.
28 (2) (a) With the consent of the majority leader, the minority leader, and the bill sponsor, legislation that
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature 2025 SR 5.1
1 has passed second reading, has been rereferred to the Finance and Claims Committee pursuant to subsection
2 (1), and is reported from committee without amendments may be placed on third reading.
3 (b) The third-reading agenda must specify that the legislation rereferred and reported from committee
4 under subsection (2)(a) was rereferred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee and reported from the
5 committee without amendments as passed on second reading.
6 (3) The individual making the rereferral motion shall announce the bill number, short bill title, and the
7 name of the sponsor of the bill immediately before it may be considered for rereferral.
8 S50-100. Dividing a question -- segregation excluded. A Senator may request to divide a question if
9 it includes two or more propositions so distinct in substance that if one thing is taken away a substantive
10 question will remain. A vote is not required on a request to divide a question, but the chair may rule that a
11 question is not divisible. The ruling of the chair may be appealed as provided in S20-10 and S20-20. For an
12 appeal of a ruling of the presiding officer, the question for the Senate must be stated as, "Shall the ruling of the
13 chair be upheld?". A motion to segregate pursuant to S50-140(4) is not a request to divide a question.
14 S50-110. Rules for questions or bills requiring other than a majority vote. (1) Except as provided
15 in subsection (2), if a question or bill requires more than a majority vote for final passage, a majority vote is
16 sufficient to decide any question relating to the question or bill prior to third reading.
17 (2) Any vote in the Senate on a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana Constitution under
18 circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-thirds vote of
19 the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote. This rule does not
20 prevent a committee from indefinitely postponing or tabling a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana
21 Constitution.
22 (3) If a bill has been amended in the House of Representatives and the amendments are accepted by
23 the Senate, the bill must again be placed on third reading in the Senate to determine if the required number of
24 votes has been cast.
25 S50-120. Committee reports to Senate -- reconsideration. (1) Reports of standing committees must
26 be read on Order of Business No. 2, and, if there is no objection to form, are considered adopted. Subject to
27 subsection (4), debate may not be had on any report.
28 (2) On an adverse committee report, the sponsor may respond to the chair of the committee making the
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature 2025 SR 5.1
1 report.
2 (3) Any Senator seeking a reconsideration of the Senate's action on the adoption of a committee report
3 shall do so on Order of Business No. 9 by motion to reconsider as provided in S50-90. Any Senator may make
4 the reconsideration motion and need not have voted on the prevailing side. This rule applies notwithstanding
5 any joint rule to the contrary. Subject to S50-90(6), the reconsideration motion must be made within 1 legislative
6 day of the adoption of the committee report and is not in order if the bill has been considered in Committee of
7 the Whole.
8 (4) (a) Subject to subsection (4)(b), the Rules Committee and conference committees may report at any
9 time, except during a call of the Senate, when a vote is being taken, or during Committee of the Whole.
10 (b) The Rules Committee may report during Committee of the Whole on matters referred to the
11 Committee by the Committee of the Whole.
12 S50-130. Conference committee -- reports. (1) When a conference committee report is filed with the
13 Secretary of the Senate, the report must be read under Order of Business No. 3, select committees, and placed
14 on the calendar the succeeding legislative day for consideration on second reading. If recommended favorably
15 by the Committee of the Whole, it may be considered on third reading the same legislative day.
16 (2) If both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopt the same conference committee report
17 on legislation requiring more than a majority vote for final passage, the Senate, following approval of the
18 conference committee report on third reading, shall place the final form of the legislation on third reading to
19 determine if the required vote is obtained.
20 (3) If the Senate rejects a conference committee report, the committee continues to exist unless
21 dissolved by the President or by motion. The committee may file a subsequent report.
22 (4) A Senate conference committee may confer regarding matters assigned to it with any House
23 conference committee with like jurisdiction and submit recommendations for consideration of the Senate.
24 S50-135. Adjournment sine die. (1) Subject to Article V, section 10(5), of the Montana Constitution, a
25 Senator may move that the Senate adjourn for the session.
26 (2) (a) The motion is debatable and may be made under any order of business except Order of
27 Business No. 7.
28 (b) Debate on the motion is limited to two proponents and two opponents.
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature 2025 SR 5.1
1 S50-140. Second reading -- Committee of the Whole report -- segregation -- rejection. (1) The
2 Senate may resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole for consideration of business on second reading, by
3 approval of a motion for that purpose.
4 (2) After a Committee of the Whole has been formed, the President shall appoint a chair to preside.
5 (3) All legislation considered in the Committee of the Whole must be read by a summary of its title. The
6 sponsor shall make an opening statement, proposed amendments must be considered, and then the bill must
7 be considered in its entirety.
8 (4) Prior to adoption of the Committee of the Whole report, a Senator may move to segregate
9 legislation. If the motion prevails, the legislation remains on second reading.
10 (5) When a Committee of the Whole report on legislation is rejected, the legislation remains on second
11 reading.
12 S50-150. Committee of the Whole amendments. (1) All Committee of the Whole amendments must
13 be prepared by the staff of the Legislative Services Division, stipulating the date and time of preparation and
14 staff approval, and delivered to the Secretary of the Senate for reading before the amendment is voted on.
15 (2) Each amendment, rejected or adopted, must be referenced in the journal, along with the name of
16 the sponsor and the vote on each.
17 S50-160. Motions in Committee of the Whole. (1) All proper motions on second reading are

7 S50-170. Committee of the Whole -- generally. (1) The Committee of the Whole may not appoint
8 subcommittees.
9 (2) The Committee of the Whole may not punish its members for misconduct, but may report disorder
10 to the Senate.
11 S50-180. Voting on second reading -- positive disposition of motions. (1) On Order of Business
12 No. 7, in addition to other methods, a recorded vote may be made in the following manner: the chair may call
13 for a voice vote to accept or reject a question. If the vote is other than unanimous, the chair may ask that the
14 lesser number on the question indicate their vote by an approved method of counting votes. The Secretary will
15 then record the vote. The chair may then rule that unless excused those of the greater number and physically
16 or remotely present have voted on the prevailing side of the question and that their vote be recorded as voting
17 on the prevailing side. If there was a unanimous voice vote, all those physically or remotely present will be
18 recorded as having voted for the question.
19 (2) A motion on second reading must be disposed of by a positive vote.
20 S50-190. Third reading procedure. (1) Unless rereferred to a committee by a majority vote after the

1 pause the presiding officer asks "Has every member voted?" (reasonable pause), "Does any member wish to
2 change his or her vote?" (reasonable pause), "The Secretary will record the vote."

4 request of two Senators, if the request occurs before the vote is taken.
5 (2) On a roll call vote the names of the Senators must be called alphabetically, unless an electronic

7 not explain a vote until after the decision is announced from the chair.
8 (3) A Senator may move to change the Senator's vote, on any recorded vote, within 1 legislative day of

22 (4) The absentee vote authorization may be revoked before the vote by the member who signed the
23 authorization.
24 (5) Absentee voting is not allowed on third reading.
25 S50-220. Call of the Senate without a quorum. (1) In the absence of a quorum, a majority of
26 Senators physically and remotely present may compel the attendance of absent Senators by ordering a call of
27 the Senate. A call of the Senate is not in order if a majority of Senators are physically and remotely present.
28 (2) On a call of the Senate, a Senator who refuses to attend may be arrested by the Sergeant-at-Arms

8 committee chair or other member of the Senate to introduce the simple resolution.

23 request a separate committee resolution.

4 committee takes action on the separate resolution. After the committee's executive action, the committee chair
5 shall issue a standing committee report.
6 (5) The Secretary will read the reports under Order of Business No. 2, reports of standing committees.
7 (6) After the report has been read, the resolution must be placed on Order of Business No. 7 the next
8 legislative day for consideration by the Senate. Motions to approve or disapprove of the resolution are in order
9 and may be debated. Approval upon second reading constitutes confirmation of the Governor's nominee. A
10 motion to reconsider the approval or disapproval of a nomination made on second reading must occur within
11 one legislative day. A motion to reconsider may not be made if the resolution approving a confirmation is no

5 (4) The sponsor may ask the Legislative Services Division to change or correct a short title used on the
6 bill status system.
7 S40-30. Cosponsors and additional sponsors. (1) Prior to submitting legislation to the Secretary of
8 the Senate for introduction, the chief sponsor may add representatives and senators as cosponsors. A
9 legislator shall sign the cosponsor form attached to the legislation in order to be added as a cosponsor.
10 (2) After legislation is submitted for introduction, sponsors may be added on motion of the chief sponsor
11 at any time prior to a standing committee report on the bill or resolution. Forms for adding sponsors will be
12 supplied on request by the Secretary of the Senate.
13 (3) Upon passage of the motion, the names of the additional sponsors will be printed in the journal and

28 who has not spoken.
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5

69th Legislature 2025 SR 5.1
1 S50-40. Procedure upon offering a motion. (1) When a motion is offered it must be restated by the
2 presiding officer. If requested by the presiding officer or a Senator, it must be reduced to writing, presented at
3 the rostrum, and read aloud by the Secretary.

5 upon.
6 (3) A motion is carried by a majority of the Senate present and voting unless otherwise stated in the
7 Senate Rules.

24 (3) Subject to subsection (1)(l), a question may be indefinitely postponed by a majority roll call of all
25 Senators physically or remotely present and voting. When a bill or resolution is postponed indefinitely after
26 debate on second reading, it is finally rejected and may not be acted upon again except upon a motion of
27 reconsideration as provided in S50-90.
28 (4) A motion or proposition on a subject different from that under consideration may not be accepted
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5

69th Legislature 2025 SR 5.1
1 unless a substitute motion is in order.
2 S50-60. Nondebatable motions. The following motions are not debatable:
3 (1) to adjourn for the day;
4 (2) for a call of the Senate;
5 (3) to recess or rise;
6 (4) for parliamentary inquiry;
7 (5) for suspension of the rules;
8 (6) to lay on the table;

12 (10) to change a vote (S50-200);
13 (11) to pass business in Committee of the Whole;
14 (12) to take from the table;
15 (13) a decision of the presiding officer, unless appealed or unless the presiding officer submits the
16 question to the Senate for advice or decision; and
17 (14) all incidental motions, such as motions relating to voting or other questions of a general procedural
18 nature.
19 S50-70. Amending motions -- restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (2), no more than one
20 amendment and no more than one substitute motion may be made to a motion. This rule permits the main
21 motion and two modifying motions.
22 (2) A motion for a call of the Senate, for the previous question, to table, or to take from the table may
23 not be amended.
24 S50-80. Previous question. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the effect of calling for the
25 previous question, if adopted, is to close debate immediately, to prevent the offering of amendments or other
26 subsidiary motions, and to bring to vote promptly the immediately pending main question and the adhering
27 subsidiary motions, whether on appeal or otherwise. The motion for the previous question is nondebatable as
28 provided in S50-60(7).
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5

69th Legislature 2025 SR 5.1
1 (2) When the previous question is ordered on any debatable question on which there has been no
2 debate, the question may be debated for one-half hour, one-half of that time to be given to the proponents and
3 one-half to the opponents. The sponsor of the main motion on which the previous question is adopted may
4 close on the motion regardless of whether debate on the main motion has occurred.
5 (3) A call of the Senate is not in order after the previous question is ordered unless it appears upon an
6 actual count by the presiding officer that a quorum is not physically and remotely present.
7 S50-90. Reconsideration -- time restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (6), any Senator may, on the
8 day the vote was taken or on the next day the Senate is in session, move to reconsider the question. A motion
9 to reconsider is a debatable motion, but the debate is limited to the motion. The debate on a motion to
10 reconsider may not address the substance of the matter for which reconsideration is sought. However, an
11 inquiry may be made concerning the purpose of the motion to reconsider.
12 (2) A motion to reconsider must be disposed of when made unless a proper substitute motion is made
13 and adopted.
14 (3) A motion to recall a bill from the House of Representatives constitutes notice to reconsider and must
15 be acted on as a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider or to recall a bill from the House of
16 Representatives may be made only under Order of Business No. 9 and, under that order of business, takes
17 precedence over all motions except motions to recess or adjourn.
18 (4) When a motion to reconsider is laid on the table, a two-thirds majority is required to take it from the
19 table. When a motion to reconsider fails, the question is finally and conclusively settled.
20 (5) If a motion to reconsider third reading action is carried, there may not be further action until the
21 succeeding legislative day.
22 (6) If the Senate has adjourned for more than 2 days, then a motion to reconsider action taken on the
23 last day the Senate was in session is in order on the day the Senate reconvenes or on the following legislative
24 day.
25 S50-95. Rereferral. (1) Legislation that is in the possession of the Senate and that has been reported
26 from a committee with a do pass or be concurred in recommendation may be rereferred to a Senate committee
27 by a majority vote.
28 (2) (a) With the consent of the majority leader, the minority leader, and the bill sponsor, legislation that
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5

69th Legislature 2025 SR 5.1
1 has passed second reading, has been rereferred to the Finance and Claims Committee pursuant to subsection
2 (1), and is reported from committee without amendments may be placed on third reading.
3 (b) The third-reading agenda must specify that the legislation rereferred and reported from committee
4 under subsection (2)(a) was rereferred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee and reported from the
5 committee without amendments as passed on second reading.
6 (3) The individual making the rereferral motion shall announce the bill number, short bill title, and the
7 name of the sponsor of the bill immediately before it may be considered for rereferral.
8 S50-100. Dividing a question -- segregation excluded. A Senator may request to divide a question if
9 it includes two or more propositions so distinct in substance that if one thing is taken away a substantive
10 question will remain. A vote is not required on a request to divide a question, but the chair may rule that a
11 question is not divisible. The ruling of the chair may be appealed as provided in S20-10 and S20-20. For an
12 appeal of a ruling of the presiding officer, the question for the Senate must be stated as, "Shall the ruling of the
13 chair be upheld?". A motion to segregate pursuant to S50-140(4) is not a request to divide a question.
14 S50-110. Rules for questions or bills requiring other than a majority vote. (1) Except as provided
15 in subsection (2), if a question or bill requires more than a majority vote for final passage, a majority vote is
16 sufficient to decide any question relating to the question or bill prior to third reading.
17 (2) Any vote in the Senate on a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana Constitution under
18 circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-thirds vote of
19 the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote. This rule does not
20 prevent a committee from indefinitely postponing or tabling a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana
21 Constitution.
22 (3) If a bill has been amended in the House of Representatives and the amendments are accepted by
23 the Senate, the bill must again be placed on third reading in the Senate to determine if the required number of
24 votes has been cast.
25 S50-120. Committee reports to Senate -- reconsideration. (1) Reports of standing committees must
26 be read on Order of Business No. 2, and, if there is no objection to form, are considered adopted. Subject to
27 subsection (4), debate may not be had on any report.
28 (2) On an adverse committee report, the sponsor may respond to the chair of the committee making the
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5

69th Legislature 2025 SR 5.1
1 report.
2 (3) Any Senator seeking a reconsideration of the Senate's action on the adoption of a committee report
3 shall do so on Order of Business No. 9 by motion to reconsider as provided in S50-90. Any Senator may make
4 the reconsideration motion and need not have voted on the prevailing side. This rule applies notwithstanding
5 any joint rule to the contrary. Subject to S50-90(6), the reconsideration motion must be made within 1 legislative
6 day of the adoption of the committee report and is not in order if the bill has been considered in Committee of
7 the Whole.
8 (4) (a) Subject to subsection (4)(b), the Rules Committee and conference committees may report at any
9 time, except during a call of the Senate, when a vote is being taken, or during Committee of the Whole.
10 (b) The Rules Committee may report during Committee of the Whole on matters referred to the
11 Committee by the Committee of the Whole.
12 S50-130. Conference committee -- reports. (1) When a conference committee report is filed with the
13 Secretary of the Senate, the report must be read under Order of Business No. 3, select committees, and placed
14 on the calendar the succeeding legislative day for consideration on second reading. If recommended favorably
15 by the Committee of the Whole, it may be considered on third reading the same legislative day.
16 (2) If both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopt the same conference committee report
17 on legislation requiring more than a majority vote for final passage, the Senate, following approval of the
18 conference committee report on third reading, shall place the final form of the legislation on third reading to
19 determine if the required vote is obtained.
20 (3) If the Senate rejects a conference committee report, the committee continues to exist unless
21 dissolved by the President or by motion. The committee may file a subsequent report.
22 (4) A Senate conference committee may confer regarding matters assigned to it with any House
23 conference committee with like jurisdiction and submit recommendations for consideration of the Senate.
24 S50-135. Adjournment sine die. (1) Subject to Article V, section 10(5), of the Montana Constitution, a
25 Senator may move that the Senate adjourn for the session.
26 (2) (a) The motion is debatable and may be made under any order of business except Order of
27 Business No. 7.
28 (b) Debate on the motion is limited to two proponents and two opponents.

25 nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees recommended by the committee,
26 the Senator may prepare a floor amendment to strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a
27 group of nominees is stricken, a Senator may make a motion to request that the President of the Senate submit

4 committee takes action on the separate resolution. After the committee's executive action, the committee chair
5 shall issue a standing committee report.
6 (5) The Secretary will read the reports under Order of Business No. 2, reports of standing committees.
7 (6) After the report has been read, the resolution must be placed on Order of Business No. 7 the next
8 legislative day for consideration by the Senate. Motions to approve or disapprove of the resolution are in order
9 and may be debated. Approval upon second reading constitutes confirmation of the Governor's nominee. A
10 motion to reconsider the approval or disapproval of a nomination made on second reading must occur within
11 one legislative day. A motion to reconsider may not be made if the resolution approving a confirmation is no
12 longer in the possession of the Senate.
