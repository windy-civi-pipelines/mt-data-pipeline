6 Secretary of the Senate shall assign an appropriate sequential number, which constitutes introduction of the
7 legislation. Legislation properly introduced or received in the Senate must be announced across the rostrum
8 and public notice provided. This announcement constitutes first reading, and no debate or motion is in order
9 except that a Senator may question adherence to rules. Acknowledgment by the Secretary of the Senate of
10 receipt of legislation transmitted from the House commences the time limit for consideration of the legislation.
11 All legislation received by the Senate may be referred to a committee prior to being read across the rostrum.
12 (2) Bills and resolutions preintroduced as provided in Joint Rule 40-40 may be assigned to committee

15 legislation to the Secretary of the Senate.

24 (2) After legislation is submitted for introduction, sponsors may be added on motion of the chief sponsor
25 at any time prior to a standing committee report on the bill or resolution. Forms for adding sponsors will be
26 supplied on request by the Secretary of the Senate.
27 (3) Upon passage of the motion, the names of the additional sponsors will be printed in the journal and
28 the form containing the signatures of the additional sponsors will be forwarded to the Legislative Services

14 considered, unless otherwise ordered by the Senate or Committee of the Whole.
15 CHAPTER 5
16 Floor Action
17 S50-10. Attendance -- mandatory voting -- quorum. (1) Unless excused by the President, majority
18 leader, or minority leader, Senators Except as provided in subsection (2), a Senator must be physically or
19 remotely present every sitting of the Senate and shall vote on questions put before the Senate.
20 (2) A Senator shall notify the President, majority leader, or the minority leader if the Senator will be
21 remotely present or absent for a sitting of the Senate.

12 S50-30. Limitations on debate. A Senator may not speak more than twice on any one motion or
13 question without unanimous consent of the Senate, unless the Senator has introduced or proposed the motion
14 or question under debate, in which case the Senator may speak twice and also close the debate. However, a
15 Senator who has spoken may not speak again on the same motion or question to the exclusion of a Senator
16 who has not spoken.
17 S50-40. Procedure upon offering a motion. (1) When a motion is offered it must be restated by the
18 presiding officer. If requested by the presiding officer or a Senator, it must be reduced to writing, presented at
19 the rostrum, and read aloud by the Secretary.
20 (2) A motion may be withdrawn by the Senator offering it at any time before it is amended or voted
21 upon.
22 (3) A motion is carried by a majority of the Senate present and voting unless otherwise stated in the

28 (c) for a call of the Senate (nondebatable S50-60);
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
Amendment - 2nd Reading-yellow - Requested by: Tom McGillvray - (S) Committee of the
Whole
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.006
1 (d) to recess (nondebatable S50-60);

7 (j) to amend;
8 (k) subject to subsection (1)(l), to postpone indefinitely; and
9 (l) to postpone indefinitely on a bill or resolution after its failure to receive a majority of those present
10 and voting on second reading.
11 (2) The motions listed in subsection (1) have precedence in the order listed.
12 (3) Subject to subsection (1)(l), a question may be indefinitely postponed by a majority roll call of all
13 Senators physically or remotely present and voting. When a bill or resolution is postponed indefinitely after
14 debate on second reading, it is finally rejected and may not be acted upon again except upon a motion of
15 reconsideration as provided in S50-90.
16 (4) A motion or proposition on a subject different from that under consideration may not be accepted
17 unless a substitute motion is in order.

- 19 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
Amendment - 2nd Reading-yellow - Requested by: Tom McGillvray - (S) Committee of the
Whole
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.006
1 (11) to pass business in Committee of the Whole;
2 (12) to take from the table;
3 (13) a decision of the presiding officer, unless appealed or unless the presiding officer submits the
4 question to the Senate for advice or decision; and
5 (14) all incidental motions, such as motions relating to voting or other questions of a general procedural
6 nature.
7 S50-70. Amending motions -- restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (2), no more than one
8 amendment and no more than one substitute motion may be made to a motion. This rule permits the main
9 motion and two modifying motions.
10 (2) A motion for a call of the Senate, for the previous question, to table, or to take from the table may
11 not be amended.
12 S50-80. Previous question. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the effect of calling for the
13 previous question, if adopted, is to close debate immediately, to prevent the offering of amendments or other
14 subsidiary motions, and to bring to vote promptly the immediately pending main question and the adhering
15 subsidiary motions, whether on appeal or otherwise. The motion for the previous question is nondebatable as
16 provided in S50-60(7).
17 (2) When the previous question is ordered on any debatable question on which there has been no
18 debate, the question may be debated for one-half hour, one-half of that time to be given to the proponents and
19 one-half to the opponents. The sponsor of the main motion on which the previous question is adopted may
20 close on the motion regardless of whether debate on the main motion has occurred.
21 (3) A call of the Senate is not in order after the previous question is ordered unless it appears upon an
22 actual count by the presiding officer that a quorum is not physically and remotely present.
23 S50-90. Reconsideration -- time restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (6), any Senator may, on the
24 day the vote was taken or on the next day the Senate is in session, move to reconsider the question. A motion
25 to reconsider is a debatable motion, but the debate is limited to the motion. The debate on a motion to
26 reconsider may not address the substance of the matter for which reconsideration is sought. However, an
27 inquiry may be made concerning the purpose of the motion to reconsider.
28 (2) A motion to reconsider must be disposed of when made unless a proper substitute motion is made
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
Amendment - 2nd Reading-yellow - Requested by: Tom McGillvray - (S) Committee of the
Whole
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.006
1 and adopted.
2 (3) A motion to recall a bill from the House of Representatives constitutes notice to reconsider and must
3 be acted on as a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider or to recall a bill from the House of
4 Representatives may be made only under Order of Business No. 9 and, under that order of business, takes
5 precedence over all motions except motions to recess or adjourn.
6 (4) When a motion to reconsider is laid on the table, a two-thirds majority is required to take it from the
7 table. When a motion to reconsider fails, the question is finally and conclusively settled.
8 (5) If a motion to reconsider third reading action is carried, there may not be further action until the
9 succeeding legislative day.
10 (6) If the Senate has adjourned for more than 2 days, then a motion to reconsider action taken on the
11 last day the Senate was in session is in order on the day the Senate reconvenes or on the following legislative
12 day.
13 S50-95. Rereferral. (1) Legislation that is in the possession of the Senate and that has been reported
14 from a committee with a do pass or be concurred in recommendation may be rereferred to a Senate committee
15 by a majority vote.
16 (2) (a) With the consent of the majority leader, the minority leader, and the bill sponsor, legislation that
17 has passed second reading, has been rereferred to the Finance and Claims Committee pursuant to subsection
18 (1), and is reported from committee without amendments may be placed on third reading.
19 (b) The third-reading agenda must specify that the legislation rereferred and reported from committee
20 under subsection (2)(a) was rereferred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee and reported from the
21 committee without amendments as passed on second reading.
22 (3) The individual making the rereferral motion shall announce the bill number, short bill title, and the
23 name of the sponsor of the bill immediately before it may be considered for rereferral.
24 S50-100. Dividing a question -- segregation excluded. A Senator may request to divide a question if
25 it includes two or more propositions so distinct in substance that if one thing is taken away a substantive
26 question will remain. A vote is not required on a request to divide a question, but the chair may rule that a
27 question is not divisible. The ruling of the chair may be appealed as provided in S20-10 and S20-20. For an
28 appeal of a ruling of the presiding officer, the question for the Senate must be stated as, "Shall the ruling of the
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
Amendment - 2nd Reading-yellow - Requested by: Tom McGillvray - (S) Committee of the
Whole
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.006
1 chair be upheld?". A motion to segregate pursuant to S50-140(4) is not a request to divide a question.
2 S50-110. Rules for questions or bills requiring other than a majority vote. (1) Except as provided
3 in subsection (2), if a question or bill requires more than a majority vote for final passage, a majority vote is
4 sufficient to decide any question relating to the question or bill prior to third reading.
5 (2) Any vote in the Senate on a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana Constitution under
6 circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-thirds vote of
7 the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote. This rule does not
8 prevent a committee from indefinitely postponing or tabling a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana
9 Constitution.
10 (3) If a bill has been amended in the House of Representatives and the amendments are accepted by
11 the Senate, the bill must again be placed on third reading in the Senate to determine if the required number of
12 votes has been cast.
13 S50-120. Committee reports to Senate -- reconsideration. (1) Reports of standing committees must
14 be read on Order of Business No. 2, and, if there is no objection to form, are considered adopted. Subject to
15 subsection (4), debate may not be had on any report.
16 (2) On an adverse committee report, the sponsor may respond to the chair of the committee making the
17 report.
18 (3) Any Senator seeking a reconsideration of the Senate's action on the adoption of a committee report
19 shall do so on Order of Business No. 9 by motion to reconsider as provided in S50-90. Any Senator may make
20 the reconsideration motion and need not have voted on the prevailing side. This rule applies notwithstanding
21 any joint rule to the contrary. Subject to S50-90(6), the reconsideration motion must be made within 1 legislative
22 day of the adoption of the committee report and is not in order if the bill has been considered in Committee of
23 the Whole.
24 (4) (a) Subject to subsection (4)(b), the Rules Committee and conference committees may report at any
25 time, except during a call of the Senate, when a vote is being taken, or during Committee of the Whole.
26 (b) The Rules Committee may report during Committee of the Whole on matters referred to the
27 Committee by the Committee of the Whole.
28 S50-130. Conference committee -- reports. (1) When a conference committee report is filed with the

Amendment - 2nd Reading-yellow - Requested by: Tom McGillvray - (S) Committee of the
Whole
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.006
1 Secretary of the Senate, the report must be read under Order of Business No. 3, select committees, and placed
2 on the calendar the succeeding legislative day for consideration on second reading. If recommended favorably
3 by the Committee of the Whole, it may be considered on third reading the same legislative day.
4 (2) If both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopt the same conference committee report
5 on legislation requiring more than a majority vote for final passage, the Senate, following approval of the
6 conference committee report on third reading, shall place the final form of the legislation on third reading to
7 determine if the required vote is obtained.
8 (3) If the Senate rejects a conference committee report, the committee continues to exist unless
9 dissolved by the President or by motion. The committee may file a subsequent report.
10 (4) A Senate conference committee may confer regarding matters assigned to it with any House
11 conference committee with like jurisdiction and submit recommendations for consideration of the Senate.
12 S50-135. Adjournment sine die. (1) Subject to Article V, section 10(5), of the Montana Constitution, a
13 Senator may move that the Senate adjourn for the session.
14 (2) (a) The motion is debatable and may be made under any order of business except Order of
15 Business No. 7.
16 (b) Debate on the motion is limited to two proponents and two opponents.
17 S50-140. Second reading -- Committee of the Whole report -- segregation -- rejection. (1) The
18 Senate may resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole for consideration of business on second reading, by
19 approval of a motion for that purpose.
20 (2) After a Committee of the Whole has been formed, the President shall appoint a chair to preside.
21 (3) All legislation considered in the Committee of the Whole must be read by a summary of its title. The
22 sponsor shall make an opening statement, proposed amendments must be considered, and then the bill must
23 be considered in its entirety.
24 (4) Prior to adoption of the Committee of the Whole report, a Senator may move to segregate
25 legislation. If the motion prevails, the legislation remains on second reading.
26 (5) When a Committee of the Whole report on legislation is rejected, the legislation remains on second
27 reading.
28 S50-150. Committee of the Whole amendments. (1) All Committee of the Whole amendments must

3 (2) Each amendment, rejected or adopted, must be referenced in the journal, along with the name of

19 (3) The motions listed in subsection (2) may be made in descending order as listed.
20 (4) Except for the President of the Senate or designee, a Senator may not be recognized between the
21 time a bill sponsor closes on the bill and the question is called by the presiding officer with a vote taken on the
22 bill or resolution.
23 S50-170. Committee of the Whole -- generally. (1) The Committee of the Whole may not appoint
24 subcommittees.
25 (2) The Committee of the Whole may not punish its members for misconduct, but may report disorder
26 to the Senate.

28 No. 7, in addition to other methods, a recorded vote may be made in the following manner: the chair may call

Amendment - 2nd Reading-yellow - Requested by: Tom McGillvray - (S) Committee of the
Whole
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.006
1 for a voice vote to accept or reject a question. If the vote is other than unanimous, the chair may ask that the
2 lesser number on the question indicate their vote by an approved method of counting votes. The Secretary will
3 then record the vote. The chair may then rule that unless excused those of the greater number and physically
4 or remotely present have voted on the prevailing side of the question and that their vote be recorded as voting
5 on the prevailing side. If there was a unanimous voice vote, all those physically or remotely present will be
6 recorded as having voted for the question.
7 (2) A motion on second reading must be disposed of by a positive vote.
8 S50-190. Third reading procedure. (1) Unless rereferred to a committee by a majority vote after the

12 (2) On Order of Business No. 8 the Secretary shall read the title and the President shall state the
13 question as follows: "Senate bill number (or other appropriate identification)..... having been read three times,
14 the question is, shall the bill (or other appropriate identification) pass the Senate?"
15 (3) If an electronic voting system is used, the President shall state "Those in favor vote yes and those
16 opposed vote no" and the Secretary will sound the signal and open the board for voting. After a reasonable
17 pause the presiding officer asks "Has every member voted?" (reasonable pause), "Does any member wish to
18 change his or her vote?" (reasonable pause), "The Secretary will record the vote."
19 S50-200. Senate voting -- changing a vote -- objection. (1) A roll call vote must be taken on the

23 not explain a vote until after the decision is announced from the chair.
24 (3) A Senator may move to change the Senator's vote, on any recorded vote, within 1 legislative day of
25 the vote. The Senator making the motion shall first specify the bill number, the date of the vote, and the original
26 vote tally. A vote may not be changed if it would affect the outcome of legislation. The motion is nondebatable.
27 If none of the Senators physically or remotely present object, the change must be entered into the journal.
28 (4) If any Senator objects to the request in subsection (3), the Senator making the request may move to

3 S70-10. Nominations -- second term reappointments. (1) The Governor shall nominate and, by and
4 with the consent of the Senate, appoint all officers whose offices are established by the Montana Constitution or
5 which may be created by law and for whom appointment or election is not otherwise provided.
6 (2) If during a recess of the Senate a vacancy occurs in any office subject to Senate confirmation, the
7 Governor shall appoint some fit person to discharge the duties of the office until the next meeting of the Senate,
8 when the Governor shall nominate a person to fill the office.
9 (3) If the Governor is reelected to a second 4-year term of office, the Governor shall renominate all
10 retained officers that were previously confirmed pursuant to subsection (1). The Senate confirmation procedure
11 for a retained officer is the same as the confirmation procedure for a new appointment.

13 4-year term if the Governor had not been reelected to a second consecutive term.

6 individual nominee or group of nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees
7 being considered by the committee, the committee member may prepare an amendment for executive action to
8 strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a group of nominees is stricken, the committee
9 member that offered the amendment shall make a motion to request a committee resolution for the nominee or
10 nominees to be considered by a separate resolution. A simple majority of the committee is sufficient in order to
11 request a separate committee resolution.
12 (3) Within the Committee of the Whole, if a Senator wishes to have an individual nominee or group of
13 nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees recommended by the committee,
14 the Senator may prepare a floor amendment to strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a
15 group of nominees is stricken, a Senator may make a motion to request that the President of the Senate submit
16 a bill draft request for that the nominee or nominees to be considered by a separate resolution.
17 (4) When the resolution for an individual or group nomination has been prepared and introduced, the
18 committee shall take executive action on the resolution. When a hearing on the separated nomination was held
19 prior to the committee's standing committee report, an additional hearing is not required to be held before the
20 committee takes action on the separate resolution. After the committee's executive action, the committee chair
21 shall issue a standing committee report.
22 (5) The Secretary will read the reports under Order of Business No. 2, reports of standing committees.
23 (6) After the report has been read, the resolution must be placed on Order of Business No. 7 the next
24 legislative day for consideration by the Senate. Motions to approve or disapprove of the resolution are in order
25 and may be debated. Approval upon second reading constitutes confirmation of the Governor's nominee. A
26 motion to reconsider the approval or disapproval of a nomination made on second reading must occur within
27 one legislative day. A motion to reconsider may not be made if the resolution approving a confirmation is no
28 longer in the possession of the Senate.

7 (j) to amend;
8 (k) subject to subsection (1)(l), to postpone indefinitely; and
9 (l) to postpone indefinitely on a bill or resolution after its failure to receive a majority of those present
10 and voting on second reading.
11 (2) The motions listed in subsection (1) have precedence in the order listed.
12 (3) Subject to subsection (1)(l), a question may be indefinitely postponed by a majority roll call of all
13 Senators physically or remotely present and voting. When a bill or resolution is postponed indefinitely after
14 debate on second reading, it is finally rejected and may not be acted upon again except upon a motion of
15 reconsideration as provided in S50-90.
16 (4) A motion or proposition on a subject different from that under consideration may not be accepted
17 unless a substitute motion is in order.

Whole

1 (11) to pass business in Committee of the Whole;
2 (12) to take from the table;
3 (13) a decision of the presiding officer, unless appealed or unless the presiding officer submits the
4 question to the Senate for advice or decision; and
5 (14) all incidental motions, such as motions relating to voting or other questions of a general procedural
6 nature.
7 S50-70. Amending motions -- restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (2), no more than one
8 amendment and no more than one substitute motion may be made to a motion. This rule permits the main
9 motion and two modifying motions.
10 (2) A motion for a call of the Senate, for the previous question, to table, or to take from the table may
11 not be amended.
12 S50-80. Previous question. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the effect of calling for the
13 previous question, if adopted, is to close debate immediately, to prevent the offering of amendments or other
14 subsidiary motions, and to bring to vote promptly the immediately pending main question and the adhering
15 subsidiary motions, whether on appeal or otherwise. The motion for the previous question is nondebatable as
16 provided in S50-60(7).
17 (2) When the previous question is ordered on any debatable question on which there has been no
18 debate, the question may be debated for one-half hour, one-half of that time to be given to the proponents and
19 one-half to the opponents. The sponsor of the main motion on which the previous question is adopted may
20 close on the motion regardless of whether debate on the main motion has occurred.
21 (3) A call of the Senate is not in order after the previous question is ordered unless it appears upon an
22 actual count by the presiding officer that a quorum is not physically and remotely present.
23 S50-90. Reconsideration -- time restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (6), any Senator may, on the
24 day the vote was taken or on the next day the Senate is in session, move to reconsider the question. A motion
25 to reconsider is a debatable motion, but the debate is limited to the motion. The debate on a motion to
26 reconsider may not address the substance of the matter for which reconsideration is sought. However, an
27 inquiry may be made concerning the purpose of the motion to reconsider.
28 (2) A motion to reconsider must be disposed of when made unless a proper substitute motion is made

Amendment - 2nd Reading-yellow - Requested by: Tom McGillvray - (S) Committee of the
Whole
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.006
1 and adopted.
2 (3) A motion to recall a bill from the House of Representatives constitutes notice to reconsider and must
3 be acted on as a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider or to recall a bill from the House of
4 Representatives may be made only under Order of Business No. 9 and, under that order of business, takes
5 precedence over all motions except motions to recess or adjourn.
6 (4) When a motion to reconsider is laid on the table, a two-thirds majority is required to take it from the
7 table. When a motion to reconsider fails, the question is finally and conclusively settled.
8 (5) If a motion to reconsider third reading action is carried, there may not be further action until the
9 succeeding legislative day.
10 (6) If the Senate has adjourned for more than 2 days, then a motion to reconsider action taken on the
11 last day the Senate was in session is in order on the day the Senate reconvenes or on the following legislative
12 day.
13 S50-95. Rereferral. (1) Legislation that is in the possession of the Senate and that has been reported
14 from a committee with a do pass or be concurred in recommendation may be rereferred to a Senate committee
15 by a majority vote.
16 (2) (a) With the consent of the majority leader, the minority leader, and the bill sponsor, legislation that
17 has passed second reading, has been rereferred to the Finance and Claims Committee pursuant to subsection
18 (1), and is reported from committee without amendments may be placed on third reading.
19 (b) The third-reading agenda must specify that the legislation rereferred and reported from committee
20 under subsection (2)(a) was rereferred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee and reported from the
21 committee without amendments as passed on second reading.
22 (3) The individual making the rereferral motion shall announce the bill number, short bill title, and the
23 name of the sponsor of the bill immediately before it may be considered for rereferral.
24 S50-100. Dividing a question -- segregation excluded. A Senator may request to divide a question if
25 it includes two or more propositions so distinct in substance that if one thing is taken away a substantive
26 question will remain. A vote is not required on a request to divide a question, but the chair may rule that a
27 question is not divisible. The ruling of the chair may be appealed as provided in S20-10 and S20-20. For an
28 appeal of a ruling of the presiding officer, the question for the Senate must be stated as, "Shall the ruling of the
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5

Amendment - 2nd Reading-yellow - Requested by: Tom McGillvray - (S) Committee of the
Whole
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.006
1 chair be upheld?". A motion to segregate pursuant to S50-140(4) is not a request to divide a question.
2 S50-110. Rules for questions or bills requiring other than a majority vote. (1) Except as provided
3 in subsection (2), if a question or bill requires more than a majority vote for final passage, a majority vote is
4 sufficient to decide any question relating to the question or bill prior to third reading.
5 (2) Any vote in the Senate on a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana Constitution under
6 circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-thirds vote of
7 the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote. This rule does not
8 prevent a committee from indefinitely postponing or tabling a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana
9 Constitution.
10 (3) If a bill has been amended in the House of Representatives and the amendments are accepted by
11 the Senate, the bill must again be placed on third reading in the Senate to determine if the required number of
12 votes has been cast.
13 S50-120. Committee reports to Senate -- reconsideration. (1) Reports of standing committees must
14 be read on Order of Business No. 2, and, if there is no objection to form, are considered adopted. Subject to
15 subsection (4), debate may not be had on any report.
16 (2) On an adverse committee report, the sponsor may respond to the chair of the committee making the
17 report.
18 (3) Any Senator seeking a reconsideration of the Senate's action on the adoption of a committee report
19 shall do so on Order of Business No. 9 by motion to reconsider as provided in S50-90. Any Senator may make
20 the reconsideration motion and need not have voted on the prevailing side. This rule applies notwithstanding
21 any joint rule to the contrary. Subject to S50-90(6), the reconsideration motion must be made within 1 legislative
22 day of the adoption of the committee report and is not in order if the bill has been considered in Committee of
23 the Whole.
24 (4) (a) Subject to subsection (4)(b), the Rules Committee and conference committees may report at any
25 time, except during a call of the Senate, when a vote is being taken, or during Committee of the Whole.
26 (b) The Rules Committee may report during Committee of the Whole on matters referred to the
27 Committee by the Committee of the Whole.
28 S50-130. Conference committee -- reports. (1) When a conference committee report is filed with the

Whole
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.006
1 Secretary of the Senate, the report must be read under Order of Business No. 3, select committees, and placed
2 on the calendar the succeeding legislative day for consideration on second reading. If recommended favorably
3 by the Committee of the Whole, it may be considered on third reading the same legislative day.
4 (2) If both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopt the same conference committee report
5 on legislation requiring more than a majority vote for final passage, the Senate, following approval of the
6 conference committee report on third reading, shall place the final form of the legislation on third reading to
7 determine if the required vote is obtained.
8 (3) If the Senate rejects a conference committee report, the committee continues to exist unless
9 dissolved by the President or by motion. The committee may file a subsequent report.
10 (4) A Senate conference committee may confer regarding matters assigned to it with any House
11 conference committee with like jurisdiction and submit recommendations for consideration of the Senate.
12 S50-135. Adjournment sine die. (1) Subject to Article V, section 10(5), of the Montana Constitution, a
13 Senator may move that the Senate adjourn for the session.
14 (2) (a) The motion is debatable and may be made under any order of business except Order of
15 Business No. 7.
16 (b) Debate on the motion is limited to two proponents and two opponents.
17 S50-140. Second reading -- Committee of the Whole report -- segregation -- rejection. (1) The
18 Senate may resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole for consideration of business on second reading, by
19 approval of a motion for that purpose.
20 (2) After a Committee of the Whole has been formed, the President shall appoint a chair to preside.
21 (3) All legislation considered in the Committee of the Whole must be read by a summary of its title. The
22 sponsor shall make an opening statement, proposed amendments must be considered, and then the bill must
23 be considered in its entirety.
24 (4) Prior to adoption of the Committee of the Whole report, a Senator may move to segregate
25 legislation. If the motion prevails, the legislation remains on second reading.
26 (5) When a Committee of the Whole report on legislation is rejected, the legislation remains on second
27 reading.
28 S50-150. Committee of the Whole amendments. (1) All Committee of the Whole amendments must

19 (3) The motions listed in subsection (2) may be made in descending order as listed.
20 (4) Except for the President of the Senate or designee, a Senator may not be recognized between the
21 time a bill sponsor closes on the bill and the question is called by the presiding officer with a vote taken on the
22 bill or resolution.
23 S50-170. Committee of the Whole -- generally. (1) The Committee of the Whole may not appoint
24 subcommittees.
25 (2) The Committee of the Whole may not punish its members for misconduct, but may report disorder

28 No. 7, in addition to other methods, a recorded vote may be made in the following manner: the chair may call

Whole
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.006
1 for a voice vote to accept or reject a question. If the vote is other than unanimous, the chair may ask that the
2 lesser number on the question indicate their vote by an approved method of counting votes. The Secretary will
3 then record the vote. The chair may then rule that unless excused those of the greater number and physically
4 or remotely present have voted on the prevailing side of the question and that their vote be recorded as voting
5 on the prevailing side. If there was a unanimous voice vote, all those physically or remotely present will be
6 recorded as having voted for the question.
7 (2) A motion on second reading must be disposed of by a positive vote.
8 S50-190. Third reading procedure. (1) Unless rereferred to a committee by a majority vote after the
9 adoption of the Committee of the Whole report but before adjournment for the day, all legislation passing
10 second reading must be placed on third reading the day following the receipt of the engrossing or other

12 (2) On Order of Business No. 8 the Secretary shall read the title and the President shall state the
13 question as follows: "Senate bill number (or other appropriate identification)..... having been read three times,
14 the question is, shall the bill (or other appropriate identification) pass the Senate?"
15 (3) If an electronic voting system is used, the President shall state "Those in favor vote yes and those
16 opposed vote no" and the Secretary will sound the signal and open the board for voting. After a reasonable
17 pause the presiding officer asks "Has every member voted?" (reasonable pause), "Does any member wish to
18 change his or her vote?" (reasonable pause), "The Secretary will record the vote."

27 If none of the Senators physically or remotely present object, the change must be entered into the journal.

10 (4) The absentee vote authorization may be revoked before the vote by the member who signed the
11 authorization.
12 (5) Absentee voting is not allowed on third reading.
13 S50-220. Call of the Senate without a quorum. (1) In the absence of a quorum, a majority of

23 remotely present.
24 S50-230. House amendments to Senate legislation. (1) When the House has properly returned
25 Senate legislation with House amendments, the Senate shall announce the amendments on Order of Business

1 CHAPTER 7
2 Nominations from the Governor
3 S70-10. Nominations -- second term reappointments. (1) The Governor shall nominate and, by and
4 with the consent of the Senate, appoint all officers whose offices are established by the Montana Constitution or
5 which may be created by law and for whom appointment or election is not otherwise provided.
6 (2) If during a recess of the Senate a vacancy occurs in any office subject to Senate confirmation, the
7 Governor shall appoint some fit person to discharge the duties of the office until the next meeting of the Senate,
8 when the Governor shall nominate a person to fill the office.
9 (3) If the Governor is reelected to a second 4-year term of office, the Governor shall renominate all
10 retained officers that were previously confirmed pursuant to subsection (1). The Senate confirmation procedure
11 for a retained officer is the same as the confirmation procedure for a new appointment.
12 (4) A retained officer is an individual whose term would have expired at the end of the Governor’s first
13 4-year term if the Governor had not been reelected to a second consecutive term.
14 S70-20. Receiving nominations -- requesting bill drafts. (1) Nominations and renominations
15 received from the Governor must be:
16 (a) received by the President;
17 (b) delivered to the Secretary of the Senate; and
18 (c) read under Order of Business No. 4, messages from the Governor.
19 (2) The Secretary shall distribute a copy of the list of nominations and renominations to each Senator.
20 (3) (a) The President of the Senate shall submit a bill draft request for a resolution for each nominee or
21 each group of nominees read under Order of Business No. 4. These bill draft requests will not count against
22 any bill draft request limit imposed on the President of the Senate.
23 (b) Prior to introduction of the resolution, the President of the Senate shall designate the appropriate
24 committee chair or other member of the Senate to introduce the simple resolution.
25 S70-30. Committee process -- separate consideration. (1) (a) The committee shall research each
26 nominee and may request biographical information from the Governor for each nominee if none has been
27 provided.
28 (b) When the resolution has been prepared and introduced, the committee shall hold a hearing on the
- 28 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5

Amendment - 2nd Reading-yellow - Requested by: Tom McGillvray - (S) Committee of the
Whole
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0005.001.006
1 resolution after appropriate public notice has been given.
2 (2) (a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), following the hearings for a group of nominees, the
3 committee shall issue standing committee reports to be considered on second reading, stating the committee's
4 recommendations concerning the nominees.
5 (b) Following the hearings for the group of nominees, if a committee member wishes to have an
6 individual nominee or group of nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees
7 being considered by the committee, the committee member may prepare an amendment for executive action to
8 strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a group of nominees is stricken, the committee
9 member that offered the amendment shall make a motion to request a committee resolution for the nominee or
10 nominees to be considered by a separate resolution. A simple majority of the committee is sufficient in order to
11 request a separate committee resolution.
12 (3) Within the Committee of the Whole, if a Senator wishes to have an individual nominee or group of
13 nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees recommended by the committee,
14 the Senator may prepare a floor amendment to strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a
15 group of nominees is stricken, a Senator may make a motion to request that the President of the Senate submit
16 a bill draft request for that the nominee or nominees to be considered by a separate resolution.
17 (4) When the resolution for an individual or group nomination has been prepared and introduced, the
18 committee shall take executive action on the resolution. When a hearing on the separated nomination was held
19 prior to the committee's standing committee report, an additional hearing is not required to be held before the
20 committee takes action on the separate resolution. After the committee's executive action, the committee chair
21 shall issue a standing committee report.
22 (5) The Secretary will read the reports under Order of Business No. 2, reports of standing committees.
23 (6) After the report has been read, the resolution must be placed on Order of Business No. 7 the next
24 legislative day for consideration by the Senate. Motions to approve or disapprove of the resolution are in order
25 and may be debated. Approval upon second reading constitutes confirmation of the Governor's nominee. A
26 motion to reconsider the approval or disapproval of a nomination made on second reading must occur within
27 one legislative day. A motion to reconsider may not be made if the resolution approving a confirmation is no
28 longer in the possession of the Senate.
