21 CHAPTER 4
22 Legislation
23 S40-10. Types of legislation. The only types of legislation that may be introduced in the Senate are
24 those that have been drafted and approved by the Legislative Services Division and signed by a Senator as
25 chief sponsor. The types of legislation allowed include:
26 (1) bills of any subject, except appropriations;
27 (2) joint resolutions, which may be used for any purpose specified in Joint Rule 40-60; and

6 S40-20. Introduction -- first reading. (1) Upon receiving a bill or resolution from a Senator, the
7 Secretary of the Senate shall assign an appropriate sequential number, which constitutes introduction of the
8 legislation. Legislation properly introduced or received in the Senate must be announced across the rostrum
9 and public notice provided. This announcement constitutes first reading, and no debate or motion is in order
10 except that a Senator may question adherence to rules. Acknowledgment by the Secretary of the Senate of
11 receipt of legislation transmitted from the House commences the time limit for consideration of the legislation.
12 All legislation received by the Senate may be referred to a committee prior to being read across the rostrum.
13 (2) Bills and resolutions preintroduced as provided in Joint Rule 40-40 may be assigned to committee
14 by the President, posted online, and printed prior to the legislative session. The Legislative Services Division is
15 responsible for ensuring the preintroduction intent from each Senator and presenting the preintroduced
16 legislation to the Secretary of the Senate.
17 (3) Upon referral to committee by the President, the Secretary of the Senate shall publicly post a listing
18 of the bill or resolution by a summary of its title, together with a notation of the committee to which it has been
19 assigned.
20 (4) The sponsor may ask the Legislative Services Division to change or correct a short title used on the
21 bill status system.
22 S40-30. Cosponsors and additional sponsors. (1) Prior to submitting legislation to the Secretary of
23 the Senate for introduction, the chief sponsor may add representatives and senators as cosponsors. A
24 legislator shall sign the cosponsor form attached to the legislation in order to be added as a cosponsor.
25 (2) After legislation is submitted for introduction, sponsors may be added on motion of the chief sponsor
26 at any time prior to a standing committee report on the bill or resolution. Forms for adding sponsors will be
27 supplied on request by the Secretary of the Senate.
28 (3) Upon passage of the motion, the names of the additional sponsors will be printed in the journal and
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature - 2025 SR0005.2
1 the form containing the signatures of the additional sponsors will be forwarded to the Legislative Services
2 Division with the original bill for the inclusion of the names in subsequent printings of the bill or resolution.
3 S40-40. Reading limitations. (1) Every bill must be read three times prior to passage, either by title or
4 by summary of title as provided in these rules.
5 (2) A bill or resolution may not have more than one reading on the same day except the last legislative
6 day.
7 (3) An amendment may not be offered on third reading.
8 S40-60. Scheduling for second reading. (1) All bills and resolutions that have been reported by a
9 committee or withdrawn from a committee by motion, accepted by the Senate, and posted online and
10 reproduced must be scheduled by the President for consideration by Committee of the Whole.
11 (2) Until the 50th legislative day, 1 day must elapse between receiving the legislation from printing and
12 scheduling for second reading for consideration by Committee of the Whole unless a posted or printed version
13 of an unamended bill is available.
14 (3) The majority leader shall arrange legislation on the agenda in the order in which the bills will be
15 considered, unless otherwise ordered by the Senate or Committee of the Whole.
16 CHAPTER 5
17 Floor Action
18 S50-10. Attendance -- mandatory voting -- quorum. (1) Unless excused by the President, majority
19 leader, or minority leader, Senators EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBSECTION (2), A SENATOR must be physically OR
20 REMOTELY present every sitting of the Senate and shall vote on questions put before the Senate.
21 (2) A SENATOR SHALL NOTIFY THE PRESIDENT, MAJORITY LEADER, OR THE MINORITY LEADER IF THE SENATOR
22 WILL BE REMOTELY PRESENT OR ABSENT FOR A SITTING OF THE SENATE.
23 (2)(3) A majority of the Senate shall constitute a quorum to do business, but a smaller number may
24 adjourn from day to day and compel the attendance of absent Senators, in the manner and under penalties as
25 the Senate may prescribe (Montana Constitution, Art. V, sec. 10(2)).
26 S50-20. Orders of business. After prayer, roll call, and report on the journal, the order of business of
27 the Senate is as follows:
28 (1) communications and petitions;
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature - 2025 SR0005.2

9 (10) unfinished business;
10 (11) special orders of the day; and
11 (12) announcement of committee meetings.
12 To revert to or pass to a new order of business requires only a majority vote.
13 S50-30. Limitations on debate. A Senator may not speak more than twice on any one motion or
14 question without unanimous consent of the Senate, unless the Senator has introduced or proposed the motion
15 or question under debate, in which case the Senator may speak twice and also close the debate. However, a
16 Senator who has spoken may not speak again on the same motion or question to the exclusion of a Senator
17 who has not spoken.
18 S50-40. Procedure upon offering a motion. (1) When a motion is offered it must be restated by the
19 presiding officer. If requested by the presiding officer or a Senator, it must be reduced to writing, presented at
20 the rostrum, and read aloud by the Secretary.
21 (2) A motion may be withdrawn by the Senator offering it at any time before it is amended or voted
22 upon.
23 (3) A motion is carried by a majority of the Senate present and voting unless otherwise stated in the
24 Senate Rules.
25 S50-50. Precedence of motions. (1) When a question is under debate only the following privileged
26 and subsidiary motions may be made:
27 (a) to adjourn for the day (nondebatable S50-60);
28 (b) to adjourn sine die (debatable S50-135);
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature - 2025 SR0005.2
1 (c) for a call of the Senate (nondebatable S50-60);
2 (d) to recess (nondebatable S50-60);
3 (e) question of privilege;
4 (f) to lay on the table (nondebatable S50-60);
5 (g) for the previous question (nondebatable S50-60);
6 (h) to postpone to a certain day;
7 (i) to refer or commit;
8 (j) to amend;
9 (k) subject to subsection (1)(l), to postpone indefinitely; and
10 (l) to postpone indefinitely on a bill or resolution after its failure to receive a majority of those present
11 and voting on second reading.
12 (2) The motions listed in subsection (1) have precedence in the order listed.
13 (3) Subject to subsection (1)(l), a question may be indefinitely postponed by a majority roll call of all
14 Senators physically or remotely present and voting. When a bill or resolution is postponed indefinitely after
15 debate on second reading, it is finally rejected and may not be acted upon again except upon a motion of
16 reconsideration as provided in S50-90.
17 (4) A motion or proposition on a subject different from that under consideration may not be accepted
18 unless a substitute motion is in order.
19 S50-60. Nondebatable motions. The following motions are not debatable:
20 (1) to adjourn for the day;
21 (2) for a call of the Senate;
22 (3) to recess or rise;
23 (4) for parliamentary inquiry;
24 (5) for suspension of the rules;
25 (6) to lay on the table;
26 (7) for the previous question;
27 (8) to limit, extend the limits of, or to close debate;
28 (9) to amend an undebatable motion;
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature - 2025 SR0005.2
1 (10) to change a vote (S50-200);
2 (11) to pass business in Committee of the Whole;
3 (12) to take from the table;
4 (13) a decision of the presiding officer, unless appealed or unless the presiding officer submits the
5 question to the Senate for advice or decision; and
6 (14) all incidental motions, such as motions relating to voting or other questions of a general procedural
7 nature.
8 S50-70. Amending motions -- restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (2), no more than one
9 amendment and no more than one substitute motion may be made to a motion. This rule permits the main
10 motion and two modifying motions.
11 (2) A motion for a call of the Senate, for the previous question, to table, or to take from the table may
12 not be amended.
13 S50-80. Previous question. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the effect of calling for the
14 previous question, if adopted, is to close debate immediately, to prevent the offering of amendments or other
15 subsidiary motions, and to bring to vote promptly the immediately pending main question and the adhering
16 subsidiary motions, whether on appeal or otherwise. The motion for the previous question is nondebatable as
17 provided in S50-60(7).
18 (2) When the previous question is ordered on any debatable question on which there has been no
19 debate, the question may be debated for one-half hour, one-half of that time to be given to the proponents and
20 one-half to the opponents. The sponsor of the main motion on which the previous question is adopted may
21 close on the motion regardless of whether debate on the main motion has occurred.
22 (3) A call of the Senate is not in order after the previous question is ordered unless it appears upon an
23 actual count by the presiding officer that a quorum is not physically and remotely present.
24 S50-90. Reconsideration -- time restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (6), any Senator may, on the
25 day the vote was taken or on the next day the Senate is in session, move to reconsider the question. A motion
26 to reconsider is a debatable motion, but the debate is limited to the motion. The debate on a motion to
27 reconsider may not address the substance of the matter for which reconsideration is sought. However, an
28 inquiry may be made concerning the purpose of the motion to reconsider.
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature - 2025 SR0005.2
1 (2) A motion to reconsider must be disposed of when made unless a proper substitute motion is made
2 and adopted.
3 (3) A motion to recall a bill from the House of Representatives constitutes notice to reconsider and must
4 be acted on as a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider or to recall a bill from the House of
5 Representatives may be made only under Order of Business No. 9 and, under that order of business, takes
6 precedence over all motions except motions to recess or adjourn.
7 (4) When a motion to reconsider is laid on the table, a two-thirds majority is required to take it from the
8 table. When a motion to reconsider fails, the question is finally and conclusively settled.
9 (5) If a motion to reconsider third reading action is carried, there may not be further action until the
10 succeeding legislative day.
11 (6) If the Senate has adjourned for more than 2 days, then a motion to reconsider action taken on the
12 last day the Senate was in session is in order on the day the Senate reconvenes or on the following legislative
13 day.
14 S50-95. Rereferral. (1) Legislation that is in the possession of the Senate and that has been reported
15 from a committee with a do pass or be concurred in recommendation may be rereferred to a Senate committee
16 by a majority vote.
17 (2) (a) With the consent of the majority leader, the minority leader, and the bill sponsor, legislation that
18 has passed second reading, has been rereferred to the Finance and Claims Committee pursuant to subsection
19 (1), and is reported from committee without amendments may be placed on third reading.
20 (b) The third-reading agenda must specify that the legislation rereferred and reported from committee
21 under subsection (2)(a) was rereferred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee and reported from the
22 committee without amendments as passed on second reading.
23 (3) The individual making the rereferral motion shall announce the bill number, short bill title, and the
24 name of the sponsor of the bill immediately before it may be considered for rereferral.
25 S50-100. Dividing a question -- segregation excluded. A Senator may request to divide a question if
26 it includes two or more propositions so distinct in substance that if one thing is taken away a substantive
27 question will remain. A vote is not required on a request to divide a question, but the chair may rule that a
28 question is not divisible. The ruling of the chair may be appealed as provided in S20-10 and S20-20. For an
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature - 2025 SR0005.2
1 appeal of a ruling of the presiding officer, the question for the Senate must be stated as, "Shall the ruling of the
2 chair be upheld?". A motion to segregate pursuant to S50-140(4) is not a request to divide a question.
3 S50-110. Rules for questions or bills requiring other than a majority vote. (1) Except as provided
4 in subsection (2), if a question or bill requires more than a majority vote for final passage, a majority vote is
5 sufficient to decide any question relating to the question or bill prior to third reading.
6 (2) Any vote in the Senate on a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana Constitution under
7 circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-thirds vote of
8 the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote. This rule does not
9 prevent a committee from indefinitely postponing or tabling a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana
10 Constitution.
11 (3) If a bill has been amended in the House of Representatives and the amendments are accepted by
12 the Senate, the bill must again be placed on third reading in the Senate to determine if the required number of
13 votes has been cast.
14 S50-120. Committee reports to Senate -- reconsideration. (1) Reports of standing committees must
15 be read on Order of Business No. 2, and, if there is no objection to form, are considered adopted. Subject to
16 subsection (4), debate may not be had on any report.
17 (2) On an adverse committee report, the sponsor may respond to the chair of the committee making the
18 report.
19 (3) Any Senator seeking a reconsideration of the Senate's action on the adoption of a committee report
20 shall do so on Order of Business No. 9 by motion to reconsider as provided in S50-90. Any Senator may make
21 the reconsideration motion and need not have voted on the prevailing side. This rule applies notwithstanding
22 any joint rule to the contrary. Subject to S50-90(6), the reconsideration motion must be made within 1 legislative
23 day of the adoption of the committee report and is not in order if the bill has been considered in Committee of
24 the Whole.
25 (4) (a) Subject to subsection (4)(b), the Rules Committee and conference committees may report at any
26 time, except during a call of the Senate, when a vote is being taken, or during Committee of the Whole.
27 (b) The Rules Committee may report during Committee of the Whole on matters referred to the
28 Committee by the Committee of the Whole.
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature - 2025 SR0005.2
1 S50-130. Conference committee -- reports. (1) When a conference committee report is filed with the
2 Secretary of the Senate, the report must be read under Order of Business No. 3, select committees, and placed
3 on the calendar the succeeding legislative day for consideration on second reading. If recommended favorably
4 by the Committee of the Whole, it may be considered on third reading the same legislative day.
5 (2) If both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopt the same conference committee report
6 on legislation requiring more than a majority vote for final passage, the Senate, following approval of the
7 conference committee report on third reading, shall place the final form of the legislation on third reading to
8 determine if the required vote is obtained.
9 (3) If the Senate rejects a conference committee report, the committee continues to exist unless
10 dissolved by the President or by motion. The committee may file a subsequent report.
11 (4) A Senate conference committee may confer regarding matters assigned to it with any House
12 conference committee with like jurisdiction and submit recommendations for consideration of the Senate.
13 S50-135. Adjournment sine die. (1) Subject to Article V, section 10(5), of the Montana Constitution, a
14 Senator may move that the Senate adjourn for the session.
15 (2) (a) The motion is debatable and may be made under any order of business except Order of
16 Business No. 7.
17 (b) Debate on the motion is limited to two proponents and two opponents.
18 S50-140. Second reading -- Committee of the Whole report -- segregation -- rejection. (1) The
19 Senate may resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole for consideration of business on second reading, by
20 approval of a motion for that purpose.
21 (2) After a Committee of the Whole has been formed, the President shall appoint a chair to preside.
22 (3) All legislation considered in the Committee of the Whole must be read by a summary of its title. The
23 sponsor shall make an opening statement, proposed amendments must be considered, and then the bill must
24 be considered in its entirety.
25 (4) Prior to adoption of the Committee of the Whole report, a Senator may move to segregate
26 legislation. If the motion prevails, the legislation remains on second reading.
27 (5) When a Committee of the Whole report on legislation is rejected, the legislation remains on second
28 reading.
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature - 2025 SR0005.2
1 S50-150. Committee of the Whole amendments. (1) All Committee of the Whole amendments must
2 be prepared by the staff of the Legislative Services Division, stipulating the date and time of preparation and
3 staff approval, and delivered to the Secretary of the Senate for reading before the amendment is voted on.
4 (2) Each amendment, rejected or adopted, must be referenced in the journal, along with the name of
5 the sponsor and the vote on each.
6 S50-160. Motions in Committee of the Whole. (1) All proper motions on second reading are
7 debatable unless specified in S50-60.
8 (2) The only motions in order during Committee of the Whole are to:

10 (b) recommend concurrence or nonconcurrence (House amendments to Senate legislation);
11 (c) amend;

20 (3) The motions listed in subsection (2) may be made in descending order as listed.
21 (4) Except for the President of the Senate or designee, a Senator may not be recognized between the
22 time a bill sponsor closes on the bill and the question is called by the presiding officer with a vote taken on the
23 bill or resolution.
24 S50-170. Committee of the Whole -- generally. (1) The Committee of the Whole may not appoint
25 subcommittees.
26 (2) The Committee of the Whole may not punish its members for misconduct, but may report disorder
27 to the Senate.
28 S50-180. Voting on second reading -- positive disposition of motions. (1) On Order of Business
- 24 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature - 2025 SR0005.2
1 No. 7, in addition to other methods, a recorded vote may be made in the following manner: the chair may call
2 for a voice vote to accept or reject a question. If the vote is other than unanimous, the chair may ask that the
3 lesser number on the question indicate their vote by an approved method of counting votes. The Secretary will
4 then record the vote. The chair may then rule that unless excused those of the greater number and physically
5 or remotely present have voted on the prevailing side of the question and that their vote be recorded as voting
6 on the prevailing side. If there was a unanimous voice vote, all those physically or remotely present will be
7 recorded as having voted for the question.
8 (2) A motion on second reading must be disposed of by a positive vote.
9 S50-190. Third reading procedure. (1) Unless rereferred to a committee by a majority vote after the
10 adoption of the Committee of the Whole report but before adjournment for the day, all legislation passing
11 second reading must be placed on third reading the day following the receipt of the engrossing or other

21 request of two Senators, if the request occurs before the vote is taken.
22 (2) On a roll call vote the names of the Senators must be called alphabetically, unless an electronic
23 voting system is used. A Senator may not vote after the decision is announced from the chair. A Senator may
24 not explain a vote until after the decision is announced from the chair.
25 (3) A Senator may move to change the Senator's vote, on any recorded vote, within 1 legislative day of

4 minutes of the malfunction.

11 (4) The absentee vote authorization may be revoked before the vote by the member who signed the
12 authorization.
13 (5) Absentee voting is not allowed on third reading.
14 S50-220. Call of the Senate without a quorum. (1) In the absence of a quorum, a majority of
15 Senators physically and remotely present may compel the attendance of absent Senators by ordering a call of
16 the Senate. A call of the Senate is not in order if a majority of Senators are physically and remotely present.
17 (2) On a call of the Senate, a Senator who refuses to attend may be arrested by the Sergeant-at-Arms
18 or any other person, as the majority of the Senators present direct. When the attendance of an absent Senator
19 is secured and the Senate refuses to excuse the Senator's absence, the Senator may not be paid any expense
20 payments while absent and is liable for the expenses incurred in procuring the Senator's attendance.
21 (3) During a call of the Senate, all business must be suspended. After a call has been ordered, no
22 motion is in order except a motion to adjourn or remove the call. When a quorum has been achieved under the

26 Senate legislation with House amendments, the Senate shall announce the amendments on Order of Business
27 No. 5 and the President shall place them on second reading for debate. The President may rerefer Senate

1 significant change in the Senate legislation. The second reading vote is limited to consideration of the House
2 amendments.

- 27 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature - 2025 SR0005.2
1 Senate, supersedes a joint rule.
2 CHAPTER 7
3 Nominations from the Governor
4 S70-10. Nominations -- second term reappointments. (1) The Governor shall nominate and, by and
5 with the consent of the Senate, appoint all officers whose offices are established by the Montana Constitution or
6 which may be created by law and for whom appointment or election is not otherwise provided.
7 (2) If during a recess of the Senate a vacancy occurs in any office subject to Senate confirmation, the
8 Governor shall appoint some fit person to discharge the duties of the office until the next meeting of the Senate,
9 when the Governor shall nominate a person to fill the office.
10 (3) If the Governor is reelected to a second 4-year term of office, the Governor shall renominate all
11 retained officers that were previously confirmed pursuant to subsection (1). The Senate confirmation procedure
12 for a retained officer is the same as the confirmation procedure for a new appointment.
13 (4) A retained officer is an individual whose term would have expired at the end of the Governor’s first
14 4-year term if the Governor had not been reelected to a second consecutive term.
15 S70-20. Receiving nominations -- requesting bill drafts. (1) Nominations and renominations
16 received from the Governor must be:
17 (a) received by the President;

19 (c) read under Order of Business No. 4, messages from the Governor.
20 (2) The Secretary shall distribute a copy of the list of nominations and renominations to each Senator.
21 (3) (a) The President of the Senate shall submit a bill draft request for a resolution for each nominee or
22 each group of nominees read under Order of Business No. 4. These bill draft requests will not count against
23 any bill draft request limit imposed on the President of the Senate.
24 (b) Prior to introduction of the resolution, the President of the Senate shall designate the appropriate
25 committee chair or other member of the Senate to introduce the simple resolution.
26 S70-30. Committee process -- separate consideration. (1) (a) The committee shall research each

- 28 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
69th Legislature - 2025 SR0005.2
1 (b) When the resolution has been prepared and introduced, the committee shall hold a hearing on the
2 resolution after appropriate public notice has been given.
3 (2) (a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), following the hearings for a group of nominees, the
4 committee shall issue standing committee reports to be considered on second reading, stating the committee's
5 recommendations concerning the nominees.
6 (b) Following the hearings for the group of nominees, if a committee member wishes to have an
7 individual nominee or group of nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees
8 being considered by the committee, the committee member may prepare an amendment for executive action to
9 strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a group of nominees is stricken, the committee
10 member that offered the amendment shall make a motion to request a committee resolution for the nominee or
11 nominees to be considered by a separate resolution. A simple majority of the committee is sufficient in order to
12 request a separate committee resolution.
13 (3) Within the Committee of the Whole, if a Senator wishes to have an individual nominee or group of
14 nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees recommended by the committee,
15 the Senator may prepare a floor amendment to strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a
16 group of nominees is stricken, a Senator may make a motion to request that the President of the Senate submit
17 a bill draft request for that the nominee or nominees to be considered by a separate resolution.
18 (4) When the resolution for an individual or group nomination has been prepared and introduced, the
19 committee shall take executive action on the resolution. When a hearing on the separated nomination was held
20 prior to the committee's standing committee report, an additional hearing is not required to be held before the
21 committee takes action on the separate resolution. After the committee's executive action, the committee chair
22 shall issue a standing committee report.
23 (5) The Secretary will read the reports under Order of Business No. 2, reports of standing committees.
24 (6) After the report has been read, the resolution must be placed on Order of Business No. 7 the next
25 legislative day for consideration by the Senate. Motions to approve or disapprove of the resolution are in order
26 and may be debated. Approval upon second reading constitutes confirmation of the Governor's nominee. A
27 motion to reconsider the approval or disapproval of a nomination made on second reading must occur within
28 one legislative day. A motion to reconsider may not be made if the resolution approving a confirmation is no
- 29 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5

17 who has not spoken.
18 S50-40. Procedure upon offering a motion. (1) When a motion is offered it must be restated by the

13 (3) Subject to subsection (1)(l), a question may be indefinitely postponed by a majority roll call of all
14 Senators physically or remotely present and voting. When a bill or resolution is postponed indefinitely after
15 debate on second reading, it is finally rejected and may not be acted upon again except upon a motion of
16 reconsideration as provided in S50-90.
17 (4) A motion or proposition on a subject different from that under consideration may not be accepted
18 unless a substitute motion is in order.

12 not be amended.
13 S50-80. Previous question. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the effect of calling for the
14 previous question, if adopted, is to close debate immediately, to prevent the offering of amendments or other
15 subsidiary motions, and to bring to vote promptly the immediately pending main question and the adhering
16 subsidiary motions, whether on appeal or otherwise. The motion for the previous question is nondebatable as
17 provided in S50-60(7).
18 (2) When the previous question is ordered on any debatable question on which there has been no
19 debate, the question may be debated for one-half hour, one-half of that time to be given to the proponents and

21 close on the motion regardless of whether debate on the main motion has occurred.

24 S50-90. Reconsideration -- time restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (6), any Senator may, on the
25 day the vote was taken or on the next day the Senate is in session, move to reconsider the question. A motion
26 to reconsider is a debatable motion, but the debate is limited to the motion. The debate on a motion to
27 reconsider may not address the substance of the matter for which reconsideration is sought. However, an
28 inquiry may be made concerning the purpose of the motion to reconsider.
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5

69th Legislature - 2025 SR0005.2
1 (2) A motion to reconsider must be disposed of when made unless a proper substitute motion is made
2 and adopted.
3 (3) A motion to recall a bill from the House of Representatives constitutes notice to reconsider and must
4 be acted on as a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider or to recall a bill from the House of
5 Representatives may be made only under Order of Business No. 9 and, under that order of business, takes
6 precedence over all motions except motions to recess or adjourn.
7 (4) When a motion to reconsider is laid on the table, a two-thirds majority is required to take it from the
8 table. When a motion to reconsider fails, the question is finally and conclusively settled.
9 (5) If a motion to reconsider third reading action is carried, there may not be further action until the
10 succeeding legislative day.
11 (6) If the Senate has adjourned for more than 2 days, then a motion to reconsider action taken on the
12 last day the Senate was in session is in order on the day the Senate reconvenes or on the following legislative
13 day.
14 S50-95. Rereferral. (1) Legislation that is in the possession of the Senate and that has been reported
15 from a committee with a do pass or be concurred in recommendation may be rereferred to a Senate committee

20 (b) The third-reading agenda must specify that the legislation rereferred and reported from committee
21 under subsection (2)(a) was rereferred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee and reported from the
22 committee without amendments as passed on second reading.
23 (3) The individual making the rereferral motion shall announce the bill number, short bill title, and the
24 name of the sponsor of the bill immediately before it may be considered for rereferral.
25 S50-100. Dividing a question -- segregation excluded. A Senator may request to divide a question if
26 it includes two or more propositions so distinct in substance that if one thing is taken away a substantive
27 question will remain. A vote is not required on a request to divide a question, but the chair may rule that a
28 question is not divisible. The ruling of the chair may be appealed as provided in S20-10 and S20-20. For an

20 shall do so on Order of Business No. 9 by motion to reconsider as provided in S50-90. Any Senator may make
21 the reconsideration motion and need not have voted on the prevailing side. This rule applies notwithstanding
22 any joint rule to the contrary. Subject to S50-90(6), the reconsideration motion must be made within 1 legislative
23 day of the adoption of the committee report and is not in order if the bill has been considered in Committee of
24 the Whole.

26 time, except during a call of the Senate, when a vote is being taken, or during Committee of the Whole.

19 Senate may resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole for consideration of business on second reading, by
20 approval of a motion for that purpose.
21 (2) After a Committee of the Whole has been formed, the President shall appoint a chair to preside.
22 (3) All legislation considered in the Committee of the Whole must be read by a summary of its title. The
