who has not spoken.
S50-40. Procedure upon offering a motion. (1) When a motion is offered it must be restated by the

question to the Senate for advice or decision; and
(14) all incidental motions, such as motions relating to voting or other questions of a general procedural
nature.
S50-70. Amending motions -- restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (2), no more than one
amendment and no more than one substitute motion may be made to a motion. This rule permits the main
motion and two modifying motions.
(2) A motion for a call of the Senate, for the previous question, to table, or to take from the table may
not be amended.
S50-80. Previous question. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the effect of calling for the
previous question, if adopted, is to close debate immediately, to prevent the offering of amendments or other
subsidiary motions, and to bring to vote promptly the immediately pending main question and the adhering
subsidiary motions, whether on appeal or otherwise. The motion for the previous question is nondebatable as
provided in S50-60(7).
(2) When the previous question is ordered on any debatable question on which there has been no
debate, the question may be debated for one-half hour, one-half of that time to be given to the proponents and
one-half to the opponents. The sponsor of the main motion on which the previous question is adopted may
close on the motion regardless of whether debate on the main motion has occurred.
(3) A call of the Senate is not in order after the previous question is ordered unless it appears upon an
actual count by the presiding officer that a quorum is not physically and remotely present.
S50-90. Reconsideration -- time restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (6), any Senator may, on the
day the vote was taken or on the next day the Senate is in session, move to reconsider the question. A motion
to reconsider is a debatable motion, but the debate is limited to the motion. The debate on a motion to
reconsider may not address the substance of the matter for which reconsideration is sought. However, an
inquiry may be made concerning the purpose of the motion to reconsider.
(2) A motion to reconsider must be disposed of when made unless a proper substitute motion is made
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature - 2025 SR 5
and adopted.
(3) A motion to recall a bill from the House of Representatives constitutes notice to reconsider and must
be acted on as a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider or to recall a bill from the House of
Representatives may be made only under Order of Business No. 9 and, under that order of business, takes
precedence over all motions except motions to recess or adjourn.
(4) When a motion to reconsider is laid on the table, a two-thirds majority is required to take it from the
table. When a motion to reconsider fails, the question is finally and conclusively settled.
(5) If a motion to reconsider third reading action is carried, there may not be further action until the
succeeding legislative day.
(6) If the Senate has adjourned for more than 2 days, then a motion to reconsider action taken on the
last day the Senate was in session is in order on the day the Senate reconvenes or on the following legislative
day.
S50-95. Rereferral. (1) Legislation that is in the possession of the Senate and that has been reported
from a committee with a do pass or be concurred in recommendation may be rereferred to a Senate committee
by a majority vote.
(2) (a) With the consent of the majority leader, the minority leader, and the bill sponsor, legislation that
has passed second reading, has been rereferred to the Finance and Claims Committee pursuant to subsection
(1), and is reported from committee without amendments may be placed on third reading.
(b) The third-reading agenda must specify that the legislation rereferred and reported from committee
under subsection (2)(a) was rereferred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee and reported from the
committee without amendments as passed on second reading.
(3) The individual making the rereferral motion shall announce the bill number, short bill title, and the
name of the sponsor of the bill immediately before it may be considered for rereferral.
S50-100. Dividing a question -- segregation excluded. A Senator may request to divide a question if
it includes two or more propositions so distinct in substance that if one thing is taken away a substantive
question will remain. A vote is not required on a request to divide a question, but the chair may rule that a
question is not divisible. The ruling of the chair may be appealed as provided in S20-10 and S20-20. For an
appeal of a ruling of the presiding officer, the question for the Senate must be stated as, "Shall the ruling of the
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature - 2025 SR 5
chair be upheld?". A motion to segregate pursuant to S50-140(4) is not a request to divide a question.
S50-110. Rules for questions or bills requiring other than a majority vote. (1) Except as provided
in subsection (2), if a question or bill requires more than a majority vote for final passage, a majority vote is
sufficient to decide any question relating to the question or bill prior to third reading.
(2) Any vote in the Senate on a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana Constitution under
circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-thirds vote of
the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote. This rule does not
prevent a committee from indefinitely postponing or tabling a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana
Constitution.
(3) If a bill has been amended in the House of Representatives and the amendments are accepted by
the Senate, the bill must again be placed on third reading in the Senate to determine if the required number of
votes has been cast.
S50-120. Committee reports to Senate -- reconsideration. (1) Reports of standing committees must
be read on Order of Business No. 2, and, if there is no objection to form, are considered adopted. Subject to
subsection (4), debate may not be had on any report.
(2) On an adverse committee report, the sponsor may respond to the chair of the committee making the
report.
(3) Any Senator seeking a reconsideration of the Senate's action on the adoption of a committee report
shall do so on Order of Business No. 9 by motion to reconsider as provided in S50-90. Any Senator may make
the reconsideration motion and need not have voted on the prevailing side. This rule applies notwithstanding
any joint rule to the contrary. Subject to S50-90(6), the reconsideration motion must be made within 1 legislative
day of the adoption of the committee report and is not in order if the bill has been considered in Committee of
the Whole.
(4) (a) Subject to subsection (4)(b), the Rules Committee and conference committees may report at any
time, except during a call of the Senate, when a vote is being taken, or during Committee of the Whole.
(b) The Rules Committee may report during Committee of the Whole on matters referred to the
Committee by the Committee of the Whole.
S50-130. Conference committee -- reports. (1) When a conference committee report is filed with the
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature - 2025 SR 5
Secretary of the Senate, the report must be read under Order of Business No. 3, select committees, and placed
on the calendar the succeeding legislative day for consideration on second reading. If recommended favorably
by the Committee of the Whole, it may be considered on third reading the same legislative day.
(2) If both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopt the same conference committee report
on legislation requiring more than a majority vote for final passage, the Senate, following approval of the
conference committee report on third reading, shall place the final form of the legislation on third reading to
determine if the required vote is obtained.
(3) If the Senate rejects a conference committee report, the committee continues to exist unless
dissolved by the President or by motion. The committee may file a subsequent report.
(4) A Senate conference committee may confer regarding matters assigned to it with any House
conference committee with like jurisdiction and submit recommendations for consideration of the Senate.
S50-135. Adjournment sine die. (1) Subject to Article V, section 10(5), of the Montana Constitution, a
Senator may move that the Senate adjourn for the session.
(2) (a) The motion is debatable and may be made under any order of business except Order of
Business No. 7.
(b) Debate on the motion is limited to two proponents and two opponents.
S50-140. Second reading -- Committee of the Whole report -- segregation -- rejection. (1) The
Senate may resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole for consideration of business on second reading, by
approval of a motion for that purpose.
(2) After a Committee of the Whole has been formed, the President shall appoint a chair to preside.
(3) All legislation considered in the Committee of the Whole must be read by a summary of its title. The
sponsor shall make an opening statement, proposed amendments must be considered, and then the bill must
be considered in its entirety.
(4) Prior to adoption of the Committee of the Whole report, a Senator may move to segregate
legislation. If the motion prevails, the legislation remains on second reading.
(5) When a Committee of the Whole report on legislation is rejected, the legislation remains on second
reading.
S50-150. Committee of the Whole amendments. (1) All Committee of the Whole amendments must
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature - 2025 SR 5
be prepared by the staff of the Legislative Services Division, stipulating the date and time of preparation and
staff approval, and delivered to the Secretary of the Senate for reading before the amendment is voted on.

for a voice vote to accept or reject a question. If the vote is other than unanimous, the chair may ask that the
lesser number on the question indicate their vote by an approved method of counting votes. The Secretary will
then record the vote. The chair may then rule that unless excused those of the greater number and physically

(2) A motion on second reading must be disposed of by a positive vote.
S50-190. Third reading procedure. (1) Unless rereferred to a committee by a majority vote after the
adoption of the Committee of the Whole report but before adjournment for the day, all legislation passing
second reading must be placed on third reading the day following the receipt of the engrossing or other
appropriate printing report.
(2) On Order of Business No. 8 the Secretary shall read the title and the President shall state the
question as follows: "Senate bill number (or other appropriate identification)..... having been read three times,

opposed vote no" and the Secretary will sound the signal and open the board for voting. After a reasonable
pause the presiding officer asks "Has every member voted?" (reasonable pause), "Does any member wish to
change his or her vote?" (reasonable pause), "The Secretary will record the vote."

payments while absent and is liable for the expenses incurred in procuring the Senator's attendance.

amendments.

CHAPTER 7
Nominations from the Governor
S70-10. Nominations -- second term reappointments. (1) The Governor shall nominate and, by and

(2) If during a recess of the Senate a vacancy occurs in any office subject to Senate confirmation, the
Governor shall appoint some fit person to discharge the duties of the office until the next meeting of the Senate,
when the Governor shall nominate a person to fill the office.
(3) If the Governor is reelected to a second 4-year term of office, the Governor shall renominate all
retained officers that were previously confirmed pursuant to subsection (1). The Senate confirmation procedure
for a retained officer is the same as the confirmation procedure for a new appointment.

4-year term if the Governor had not been reelected to a second consecutive term.
S70-20. Receiving nominations -- requesting bill drafts. (1) Nominations and renominations
received from the Governor must be:

(2) The Secretary shall distribute a copy of the list of nominations and renominations to each Senator.
(3) (a) The President of the Senate shall submit a bill draft request for a resolution for each nominee or

committee chair or other member of the Senate to introduce the simple resolution.

ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature - 2025 SR 5

individual nominee or group of nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees
being considered by the committee, the committee member may prepare an amendment for executive action to
strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a group of nominees is stricken, the committee
member that offered the amendment shall make a motion to request a committee resolution for the nominee or
nominees to be considered by a separate resolution. A simple majority of the committee is sufficient in order to
request a separate committee resolution.
(3) Within the Committee of the Whole, if a Senator wishes to have an individual nominee or group of
nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees recommended by the committee,
the Senator may prepare a floor amendment to strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a

a bill draft request for that the nominee or nominees to be considered by a separate resolution.
(4) When the resolution for an individual or group nomination has been prepared and introduced, the
committee shall take executive action on the resolution. When a hearing on the separated nomination was held

committee takes action on the separate resolution. After the committee's executive action, the committee chair
shall issue a standing committee report.
(5) The Secretary will read the reports under Order of Business No. 2, reports of standing committees.
(6) After the report has been read, the resolution must be placed on Order of Business No. 7 the next
legislative day for consideration by the Senate. Motions to approve or disapprove of the resolution are in order
and may be debated. Approval upon second reading constitutes confirmation of the Governor's nominee. A
motion to reconsider the approval or disapproval of a nomination made on second reading must occur within
one legislative day. A motion to reconsider may not be made if the resolution approving a confirmation is no
longer in the possession of the Senate.
- 29 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5

nature.
S50-70. Amending motions -- restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (2), no more than one
amendment and no more than one substitute motion may be made to a motion. This rule permits the main
motion and two modifying motions.
(2) A motion for a call of the Senate, for the previous question, to table, or to take from the table may
not be amended.
S50-80. Previous question. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the effect of calling for the
previous question, if adopted, is to close debate immediately, to prevent the offering of amendments or other
subsidiary motions, and to bring to vote promptly the immediately pending main question and the adhering
subsidiary motions, whether on appeal or otherwise. The motion for the previous question is nondebatable as
provided in S50-60(7).
(2) When the previous question is ordered on any debatable question on which there has been no
debate, the question may be debated for one-half hour, one-half of that time to be given to the proponents and
one-half to the opponents. The sponsor of the main motion on which the previous question is adopted may
close on the motion regardless of whether debate on the main motion has occurred.
(3) A call of the Senate is not in order after the previous question is ordered unless it appears upon an
actual count by the presiding officer that a quorum is not physically and remotely present.
S50-90. Reconsideration -- time restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (6), any Senator may, on the
day the vote was taken or on the next day the Senate is in session, move to reconsider the question. A motion
to reconsider is a debatable motion, but the debate is limited to the motion. The debate on a motion to
reconsider may not address the substance of the matter for which reconsideration is sought. However, an
inquiry may be made concerning the purpose of the motion to reconsider.
(2) A motion to reconsider must be disposed of when made unless a proper substitute motion is made
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
ENROLLED BILL

69th Legislature - 2025 SR 5
and adopted.
(3) A motion to recall a bill from the House of Representatives constitutes notice to reconsider and must
be acted on as a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider or to recall a bill from the House of
Representatives may be made only under Order of Business No. 9 and, under that order of business, takes
precedence over all motions except motions to recess or adjourn.
(4) When a motion to reconsider is laid on the table, a two-thirds majority is required to take it from the
table. When a motion to reconsider fails, the question is finally and conclusively settled.
(5) If a motion to reconsider third reading action is carried, there may not be further action until the
succeeding legislative day.
(6) If the Senate has adjourned for more than 2 days, then a motion to reconsider action taken on the
last day the Senate was in session is in order on the day the Senate reconvenes or on the following legislative
day.
S50-95. Rereferral. (1) Legislation that is in the possession of the Senate and that has been reported
from a committee with a do pass or be concurred in recommendation may be rereferred to a Senate committee
by a majority vote.
(2) (a) With the consent of the majority leader, the minority leader, and the bill sponsor, legislation that
has passed second reading, has been rereferred to the Finance and Claims Committee pursuant to subsection
(1), and is reported from committee without amendments may be placed on third reading.
(b) The third-reading agenda must specify that the legislation rereferred and reported from committee
under subsection (2)(a) was rereferred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee and reported from the
committee without amendments as passed on second reading.
(3) The individual making the rereferral motion shall announce the bill number, short bill title, and the
name of the sponsor of the bill immediately before it may be considered for rereferral.
S50-100. Dividing a question -- segregation excluded. A Senator may request to divide a question if
it includes two or more propositions so distinct in substance that if one thing is taken away a substantive
question will remain. A vote is not required on a request to divide a question, but the chair may rule that a
question is not divisible. The ruling of the chair may be appealed as provided in S20-10 and S20-20. For an
appeal of a ruling of the presiding officer, the question for the Senate must be stated as, "Shall the ruling of the
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
ENROLLED BILL

69th Legislature - 2025 SR 5
chair be upheld?". A motion to segregate pursuant to S50-140(4) is not a request to divide a question.
S50-110. Rules for questions or bills requiring other than a majority vote. (1) Except as provided
in subsection (2), if a question or bill requires more than a majority vote for final passage, a majority vote is
sufficient to decide any question relating to the question or bill prior to third reading.
(2) Any vote in the Senate on a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana Constitution under
circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-thirds vote of
the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote. This rule does not
prevent a committee from indefinitely postponing or tabling a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana
Constitution.
(3) If a bill has been amended in the House of Representatives and the amendments are accepted by
the Senate, the bill must again be placed on third reading in the Senate to determine if the required number of
votes has been cast.
S50-120. Committee reports to Senate -- reconsideration. (1) Reports of standing committees must
be read on Order of Business No. 2, and, if there is no objection to form, are considered adopted. Subject to
subsection (4), debate may not be had on any report.
(2) On an adverse committee report, the sponsor may respond to the chair of the committee making the
report.
(3) Any Senator seeking a reconsideration of the Senate's action on the adoption of a committee report
shall do so on Order of Business No. 9 by motion to reconsider as provided in S50-90. Any Senator may make
the reconsideration motion and need not have voted on the prevailing side. This rule applies notwithstanding
any joint rule to the contrary. Subject to S50-90(6), the reconsideration motion must be made within 1 legislative
day of the adoption of the committee report and is not in order if the bill has been considered in Committee of
the Whole.
(4) (a) Subject to subsection (4)(b), the Rules Committee and conference committees may report at any
time, except during a call of the Senate, when a vote is being taken, or during Committee of the Whole.
(b) The Rules Committee may report during Committee of the Whole on matters referred to the
Committee by the Committee of the Whole.
S50-130. Conference committee -- reports. (1) When a conference committee report is filed with the
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – SR 5
ENROLLED BILL

69th Legislature - 2025 SR 5
Secretary of the Senate, the report must be read under Order of Business No. 3, select committees, and placed
on the calendar the succeeding legislative day for consideration on second reading. If recommended favorably
by the Committee of the Whole, it may be considered on third reading the same legislative day.
(2) If both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopt the same conference committee report
on legislation requiring more than a majority vote for final passage, the Senate, following approval of the
conference committee report on third reading, shall place the final form of the legislation on third reading to
determine if the required vote is obtained.
(3) If the Senate rejects a conference committee report, the committee continues to exist unless
dissolved by the President or by motion. The committee may file a subsequent report.
(4) A Senate conference committee may confer regarding matters assigned to it with any House
conference committee with like jurisdiction and submit recommendations for consideration of the Senate.
S50-135. Adjournment sine die. (1) Subject to Article V, section 10(5), of the Montana Constitution, a
Senator may move that the Senate adjourn for the session.
(2) (a) The motion is debatable and may be made under any order of business except Order of
Business No. 7.

approval of a motion for that purpose.
(2) After a Committee of the Whole has been formed, the President shall appoint a chair to preside.

sponsor shall make an opening statement, proposed amendments must be considered, and then the bill must
be considered in its entirety.

legislation. If the motion prevails, the legislation remains on second reading.
(5) When a Committee of the Whole report on legislation is rejected, the legislation remains on second
reading.

ENROLLED BILL

69th Legislature - 2025 SR 5
be prepared by the staff of the Legislative Services Division, stipulating the date and time of preparation and

for a voice vote to accept or reject a question. If the vote is other than unanimous, the chair may ask that the

amendments.

CHAPTER 7
Nominations from the Governor
S70-10. Nominations -- second term reappointments. (1) The Governor shall nominate and, by and

Governor shall appoint some fit person to discharge the duties of the office until the next meeting of the Senate,
when the Governor shall nominate a person to fill the office.
(3) If the Governor is reelected to a second 4-year term of office, the Governor shall renominate all
retained officers that were previously confirmed pursuant to subsection (1). The Senate confirmation procedure
for a retained officer is the same as the confirmation procedure for a new appointment.

(2) The Secretary shall distribute a copy of the list of nominations and renominations to each Senator.
(3) (a) The President of the Senate shall submit a bill draft request for a resolution for each nominee or

ENROLLED BILL

69th Legislature - 2025 SR 5

individual nominee or group of nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees
being considered by the committee, the committee member may prepare an amendment for executive action to
strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a group of nominees is stricken, the committee
member that offered the amendment shall make a motion to request a committee resolution for the nominee or
nominees to be considered by a separate resolution. A simple majority of the committee is sufficient in order to
request a separate committee resolution.
(3) Within the Committee of the Whole, if a Senator wishes to have an individual nominee or group of
nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees recommended by the committee,
the Senator may prepare a floor amendment to strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a

a bill draft request for that the nominee or nominees to be considered by a separate resolution.
(4) When the resolution for an individual or group nomination has been prepared and introduced, the
committee shall take executive action on the resolution. When a hearing on the separated nomination was held

committee takes action on the separate resolution. After the committee's executive action, the committee chair
shall issue a standing committee report.
(5) The Secretary will read the reports under Order of Business No. 2, reports of standing committees.
(6) After the report has been read, the resolution must be placed on Order of Business No. 7 the next
legislative day for consideration by the Senate. Motions to approve or disapprove of the resolution are in order
and may be debated. Approval upon second reading constitutes confirmation of the Governor's nominee. A
motion to reconsider the approval or disapproval of a nomination made on second reading must occur within
one legislative day. A motion to reconsider may not be made if the resolution approving a confirmation is no
longer in the possession of the Senate.
