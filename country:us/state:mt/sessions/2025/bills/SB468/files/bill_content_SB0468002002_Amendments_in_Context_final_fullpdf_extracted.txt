10 "41-3-202. Action on reporting. (1) (a) Upon receipt of a report that a child is or has been abused or
11 neglected, the department shall promptly assess the information contained in the report and make a
12 determination regarding the level of response required and the timeframe within which action must be initiated.
13 (b) (i) Except as provided in subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (1)(b)(iii), upon receipt of a report that
14 includes an allegation of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation when the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse
15 or sexual exploitation was 12 years of age or older or if the department determines during any investigation that
16 the circumstances surrounding an allegation of child abuse or neglect include an allegation of sexual abuse or
17 sexual exploitation when the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation was 12 years of age
18 or older, the department shall immediately report the allegation to the county attorney of the county in which the
19 acts that are the subject of the report occurred.
20 (ii) If a victim of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation has attained the age of 14 and has sought

1 attorney general.
2 (c) If the department determines that an investigation and a safety and risk assessment are
3 required, a child protection specialist shall promptly conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances
4 surrounding the allegations of abuse or neglect of the child and perform a safety and risk assessment to
5 determine whether the living arrangement presents an unsafe environment for the child. The safety and risk
6 assessment may include an investigation at the home of the child involved, the child's school or day-care
7 facility, or any other place where the child is present and into all other nonfinancial matters that in the discretion
8 of the investigator are relevant to the safety and risk assessment. In conducting a safety and risk assessment
9 under this section, a child protection specialist may not inquire into the financial status of the child's family or of
10 any other person responsible for the child's care, except as necessary to ascertain eligibility for state or federal
11 assistance programs or to comply with the provisions of 41-3-446.
12 (2) An initial investigation of alleged abuse or neglect may be conducted when an anonymous
13 report is received. However, if the initial investigation does not within 48 hours result in the development of
14 independent, corroborative, and attributable information indicating that there exists a current risk of physical or
15 psychological harm to the child, a child may not be removed from the living arrangement. If independent,
16 corroborative, and attributable information indicating an ongoing risk results from the initial investigation, the
17 department shall then conduct a safety and risk assessment.
18 (3) The child protection specialist is responsible for conducting the safety and risk assessment. If
19 the child is treated at a medical facility, the child protection specialist, county attorney, or peace officer,
20 consistent with reasonable medical practice, has the right of access to the child for interviews, photographs,
21 and securing physical evidence and has the right of access to relevant hospital and medical records pertaining
22 to the child. If an interview of the child is considered necessary, the child protection specialist, county attorney,
23 or peace officer may conduct an interview of the child. The interview may be conducted in the presence of the
24 parent or guardian or an employee of the school or day-care facility attended by the child.
25 (4) Subject to 41-3-205 (3), if the child's interview is audiotaped or videotaped, an unedited
26 audiotape or videotape with audio track must be made available, upon request, for unencumbered review by
27 the family.

1 (5) (a) If from the safety and risk assessment the department has reasonable cause to suspect that
2 the child is suffering abuse or neglect, the department may provide emergency protective services to the child,
3 pursuant to 41-3-301, or enter into a written prevention plan, pursuant to 41-3-302, and may provide protective
4 services to any other child under the same care. The department shall:
5 (i) after interviewing the parent or guardian, if reasonably available, document the determinations
6 of the safety and risk assessment; and
7 (ii) notify the child's family of the determinations of the safety and risk assessment, unless the
8 notification can reasonably be expected to result in harm to the child or other person.
9 (b) Except as provided in subsection (5)(c), the department shall destroy all safety and risk
10 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of
11 the 3-year period starting from the date of completion of the safety and risk assessment. If the department
12 determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is substantiated and a court upholds this determination
13 pursuant to [sections 1 through 3], the name of the individual who is the subject of the report may be added to
14 the central registry and the records must be maintained for a period of time not to exceed 25 years.
15 (c) Safety and risk assessment determinations and associated records may be maintained for a
16 reasonable time as defined by department rule under the following circumstances:
17 (i) the safety and risk assessment determines that abuse or neglect occurred;
18 (ii) there had been a previous or there is a subsequent report and investigation resulting in a
19 safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or
20 (iii) an order has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the child as a youth
21 in need of care based on the circumstances surrounding the initial allegations. If the department determines
22 that a report of child abuse or neglect is unsubstantiated, the records must be maintained for 2 years following
23 the close of the investigation.
24 (d) If the department determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is unfounded, the records
25 must be destroyed within 60 days after the close of the investigation.
26 (e) As used in this subsection (5), "substantiated", "unfounded", and "unsubstantiated" have the
27 same meanings as provided in [section 1].

6 safety and risk assessment, including case notes, correspondence, evaluations, videotapes, and interviews, for
7 25 years.
8 (7) Any person reporting abuse or neglect that involves acts or omissions on the part of a public or
9 private residential institution, home, facility, or agency is responsible for ensuring that the report is made to the
10 department.
11 (8) The department shall, upon request from any reporter of alleged child abuse or neglect, verify
12 whether the report has been received, describe the level of response and timeframe for action that the
13 department has assigned to the report, and confirm that it is being acted upon."

2 (c) If the department determines that an investigation and a safety and risk assessment are
3 required, a child protection specialist shall promptly conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances
4 surrounding the allegations of abuse or neglect of the child and perform a safety and risk assessment to
5 determine whether the living arrangement presents an unsafe environment for the child. The safety and risk
6 assessment may include an investigation at the home of the child involved, the child's school or day-care
7 facility, or any other place where the child is present and into all other nonfinancial matters that in the discretion
8 of the investigator are relevant to the safety and risk assessment. In conducting a safety and risk assessment
9 under this section, a child protection specialist may not inquire into the financial status of the child's family or of
10 any other person responsible for the child's care, except as necessary to ascertain eligibility for state or federal
11 assistance programs or to comply with the provisions of 41-3-446.
12 (2) An initial investigation of alleged abuse or neglect may be conducted when an anonymous
13 report is received. However, if the initial investigation does not within 48 hours result in the development of
14 independent, corroborative, and attributable information indicating that there exists a current risk of physical or
15 psychological harm to the child, a child may not be removed from the living arrangement. If independent,
16 corroborative, and attributable information indicating an ongoing risk results from the initial investigation, the
17 department shall then conduct a safety and risk assessment.
18 (3) The child protection specialist is responsible for conducting the safety and risk assessment. If
19 the child is treated at a medical facility, the child protection specialist, county attorney, or peace officer,
20 consistent with reasonable medical practice, has the right of access to the child for interviews, photographs,
21 and securing physical evidence and has the right of access to relevant hospital and medical records pertaining
22 to the child. If an interview of the child is considered necessary, the child protection specialist, county attorney,
23 or peace officer may conduct an interview of the child. The interview may be conducted in the presence of the
24 parent or guardian or an employee of the school or day-care facility attended by the child.
25 (4) Subject to 41-3-205 (3), if the child's interview is audiotaped or videotaped, an unedited
26 audiotape or videotape with audio track must be made available, upon request, for unencumbered review by
27 the family.

1 (5) (a) If from the safety and risk assessment the department has reasonable cause to suspect that
2 the child is suffering abuse or neglect, the department may provide emergency protective services to the child,
3 pursuant to 41-3-301, or enter into a written prevention plan, pursuant to 41-3-302, and may provide protective
4 services to any other child under the same care. The department shall:
5 (i) after interviewing the parent or guardian, if reasonably available, document the determinations
6 of the safety and risk assessment; and
7 (ii) notify the child's family of the determinations of the safety and risk assessment, unless the
8 notification can reasonably be expected to result in harm to the child or other person.
9 (b) Except as provided in subsection (5)(c), the department shall destroy all safety and risk
10 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of
11 the 3-year period starting from the date of completion of the safety and risk assessment. If the department
12 determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is substantiated and a court upholds this determination
13 pursuant to [sections 1 through 3], the name of the individual who is the subject of the report may be added to
14 the central registry and the records must be maintained for a period of time not to exceed 25 years.
15 (c) Safety and risk assessment determinations and associated records may be maintained for a
16 reasonable time as defined by department rule under the following circumstances:
17 (i) the safety and risk assessment determines that abuse or neglect occurred;
18 (ii) there had been a previous or there is a subsequent report and investigation resulting in a
19 safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or
20 (iii) an order has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the child as a youth
21 in need of care based on the circumstances surrounding the initial allegations. If the department determines
22 that a report of child abuse or neglect is unsubstantiated, the records must be maintained for 2 years following
23 the close of the investigation.
24 (d) If the department determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is unfounded, the records
25 must be destroyed within 60 days after the close of the investigation.
26 (e) As used in this subsection (5), "substantiated", "unfounded", and "unsubstantiated" have the
27 same meanings as provided in [section 1].
