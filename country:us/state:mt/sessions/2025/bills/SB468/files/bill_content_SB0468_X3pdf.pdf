- 5 - Authorized Print Version – SB 468
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 468
or sexual exploitation was 12 years of age or older or if the department determines during any investigation that
the circumstances surrounding an allegation of child abuse or neglect include an allegation of sexual abuse or

surrounding the allegations of abuse or neglect of the child and perform a safety and risk assessment to
determine whether the living arrangement presents an unsafe environment for the child. The safety and risk
assessment may include an investigation at the home of the child involved, the child's school or day-care
facility, or any other place where the child is present and into all other nonfinancial matters that in the discretion
of the investigator are relevant to the safety and risk assessment. In conducting a safety and risk assessment
under this section, a child protection specialist may not inquire into the financial status of the child's family or of
any other person responsible for the child's care, except as necessary to ascertain eligibility for state or federal
assistance programs or to comply with the provisions of 41-3-446.
(2) An initial investigation of alleged abuse or neglect may be conducted when an anonymous
report is received. However, if the initial investigation does not within 48 hours result in the development of

psychological harm to the child, a child may not be removed from the living arrangement. If independent,

the child is treated at a medical facility, the child protection specialist, county attorney, or peace officer,
consistent with reasonable medical practice, has the right of access to the child for interviews, photographs,
and securing physical evidence and has the right of access to relevant hospital and medical records pertaining
to the child. If an interview of the child is considered necessary, the child protection specialist, county attorney,
or peace officer may conduct an interview of the child. The interview may be conducted in the presence of the
parent or guardian or an employee of the school or day-care facility attended by the child.
(4) Subject to 41-3-205 (3), if the child's interview is audiotaped or videotaped, an unedited
audiotape or videotape with audio track must be made available, upon request, for unencumbered review by
the family.
(5) (a) If from the safety and risk assessment the department has reasonable cause to suspect that
the child is suffering abuse or neglect, the department may provide emergency protective services to the child,
pursuant to 41-3-301, or enter into a written prevention plan, pursuant to 41-3-302, and may provide protective
services to any other child under the same care. The department shall:
(i) after interviewing the parent or guardian, if reasonably available, document the determinations
of the safety and risk assessment; and
(ii) notify the child's family of the determinations of the safety and risk assessment, unless the
notification can reasonably be expected to result in harm to the child or other person.
(b) Except as provided in subsection (5)(c), the department shall destroy all safety and risk
assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of
the 3-year period starting from the date of completion of the safety and risk assessment.
(c) Safety and risk assessment determinations and associated records may be maintained for a
reasonable time as defined by department rule under the following circumstances:
(i) the safety and risk assessment determines that abuse or neglect occurred;
(ii) there had been a previous or there is a subsequent report and investigation resulting in a
safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or

in need of care based on the circumstances surrounding the initial allegations.
(6) The investigating child protection specialist, within 60 days of commencing an investigation,
shall also furnish a written safety and risk assessment to the department and, upon request, to the family.
Subject to time periods set forth in subsections (5)(b) and (5)(c) , the department shall maintain a record system
documenting investigations and safety and risk assessment determinations. Unless records are required to be
destroyed under subsections (5)(b) and (5)(c), the department shall retain records relating to the safety and risk
assessment, including case notes, correspondence, evaluations, videotapes, and interviews, for 25 years.

private residential institution, home, facility, or agency is responsible for ensuring that the report is made to the
department.
(8) The department shall, upon request from any reporter of alleged child abuse or neglect, verify
whether the report has been received, describe the level of response and timeframe for action that the
department has assigned to the report, and confirm that it is being acted upon."
