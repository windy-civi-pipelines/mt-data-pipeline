11 (b) (i) Except as provided in subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (1)(b)(iii), upon receipt of a report that
12 includes an allegation of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation when the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse
13 or sexual exploitation was 12 years of age or older or if the department determines during any investigation that
14 the circumstances surrounding an allegation of child abuse or neglect include an allegation of sexual abuse or
15 sexual exploitation when the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation was 12 years of age
16 or older, the department shall immediately report the allegation to the county attorney of the county in which the
17 acts that are the subject of the report occurred.
18 (ii) If a victim of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation has attained the age of 14 and has sought
19 services from a contractor as described in 41-3-201 (2)(j) that provides confidential services to victims of sexual
20 assault, conditioned upon an understanding that the criminal conduct will not be reported by the department to

25 reporting occurred, the department or law enforcement shall report as required in subsection (1)(b)(i) to the
26 attorney general.
27 (c) If the department determines that an investigation and a safety and risk assessment are
28 required, a child protection specialist shall promptly conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – SB 468
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0468.3
1 surrounding the allegations of abuse or neglect of the child and perform a safety and risk assessment to
2 determine whether the living arrangement presents an unsafe environment for the child. The safety and risk
3 assessment may include an investigation at the home of the child involved, the child's school or day-care
4 facility, or any other place where the child is present and into all other nonfinancial matters that in the discretion
5 of the investigator are relevant to the safety and risk assessment. In conducting a safety and risk assessment
6 under this section, a child protection specialist may not inquire into the financial status of the child's family or of
7 any other person responsible for the child's care, except as necessary to ascertain eligibility for state or federal
8 assistance programs or to comply with the provisions of 41-3-446.
9 (2) An initial investigation of alleged abuse or neglect may be conducted when an anonymous

18 and securing physical evidence and has the right of access to relevant hospital and medical records pertaining
19 to the child. If an interview of the child is considered necessary, the child protection specialist, county attorney,
20 or peace officer may conduct an interview of the child. The interview may be conducted in the presence of the
21 parent or guardian or an employee of the school or day-care facility attended by the child.
22 (4) Subject to 41-3-205 (3), if the child's interview is audiotaped or videotaped, an unedited
23 audiotape or videotape with audio track must be made available, upon request, for unencumbered review by
24 the family.
25 (5) (a) If from the safety and risk assessment the department has reasonable cause to suspect that
26 the child is suffering abuse or neglect, the department may provide emergency protective services to the child,
27 pursuant to 41-3-301, or enter into a written prevention plan, pursuant to 41-3-302, and may provide protective
28 services to any other child under the same care. The department shall:

1 (i) after interviewing the parent or guardian, if reasonably available, document the determinations

4 notification can reasonably be expected to result in harm to the child or other person.
5 (b) Except as provided in subsection (5)(c), the department shall destroy all safety and risk
6 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of
7 the 3-year period starting from the date of completion of the safety and risk assessment. If the department
8 determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is substantiated and a court upholds this determination
9 pursuant to [sections 1 through 3], the name of the individual who is the subject of the report may be added to
10 the central registry and the records must be maintained for a period of time not to exceed 25 years.
11 (c) Safety and risk assessment determinations and associated records may be maintained for a
12 reasonable time as defined by department rule under the following circumstances:
13 (i) the safety and risk assessment determines that abuse or neglect occurred;
14 (ii) there had been a previous or there is a subsequent report and investigation resulting in a
15 safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or
16 (iii) an order has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the child as a youth
17 in need of care based on the circumstances surrounding the initial allegations. If the department determines
18 that a report of child abuse or neglect is unsubstantiated, the records must be maintained for 2 years following
19 the close of the investigation.
20 (d) If the department determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is unfounded, the records
21 must be destroyed within 60 days after the close of the investigation.
22 (e) As used in this subsection (5), "substantiated", "unfounded", and "unsubstantiated" have the
23 same meanings as provided in [section 1].
24 (6) The investigating child protection specialist, within 60 days of commencing an investigation,
25 shall also furnish a written safety and risk assessment to the department and, upon request, to the family.
26 Subject to time periods set forth in subsections (5)(b) and (5)(c) subsection (5), the department shall maintain a
27 record system documenting investigations and safety and risk assessment determinations. Unless records are

2 25 years.
3 (7) Any person reporting abuse or neglect that involves acts or omissions on the part of a public or
4 private residential institution, home, facility, or agency is responsible for ensuring that the report is made to the
5 department.
6 (8) The department shall, upon request from any reporter of alleged child abuse or neglect, verify
7 whether the report has been received, describe the level of response and timeframe for action that the
8 department has assigned to the report, and confirm that it is being acted upon."
