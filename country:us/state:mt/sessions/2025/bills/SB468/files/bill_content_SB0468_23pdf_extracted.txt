15 attorney general.
16
17 (c) If the department determines that an investigation and a safety and risk assessment are

21 assessment may include an investigation at the home of the child involved, the child's school or day-care
22 facility, or any other place where the child is present and into all other nonfinancial matters that in the discretion
23 of the investigator are relevant to the safety and risk assessment. In conducting a safety and risk assessment

20 services to any other child under the same care. The department shall:
21 (i) after interviewing the parent or guardian, if reasonably available, document the determinations
22 of the safety and risk assessment; and
23 (ii) notify the child's family of the determinations of the safety and risk assessment, unless the
24 notification can reasonably be expected to result in harm to the child or other person.
25
26 (b) Except as provided in subsection (5)(c), the department shall destroy all safety and risk
27 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of
28 the 3-year period starting from the date of completion of the safety and risk assessment.If the department
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – SB 468

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0468.2
1 determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is substantiated and a court upholds this determination
2 pursuant to [sections 1 through 3], the name of the individual who is the subject of the report may be added to
3 the central registry and the records must be maintained for a period of time not to exceed 25 years.
4 (c) Safety and risk assessment determinations and associated records may be maintained for a
5 reasonable time as defined by department rule under the following circumstances:

8 safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or

12 close of the investigation.
13 (d) If the department determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is unfounded, the records
14 must be destroyed within 60 days after the close of the investigation.
15
16 (e) As used in this subsection (5), "substantiated", "unfounded", and "unsubstantiated" have the
17 same meanings as provided in [section 1].
18
19 (6) The investigating child protection specialist, within 60 days of commencing an investigation,
20 shall also furnish a written safety and risk assessment to the department and, upon request, to the family.
