13 determination regarding the level of response required and the timeframe within which action must be initiated.
14 (b) (i) Except as provided in subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (1)(b)(iii), upon receipt of a report that
15 includes an allegation of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation when the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse
16 or sexual exploitation was 12 years of age or older or if the department determines during any investigation that

18 sexual exploitation when the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation was 12 years of age
19 or older, the department shall immediately report the allegation to the county attorney of the county in which the
20 acts that are the subject of the report occurred.
21 (ii) If a victim of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation has attained the age of 14 and has sought
22 services from a contractor as described in 41-3-201 (2)(j) that provides confidential services to victims of sexual
23 assault, conditioned upon an understanding that the criminal conduct will not be reported by the department to
24 the county attorney in the jurisdiction in which the alleged crime occurred, the department may not report

26 (iii) If the department or law enforcement determines that the allegation involves the county
27 attorney or an employee in the county attorney's office in the county in which the acts that are subject to
28 reporting occurred, the department or law enforcement shall report as required in subsection (1)(b)(i) to the
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – SB 468
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0468.3
1 attorney general.
2 (c) If the department determines that an investigation and a safety and risk assessment are
3 required, a child protection specialist shall promptly conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances
4 surrounding the allegations of abuse or neglect of the child and perform a safety and risk assessment to
5 determine whether the living arrangement presents an unsafe environment for the child. The safety and risk
6 assessment may include an investigation at the home of the child involved, the child's school or day-care
7 facility, or any other place where the child is present and into all other nonfinancial matters that in the discretion
8 of the investigator are relevant to the safety and risk assessment. In conducting a safety and risk assessment
9 under this section, a child protection specialist may not inquire into the financial status of the child's family or of
10 any other person responsible for the child's care, except as necessary to ascertain eligibility for state or federal
11 assistance programs or to comply with the provisions of 41-3-446.
12 (2) An initial investigation of alleged abuse or neglect may be conducted when an anonymous

15 psychological harm to the child, a child may not be removed from the living arrangement. If independent,
16 corroborative, and attributable information indicating an ongoing risk results from the initial investigation, the
17 department shall then conduct a safety and risk assessment.

19 the child is treated at a medical facility, the child protection specialist, county attorney, or peace officer,
20 consistent with reasonable medical practice, has the right of access to the child for interviews, photographs,
21 and securing physical evidence and has the right of access to relevant hospital and medical records pertaining
22 to the child. If an interview of the child is considered necessary, the child protection specialist, county attorney,
23 or peace officer may conduct an interview of the child. The interview may be conducted in the presence of the
24 parent or guardian or an employee of the school or day-care facility attended by the child.
25 (4) Subject to 41-3-205 (3), if the child's interview is audiotaped or videotaped, an unedited
26 audiotape or videotape with audio track must be made available, upon request, for unencumbered review by
27 the family.
28 (5) (a) If from the safety and risk assessment the department has reasonable cause to suspect that
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – SB 468
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0468.3
1 the child is suffering abuse or neglect, the department may provide emergency protective services to the child,
2 pursuant to 41-3-301, or enter into a written prevention plan, pursuant to 41-3-302, and may provide protective
3 services to any other child under the same care. The department shall:
4 (i) after interviewing the parent or guardian, if reasonably available, document the determinations
5 of the safety and risk assessment; and
6 (ii) notify the child's family of the determinations of the safety and risk assessment, unless the
7 notification can reasonably be expected to result in harm to the child or other person.
8 (b) Except as provided in subsection (5)(c), the department shall destroy all safety and risk
9 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of
10 the 3-year period starting from the date of completion of the safety and risk assessment. If the department
11 determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is substantiated and a court upholds this determination
12 pursuant to [sections 1 through 3], the name of the individual who is the subject of the report may be added to
13 the central registry and the records must be maintained for a period of time not to exceed 25 years.
14 (c) Safety and risk assessment determinations and associated records may be maintained for a
15 reasonable time as defined by department rule under the following circumstances:
16 (i) the safety and risk assessment determines that abuse or neglect occurred;
17 (ii) there had been a previous or there is a subsequent report and investigation resulting in a
18 safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or
19 (iii) an order has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the child as a youth
20 in need of care based on the circumstances surrounding the initial allegations. If the department determines
21 that a report of child abuse or neglect is unsubstantiated, the records must be maintained for 2 years following
22 the close of the investigation.
23 (d) If the department determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is unfounded, the records
24 must be destroyed within 60 days after the close of the investigation.
25 (e) As used in this subsection (5), "substantiated", "unfounded", and "unsubstantiated" have the
26 same meanings as provided in [section 1].
27 (6) The investigating child protection specialist, within 60 days of commencing an investigation,
28 shall also furnish a written safety and risk assessment to the department and, upon request, to the family.

5 25 years.
6 (7) Any person reporting abuse or neglect that involves acts or omissions on the part of a public or
7 private residential institution, home, facility, or agency is responsible for ensuring that the report is made to the
8 department.
9 (8) The department shall, upon request from any reporter of alleged child abuse or neglect, verify
10 whether the report has been received, describe the level of response and timeframe for action that the

12 neglected, the department shall promptly assess the information contained in the report and make a
13 determination regarding the level of response required and the timeframe within which action must be initiated.
14 (b) (i) Except as provided in subsections (1)(b)(ii) and (1)(b)(iii), upon receipt of a report that
15 includes an allegation of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation when the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse
16 or sexual exploitation was 12 years of age or older or if the department determines during any investigation that
17 the circumstances surrounding an allegation of child abuse or neglect include an allegation of sexual abuse or
18 sexual exploitation when the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation was 12 years of age
19 or older, the department shall immediately report the allegation to the county attorney of the county in which the
20 acts that are the subject of the report occurred.
21 (ii) If a victim of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation has attained the age of 14 and has sought
22 services from a contractor as described in 41-3-201 (2)(j) that provides confidential services to victims of sexual
23 assault, conditioned upon an understanding that the criminal conduct will not be reported by the department to
24 the county attorney in the jurisdiction in which the alleged crime occurred, the department may not report
25 pursuant to 41-3-205 (5)(d) and subsection (1)(b)(i) of this section.
26 (iii) If the department or law enforcement determines that the allegation involves the county
27 attorney or an employee in the county attorney's office in the county in which the acts that are subject to
28 reporting occurred, the department or law enforcement shall report as required in subsection (1)(b)(i) to the
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – SB 468

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0468.3
1 attorney general.
2 (c) If the department determines that an investigation and a safety and risk assessment are
3 required, a child protection specialist shall promptly conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances
4 surrounding the allegations of abuse or neglect of the child and perform a safety and risk assessment to
5 determine whether the living arrangement presents an unsafe environment for the child. The safety and risk
6 assessment may include an investigation at the home of the child involved, the child's school or day-care
7 facility, or any other place where the child is present and into all other nonfinancial matters that in the discretion
8 of the investigator are relevant to the safety and risk assessment. In conducting a safety and risk assessment
9 under this section, a child protection specialist may not inquire into the financial status of the child's family or of

14 independent, corroborative, and attributable information indicating that there exists a current risk of physical or
15 psychological harm to the child, a child may not be removed from the living arrangement. If independent,
16 corroborative, and attributable information indicating an ongoing risk results from the initial investigation, the
