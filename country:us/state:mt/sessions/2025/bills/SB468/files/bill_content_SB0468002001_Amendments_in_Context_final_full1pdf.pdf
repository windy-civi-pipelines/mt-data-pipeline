2 sexual exploitation when the alleged perpetrator of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation was 12 years of age
3 or older, the department shall immediately report the allegation to the county attorney of the county in which the
4 acts that are the subject of the report occurred.
5 (ii) If a victim of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation has attained the age of 14 and has sought
6 services from a contractor as described in 41-3-201 (2)(j) that provides confidential services to victims of sexual
7 assault, conditioned upon an understanding that the criminal conduct will not be reported by the department to

13 attorney general.
14 (c) If the department determines that an investigation and a safety and risk assessment are

16 services to any other child under the same care. The department shall:
17 (i) after interviewing the parent or guardian, if reasonably available, document the determinations

22 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of
23 the 3-year period starting from the date of completion of the safety and risk assessment. If the department

21 private residential institution, home, facility, or agency is responsible for ensuring that the report is made to the
