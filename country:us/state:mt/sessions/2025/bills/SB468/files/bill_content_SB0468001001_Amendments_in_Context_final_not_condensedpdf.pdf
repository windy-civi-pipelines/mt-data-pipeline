2 attorney or an employee in the county attorney's office in the county in which the acts that are subject to
3 reporting occurred, the department or law enforcement shall report as required in subsection (1)(b)(i) to the
4 attorney general.
5 (c) If the department determines that an investigation and a safety and risk assessment are

9 (ii) notify the child's family of the determinations of the safety and risk assessment, unless the
10 notification can reasonably be expected to result in harm to the child or other person.
11 (b) Except as provided in subsection (5)(c), the department shall destroy all safety and risk
12 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of
13 the 3-year period starting from the date of completion of the safety and risk assessment.If the department

16 the central registry and the records must be maintained for a period of time not to exceed 25 years.
17 (c) Safety and risk assessment determinations and associated records may be maintained for a
18 reasonable time as defined by department rule under the following circumstances:
19 (i) the safety and risk assessment determines that abuse or neglect occurred;
20 (ii) there had been a previous or there is a subsequent report and investigation resulting in a
21 safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or
22 (iii) an order has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the child as a youth
23 in need of care based on the circumstances surrounding the initial allegations.If the department determines that
24 a report of child abuse or neglect is unsubstantiated, the records must be maintained for 2 years following the
25 close of the investigation.
26 (d) If the department determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is unfounded, the records
27 must be destroyed within 60 days after the close of the investigation.

7 safety and risk assessment, including case notes, correspondence, evaluations, videotapes, and interviews, for
8 25 years.
9 (7) Any person reporting abuse or neglect that involves acts or omissions on the part of a public or
10 private residential institution, home, facility, or agency is responsible for ensuring that the report is made to the
11 department.
12 (8) The department shall, upon request from any reporter of alleged child abuse or neglect, verify
13 whether the report has been received, describe the level of response and timeframe for action that the
