5 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of

9 the central registry and the records must be maintained for a period of time not to exceed 25 years.
10 (c) Safety and risk assessment determinations and associated records may be maintained for a
11 reasonable time as defined by department rule under the following circumstances:
12 (i) the safety and risk assessment determines that abuse or neglect occurred;

14 safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or
15 (iii) an order has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the child as a youth
16 in need of care based on the circumstances surrounding the initial allegations. If the department determines
17 that a report of child abuse or neglect is unsubstantiated, the records must be maintained for 2 years following
18 the close of the investigation.
19 (d) If the department determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is unfounded, the records
20 must be destroyed within 60 days after the close of the investigation.
21 (e) As used in this subsection (5), "substantiated", "unfounded", and "unsubstantiated" have the
22 same meanings as provided in [section 1].

1 determine whether the living arrangement presents an unsafe environment for the child. The safety and risk
2 assessment may include an investigation at the home of the child involved, the child's school or day-care
3 facility, or any other place where the child is present and into all other nonfinancial matters that in the discretion
4 of the investigator are relevant to the safety and risk assessment. In conducting a safety and risk assessment
5 under this section, a child protection specialist may not inquire into the financial status of the child's family or of
6 any other person responsible for the child's care, except as necessary to ascertain eligibility for state or federal
7 assistance programs or to comply with the provisions of 41-3-446.
8 (2) An initial investigation of alleged abuse or neglect may be conducted when an anonymous
9 report is received. However, if the initial investigation does not within 48 hours result in the development of
10 independent, corroborative, and attributable information indicating that there exists a current risk of physical or
11 psychological harm to the child, a child may not be removed from the living arrangement. If independent,
12 corroborative, and attributable information indicating an ongoing risk results from the initial investigation, the
13 department shall then conduct a safety and risk assessment.
14 (3) The child protection specialist is responsible for conducting the safety and risk assessment. If
15 the child is treated at a medical facility, the child protection specialist, county attorney, or peace officer,
16 consistent with reasonable medical practice, has the right of access to the child for interviews, photographs,
17 and securing physical evidence and has the right of access to relevant hospital and medical records pertaining
18 to the child. If an interview of the child is considered necessary, the child protection specialist, county attorney,
19 or peace officer may conduct an interview of the child. The interview may be conducted in the presence of the
20 parent or guardian or an employee of the school or day-care facility attended by the child.
21 (4) Subject to 41-3-205 (3), if the child's interview is audiotaped or videotaped, an unedited
22 audiotape or videotape with audio track must be made available, upon request, for unencumbered review by
23 the family.
24 (5) (a) If from the safety and risk assessment the department has reasonable cause to suspect that
25 the child is suffering abuse or neglect, the department may provide emergency protective services to the child,
26 pursuant to 41-3-301, or enter into a written prevention plan, pursuant to 41-3-302, and may provide protective
27 services to any other child under the same care. The department shall:

3 notification can reasonably be expected to result in harm to the child or other person.
4 (b) Except as provided in subsection (5)(c), the department shall destroy all safety and risk
5 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of
6 the 3-year period starting from the date of completion of the safety and risk assessment. If the department
7 determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is substantiated and a court upholds this determination
8 pursuant to [sections 1 through 3], the name of the individual who is the subject of the report may be added to
9 the central registry and the records must be maintained for a period of time not to exceed 25 years.
10 (c) Safety and risk assessment determinations and associated records may be maintained for a
11 reasonable time as defined by department rule under the following circumstances:
12 (i) the safety and risk assessment determines that abuse or neglect occurred;
13 (ii) there had been a previous or there is a subsequent report and investigation resulting in a
14 safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or
15 (iii) an order has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the child as a youth
16 in need of care based on the circumstances surrounding the initial allegations. If the department determines
17 that a report of child abuse or neglect is unsubstantiated, the records must be maintained for 2 years following
18 the close of the investigation.
19 (d) If the department determines that a report of child abuse or neglect is unfounded, the records
20 must be destroyed within 60 days after the close of the investigation.
21 (e) As used in this subsection (5), "substantiated", "unfounded", and "unsubstantiated" have the
22 same meanings as provided in [section 1].
23 (6) The investigating child protection specialist, within 60 days of commencing an investigation,
24 shall also furnish a written safety and risk assessment to the department and, upon request, to the family.
25 Subject to time periods set forth in subsections (5)(b) and (5)(c) subsection (5), the department shall maintain a
26 record system documenting investigations and safety and risk assessment determinations. Unless records are
27 required to be destroyed under subsections (5)(b) and (5)(c), the department shall retain records relating to the
