BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:

Section 2:
Section 1. Central registry -- purpose -- determinations. (1) There is established a statewide
central registry to maintain information on individuals who are the subject of substantiated determinations of
child abuse or neglect. The information may be made available during a background check of an individual as
provided for in 41-3-205 and may affect the individual's ability to volunteer or obtain employment or licensure in

ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 468
areas in which the individual may have unsupervised contact with children, such as child care, foster care, or
group home care.
(2) For the purposes of [sections 1 and 2], a determination of child abuse or neglect must be
categorized according to the following definitions:
(a) (i) "Substantiated" means that the department has investigated the reported act of child abuse
or neglect and determined by a preponderance of the evidence that an act of child abuse or neglect occurred.
(ii) The subject of a substantiated determination may be added to the central registry and must be
notified of the consequences of being listed in the central registry, as well as the subject's rights and
procedures for requesting expungement from the central registry.
(b) "Unfounded" means that the department has investigated the reported act of child abuse or
neglect and there is no evidence to corroborate the report.
(c) "Unsubstantiated" means that the department has investigated the reported act of child abuse
or neglect and is unable to determine by a preponderance of the evidence that an act of child abuse or neglect
occurred.

Section 3:
Section 2. Expungement from central registry -- report to legislature. (1) An individual listed in the
central registry may request to have the individual's name expunged from the central registry by submitting a
written request to the department accompanied by an affidavit sworn to by a person with personal knowledge
stating facts sufficient to show that there is good cause for expungement. Good cause includes but is not
limited to:
(a) newly discovered evidence that a substantiated report of child abuse or neglect is inaccurate;
(b) evidence that the requester no longer poses a risk and that no significant public purpose is
served by continued listing of the requester in the state's central registry;
(c) evidence that the underlying case on which the substantiated determination was based was
closed or dismissed, resulting in reunification, and the requester no longer poses a risk to children;
(d) evidence that circumstances that contributed to the finding of abuse or neglect no longer exist;
or
(e) evidence that actions taken by the requester since the incident of abuse or neglect prevent the
reoccurrence of abuse or neglect.

stating facts sufficient to show that there is good cause for expungement as provided in subsection (1).
