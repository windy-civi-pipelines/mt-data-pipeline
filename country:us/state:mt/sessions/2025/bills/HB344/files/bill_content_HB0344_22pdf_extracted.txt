6 (2) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have

20 alcohol and drugs.

26 person charged with the conduct may be prosecuted for a violation of another relevant subsection under
27 subsection (1). However, the person may be convicted of only one offense under this section or of a similar
28 offense under previous laws of this state."

20 (3) The chemical dependency assessment and the chemical dependency education course must

25 course, and chemical dependency treatment and may use health insurance to cover the costs when possible.
26 (4) The assessment must describe the defendant's level of addiction, if any, and contain a
27 recommendation as to education, treatment, or both. The assessment must conform to quality standards
28 required by the department of public health and human services. A defendant who disagrees with the initial

9 appropriate level of treatment based on the determination of one of the counselors.

26 must be followed by monthly monitoring for a period of at least 1 year from the date of admission to the

- 18 - Authorized Print Version – HB 344
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0344.2
1 court shall revoke the suspended sentence, if any, impose any remaining portion of the suspended sentence,
2 and may include additional monthly monitoring for up to an additional 1 year.
