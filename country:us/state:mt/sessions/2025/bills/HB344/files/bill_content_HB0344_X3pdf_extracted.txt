alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the person at the time of a test, as shown by analysis of a sample of the
person's blood, breath, or other bodily substance drawn or taken within a reasonable time after the alleged act,
gives rise to the following inferences:
(a) if there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or less, it may be inferred that the
person was not under the influence of alcohol;
(b) if there was at that time an alcohol concentration in excess of 0.04 but less than 0.08, that fact
may not give rise to any inference that the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol, but the fact
may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the person; and
(c) if there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, it may be inferred that the
person was under the influence of alcohol. The inference is rebuttable.

bearing on the issue of whether the person was under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of
alcohol and drugs.

changed to read "municipality", as an ordinance and is given jurisdiction of the enforcement of the ordinance

(6) When the same acts may establish the commission of an offense under subsection (1), a
person charged with the conduct may be prosecuted for a violation of another relevant subsection under
subsection (1). However, the person may be convicted of only one offense under this section or of a similar
offense under previous laws of this state."

addition to the punishments provided in 61-8-1007 and 61-8-1008, regardless of disposition, a defendant
convicted of a violation of driving under the influence, including 61-8-1002, an offense that meets the definition

the laws of another state shall complete a chemical dependency assessment and:
(a) for a first conviction, except as provided in subsection (8)(b), a chemical dependency education

sentence.
(3) The chemical dependency assessment and the chemical dependency education course must
be completed at a treatment program approved by the department of public health and human services and
must be conducted by a licensed addiction counselor. Approved programs must be evidence-based programs.
The defendant may attend a treatment program of the defendant's choice as long as the treatment services are
provided by a licensed addiction counselor. The defendant shall pay the cost of the assessment, the education
course, and chemical dependency treatment and may use health insurance to cover the costs when possible.
(4) The assessment must describe the defendant's level of addiction, if any, and contain a
recommendation as to education, treatment, or both. The assessment must conform to quality standards
required by the department of public health and human services. A defendant who disagrees with the initial
assessment may, at the defendant's cost, obtain a second assessment provided by a licensed addiction

(5) The treatment provided to the defendant at a treatment program must be at a level appropriate
to the defendant's alcohol or drug problem, or both, as determined by a licensed addiction counselor pursuant
to diagnosis and patient placement rules adopted by the department of public health and human services. The
rules must include evidence-based treatment programs or courses approved by the department that are likely
to reduce recidivism. Upon determination, the court shall order the defendant's appropriate level of treatment. If
more than one counselor makes a determination as provided in this subsection, the court shall order an
appropriate level of treatment based on the determination of one of the counselors.
(6) Each counselor providing education or treatment shall, at the commencement of the education
or treatment, notify the court that the defendant has been enrolled in a chemical dependency education course
or treatment program. If the defendant fails to attend the course or treatment program, the counselor shall notify
the court of the failure.
(7) A court or counselor may not require attendance at a self-help program other than at an open
meeting, as that term is defined by the self-help program. A defendant may voluntarily participate in self-help
programs.

convicted of a violation of driving under the influence, including 61-8-1002, an offense that meets the definition
of aggravated driving under the influence in 61-8-1001, or a similar offense under previous laws of this state or
the laws of another state upon a finding of moderate or severe alcohol or drug use disorder made by a licensed
addiction counselor pursuant to diagnosis and patient placement rules adopted by the department of public
health and human services.

also be required to attend a chemical dependency education course.
(9) (a) On a second or subsequent conviction, the treatment program provided for in subsection (5)
must be followed by monthly monitoring for a period of at least 1 year from the date of admission to the
program.
(b) If a defendant fails to comply with the monitoring program imposed under subsection (9)(a), the
court shall revoke the suspended sentence, if any, impose any remaining portion of the suspended sentence,

ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 344
and may include additional monthly monitoring for up to an additional 1 year.
(10) Notwithstanding 46-18-201(2), whenever a judge suspends a sentence imposed under 61-8-
1007 and orders the person to complete chemical dependency treatment under this section, the judge retains
jurisdiction to impose any suspended sentence for up to 1 year."

(b) An offender is considered to have been previously convicted for the purposes of sentencing if
less than 10 years have elapsed between the commission of the present offense and a previous conviction
unless the offense is the offender's third or subsequent offense, in which case all previous convictions must be
used for sentencing purposes.
(c) A previous conviction for a violation of driving under the influence, including 61-8-1002(1)(a),
(1)(b), (1)(c), or (1)(d), or (1)(f), an offense that meets the definition of aggravated driving under the influence in

number of a subsequent conviction for a violation of driving under the influence under 61-8-1002.
(2) Except as provided in 61-8-1008, the court may order that a term of imprisonment imposed
under 61-8-1007 or 61-8-1008 be served in another facility made available by the county and approved by the
sentencing court. The defendant, if financially able, shall bear the expense of the imprisonment in the facility.
The court may impose restrictions on the defendant's ability to leave the premises of the facility and may
require that the defendant follow the rules of the facility. The facility may be, but is not required to be, a
community-based prerelease center as provided for in 53-1-203. The prerelease center may accept or reject a
defendant referred by the sentencing court.
(3) Subject to the limitations set forth in 61-8-1007 concerning minimum periods of imprisonment,
the court may order that a term of imprisonment imposed under 61-8-1007 be served by imprisonment under
home arrest, as provided in Title 46, chapter 18, part 10.
(4) A court may not defer imposition of sentence under 61-8-1007 or 61-8-1008.

acts alleged to have been committed in violation of 23-2-523(2).
(4) The provisions relating to administration of tests provided in 61-8-1019 and the definition of

(5) As used in 23-2-523(2), the term "under the influence" has the meaning provided in 61-8-
1001."
Section 2. Section 61-2-302, MCA, is amended to read:
"61-2-302. Establishment of driver rehabilitation and improvement program -- participation by
offending drivers. (1) The department may establish by administrative rule a driver rehabilitation and
improvement program or programs. The programs may consist of electronic or classroom instruction in rules of
the road, driving techniques, defensive driving, driver attitudes and habits, actual on-the-road driver's training,

include the requirements for obtaining a restricted probationary driver's license.
(2) Except when otherwise provided or restricted by statute, a person whose driver's license is
suspended or revoked by the department, unless the suspension or revocation was for an offense under 61-8-
1002(1)(a), (1)(b), (1)(c), (1)(d), or (1)(e), or (1)(f), may participate in any driver rehabilitation and improvement
program established under this section if the person's license is:
(a) suspended as a result of a violation of the traffic laws of this state, unless the suspension was
imposed under the authority provided in Title 61, chapter 8, part 8; or
(b) revoked and the person has:

that person complies with the requirements established for the driver rehabilitation and improvement program
and meets the eligibility requirements of subsection (2).
(4) If a person's driver's license has been surrendered before the person's selection for
participation in the driver rehabilitation and improvement program, the license may be returned upon receipt of
the person's agreement to participate in the program.

ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 344
(5) The stay of enforcement of any suspension or revocation action must be terminated and the
suspension or revocation action must be reinstated if a person declines to participate in the driver rehabilitation
and improvement program or fails to meet the attendance or other requirements established for participation in
the program.
(6) This part does not create a right to be included in any program established under this part.
(7) The department may establish a schedule of fees that may be charged to those persons
participating in the driver improvement and rehabilitation program. The fees must be used to help defray costs
of maintaining the program.
(8) A person may be referred to this program by a driver improvement analyst, city judge, justice of
the peace, youth court judge, or judge of a district court of the state.
(9) (a) Except as provided in subsection (9)(b), the department may issue a restricted probationary
license to any person who enrolls and participates in the driver rehabilitation and improvement program. Upon
issuance of a probationary license under this section, the licensee is subject to the restrictions set forth on the
license.
(b) The department may not issue a restricted probationary license that would permit an individual
to drive a commercial motor vehicle during a period in which:
(i) the individual is disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle under state or federal
law; or
(ii) the individual's driver's license or driving privilege is revoked, suspended, or cancelled.
(10) It is a misdemeanor for a person to operate a motor vehicle in any manner in violation of the
restrictions imposed on a restricted license issued to the person under this section."

Section 10. Section 61-8-1009, MCA, is amended to read:
"61-8-1009. Driving under influence -- assessment, education, and treatment required. (1) In
addition to the punishments provided in 61-8-1007 and 61-8-1008, regardless of disposition, a defendant
convicted of a violation of driving under the influence, including 61-8-1002, an offense that meets the definition
of aggravated driving under the influence in 61-8-1001, or a similar offense under previous laws of this state or
the laws of another state shall complete a chemical dependency assessment and:
(a) for a first conviction, except as provided in subsection (8)(b), a chemical dependency education
course; and
(b) for a second or subsequent conviction for a violation of driving under the influence, including
61-8-1002(1)(a), (1)(b), (1)(c), or (1)(d), or (1)(f), an offense that meets the definition of aggravated driving
under the influence in 61-8-1001, or a similar offense under previous laws of this state or the laws of another
state, except a fourth or subsequent conviction for which the defendant completes a residential alcohol
treatment program under 61-8-1008(1)(a)(i), or as required by subsection (8) of this section, chemical
dependency treatment.
(2) The sentencing judge may, in the judge's discretion, require the defendant to complete the
chemical dependency assessment prior to sentencing the defendant. If the assessment is not ordered or
completed before sentencing, the judge shall order the chemical dependency assessment as part of the
sentence.
(3) The chemical dependency assessment and the chemical dependency education course must
be completed at a treatment program approved by the department of public health and human services and
must be conducted by a licensed addiction counselor. Approved programs must be evidence-based programs.
The defendant may attend a treatment program of the defendant's choice as long as the treatment services are
provided by a licensed addiction counselor. The defendant shall pay the cost of the assessment, the education
course, and chemical dependency treatment and may use health insurance to cover the costs when possible.
(4) The assessment must describe the defendant's level of addiction, if any, and contain a
recommendation as to education, treatment, or both. The assessment must conform to quality standards
required by the department of public health and human services. A defendant who disagrees with the initial
assessment may, at the defendant's cost, obtain a second assessment provided by a licensed addiction

counselor or a program approved by the department of public health and human services.
(5) The treatment provided to the defendant at a treatment program must be at a level appropriate
to the defendant's alcohol or drug problem, or both, as determined by a licensed addiction counselor pursuant
to diagnosis and patient placement rules adopted by the department of public health and human services. The
rules must include evidence-based treatment programs or courses approved by the department that are likely
to reduce recidivism. Upon determination, the court shall order the defendant's appropriate level of treatment. If
more than one counselor makes a determination as provided in this subsection, the court shall order an
appropriate level of treatment based on the determination of one of the counselors.
(6) Each counselor providing education or treatment shall, at the commencement of the education
or treatment, notify the court that the defendant has been enrolled in a chemical dependency education course
or treatment program. If the defendant fails to attend the course or treatment program, the counselor shall notify
the court of the failure.
(7) A court or counselor may not require attendance at a self-help program other than at an open
meeting, as that term is defined by the self-help program. A defendant may voluntarily participate in self-help
programs.
(8) (a) Chemical dependency treatment must be ordered for a first-time or second-time offender
convicted of a violation of driving under the influence, including 61-8-1002, an offense that meets the definition
of aggravated driving under the influence in 61-8-1001, or a similar offense under previous laws of this state or
the laws of another state upon a finding of moderate or severe alcohol or drug use disorder made by a licensed
addiction counselor pursuant to diagnosis and patient placement rules adopted by the department of public
health and human services.
(b) If treatment is ordered under subsection (8)(a) for a first-time offender, the offender may not
also be required to attend a chemical dependency education course.
(9) (a) On a second or subsequent conviction, the treatment program provided for in subsection (5)
must be followed by monthly monitoring for a period of at least 1 year from the date of admission to the
program.
(b) If a defendant fails to comply with the monitoring program imposed under subsection (9)(a), the
court shall revoke the suspended sentence, if any, impose any remaining portion of the suspended sentence,
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – HB 344
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 344
and may include additional monthly monitoring for up to an additional 1 year.
(10) Notwithstanding 46-18-201(2), whenever a judge suspends a sentence imposed under 61-8-
1007 and orders the person to complete chemical dependency treatment under this section, the judge retains
jurisdiction to impose any suspended sentence for up to 1 year."

1001, or a similar offense under previous laws of this state or the laws of another state, or a violation of a
similar statute or regulation in another state or on a federally recognized Indian reservation.
(b) An offender is considered to have been previously convicted for the purposes of sentencing if
less than 10 years have elapsed between the commission of the present offense and a previous conviction
unless the offense is the offender's third or subsequent offense, in which case all previous convictions must be
used for sentencing purposes.
(c) A previous conviction for a violation of driving under the influence, including 61-8-1002(1)(a),
(1)(b), (1)(c), or (1)(d), or (1)(f), an offense that meets the definition of aggravated driving under the influence in
61-8-1001, or a similar offense under previous laws of this state or the laws of another state, or a violation of a
similar statute or regulation in another state or on a federally recognized Indian reservation, and as otherwise

conviction for a violation of driving under the influence under 61-8-1002.

conviction for a violation of 45-5-205 or 45-5-628(1)(e) may also be counted for the purposes of determining the
number of a subsequent conviction for a violation of driving under the influence under 61-8-1002.
(2) Except as provided in 61-8-1008, the court may order that a term of imprisonment imposed
under 61-8-1007 or 61-8-1008 be served in another facility made available by the county and approved by the
sentencing court. The defendant, if financially able, shall bear the expense of the imprisonment in the facility.
The court may impose restrictions on the defendant's ability to leave the premises of the facility and may
require that the defendant follow the rules of the facility. The facility may be, but is not required to be, a
community-based prerelease center as provided for in 53-1-203. The prerelease center may accept or reject a
defendant referred by the sentencing court.
(3) Subject to the limitations set forth in 61-8-1007 concerning minimum periods of imprisonment,
the court may order that a term of imprisonment imposed under 61-8-1007 be served by imprisonment under
home arrest, as provided in Title 46, chapter 18, part 10.
(4) A court may not defer imposition of sentence under 61-8-1007 or 61-8-1008.
