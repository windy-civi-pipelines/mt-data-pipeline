10 Section 17. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
11 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
12 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
13 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
14 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
15 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
16 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
17 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
18 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
19 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
20 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
21 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
22 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
23 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
24 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
25 labor.
26 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
27 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,

5 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
6 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
7 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
8 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
9 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
10 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
11 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
12 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
13 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
14 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
15 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
16 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
17 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
18 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
19 following tax year.
20 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
21 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
22 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
23 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
24 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
25 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).

2 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
3 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
4 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
5 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
6 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
7 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7); and
8 (c) may not include revenue distributed to a county to provide state property tax assistance
9 pursuant to [section 28].

12 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
13 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
14 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
15 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
16 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

22 property tax levy for contributions for group benefits excluded under 2-9-212 or 2-18-703;
23 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
