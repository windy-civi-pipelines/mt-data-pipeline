27 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542

Amendment - 2nd Reading/2nd House-tan - Requested by: Katie Zolnikov - (H) Committee of
the Whole
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, SB0542.002.006
1 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
2 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
3 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
4 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
5 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
6 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
7 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
8 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
9 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
10 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
11 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
12 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
13 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
14 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
15 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
16 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
17 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
18 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
19 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
20 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
21 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
22 levied in fiscal year 2026.
23 (4)(3) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
24 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:
25 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
26 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
27 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes

1 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
2 levied in fiscal year 2026.
3 (4) This section does not apply to a charter mill levy that is provided for pursuant to 15-6-134.

10 or mobile home and the parcel on which the long-term rental improvements are located but not including any
11 contiguous or adjacent parcels;
12 (b) that an owner can demonstrate was:
13 (i) rented for periods of 28 days or more for at least 7 months in each tax year for which the rental
14 property reduced tax rate is claimed; or
15 (ii) vacant for not more than 5 months to complete documented property repairs;
16 (c) that is occupied by tenants who use the dwelling as a residence during the year in which the
17 reduced tax rate is claimed; and
18 (d) for which the owner is current on payment of the assessed Montana property taxes when
19 claiming the reduced tax rate.
20 (3) "Owner" includes a purchaser under contract for deed as defined in 70-20-115, a grantor of a
21 trust indenture as defined in 71-1-303, and the trustee of a grantor trust that is revocable as defined in 72-38-
22 103.
23 (4) (a) "Principal residence" means class four residential property:
24 (i) that is a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home,

1 circumstances include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are material in
2 nature and of a character different from the typical or customary, and that are not expected to recur.
3 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
4 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
5 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
6 (2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review
7 provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board
8 and then to the Montana tax appeal board, whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts.
9 An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
10 the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
11 determines that the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate should apply, the
12 department shall adjust the taxable value of the property in accordance with the board's order.

21 specific number of mills that may be imposed in the charter; and
22 (b) levies stated as a specific mill levy authorized by voters before [the effective date of this
23 section] [passage and approval of this act].
24 (2) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the property
25 tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue collected in
26 fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
27 property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue that

1 would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax revenue
2 using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
3 (3) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in
4 revenue from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] to the department of revenue.
5 (4) A reimbursement provided for in this section may only be made for 4 years after [the effective

10 Section 12. Section 15-1-121, MCA, is amended to read:
11 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
12 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
13 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
14 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
15 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
16 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
17 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
18 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
19 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
20 sending a portion to other local governments.
21 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
22 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
23 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),
24 Chapter 584, Laws of 1999;
25 (b) vehicle, boat, and aircraft taxes and fees pursuant to:
