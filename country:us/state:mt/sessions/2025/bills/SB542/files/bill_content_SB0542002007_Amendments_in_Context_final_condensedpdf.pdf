8 2026. Receipt of a notice does not establish that a taxpayer or property owner is eligible to receive the rental

10 property reduced tax rate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of notice, shall apply for a reduced rate as
11 provided in this subsection (2).
12 (c) To receive the rental property reduced tax rate for the tax year in which the application is first

25 any remaining property taxes due for the year in which the rental property reduced tax rate is terminated must
26 be based on the tax rate in effect on January 1 of the year in which the rental property reduced tax rate was
27 terminated.

16 long-term rental or short-term rental from receiving the rental property reduced tax rate.
17 (6) The department shall notify the owner if the rental property reduced tax rate is applied to the
18 property or if the application was denied.

22 department determines that an application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax
23 rate was improperly approved or that the property no longer qualifies for the reduced rate, the department shall
