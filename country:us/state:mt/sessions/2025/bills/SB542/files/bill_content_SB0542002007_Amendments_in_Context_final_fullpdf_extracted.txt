5 by the local government for the dwelling as shown on the 2024 property tax bill received by the taxpayer with a
6 first-half payment due in or around November 2024 and a second-half payment due in or around May 2025.

8 a revocable trust indenture.
9 (3) (a) "Principal residence" means, subject to the provisions of subsection (3)(b), a dwelling:

12 (ii) that is the only residence for which the taxpayer claims the property tax rebate; and
13 (iii) for which the taxpayer made payment of the assessed Montana property taxes during tax year
14 2024.
15 (b) A taxpayer who cannot meet the requirements of subsection (3)(a)(i) because the owner’s
16 principal residence changed during the tax year to another principal residence may still claim the property tax
17 rebate if the taxpayer paid the Montana property taxes while residing in each principal residence for a total of at
18 least 7 consecutive months for the 2024 tax year.
19 (4) "Tax year 2024" means the period January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.
20
21 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Property tax rebate -- penalty for false or fraudulent claim. (1) Except
22 as provided in subsection (2), if the department discovers that a rebate paid to a taxpayer exceeded the amount
23 allowed by [sections 1 through 3], the department may, within 1 year from the date the rebate was transmitted
24 to the taxpayer, assess the taxpayer for the difference. The assessment is subject to the uniform dispute review
25 procedure established in 15-1-211.

3 rate of 12% a year, until paid. If this rebate plus penalty becomes due and owing, the department may issue a

8 Montana property taxes in the amount of $400 or the amount of total property taxes paid, whichever is less, for

10 (2) The rebate provided for in subsection (1) is for Montana property taxes assessed to and paid
11 by a taxpayer or taxpayers on property they owned and occupied as a principal residence during tax year 2024.
12 (3) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by June 30, 2025, for tax year 2024.
13 Receipt of a notice does not establish that a taxpayer or property owner is eligible for a rebate, and a taxpayer

15 notice, shall claim a rebate as provided in subsection (5).
16 (4) Except as provided in subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a

1 (b) Subject to subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a claim for rebate must be submitted, under penalty of
2 false swearing and the penalties provided in [section 2], on a form prescribed by the department and must
3 contain:
4 (i) an affirmation that the claimant owns and maintains the land and improvements as the principal
5 residence as defined in [section 1];
6 (ii) the geocode or other property identifier for the principal residence that the claimant is
7 requesting the rebate on;
8 (iii) the social security number of the claimant and the claimant's spouse; and
9 (iv) any other information as required by the department that is relevant to the claimant's eligibility.
10 (c) The personal representative of the estate of a deceased taxpayer may execute and file the
11 claim for rebate on behalf of a deceased taxpayer who qualifies for the rebate.
12 (d) The trustee of a grantor revocable trust may file a claim on behalf of the trust if the dwelling
13 meets the definition of a principal residence for the grantor.
14 (6) Only one rebate will be issued to a taxpayer for the Montana property taxes paid by the
15 taxpayer for tax year 2024.
16 (7) If a debt is due and owing to the state, the department may offset the rebate in this section as

18 (8) If a property tax rebate is denied by the department, the claimant is entitled to a written
19 explanation why the application was denied. A claimant may make a written appeal of a denial to a
20 management level employee of the department, who shall issue a final decision that is not appealable. Appeals
21 occurring under this subsection (8) are not subject to the provisions contained in 15-1-211.
22 (9) The payment of property tax rebates and administration costs related to paying property tax
23 rebates under this section are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-7-502, from the general fund to the
24 department of revenue for distribution to taxpayers and for related administration costs.

26 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
27 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust

Amendment - 2nd Reading/2nd House-tan - Requested by: Jedediah Hinkle - (H) Committee
of the Whole
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, SB0542.002.007
1 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
2 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
3 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
4 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
5 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
6 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
7 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
8 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
9 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
10 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
11 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
12 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
13 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
14 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
15 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
16 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
17 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
18 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
19 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
20 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
21 levied in fiscal year 2026.
22 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
23 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:
24 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
25 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
26 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
27 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills

3 (b) An owner who cannot meet the requirements of subsection (4)(a)(ii) because the owner’s

5 homestead reduced tax rate if the owner paid the Montana property taxes while residing in each principal

10 for 30 days or less and that is rented for at least 7 months in each tax year for which the reduced tax rate is
11 claimed.

22 claimed. The owner of a principal residence who did not receive a rebate under [sections 1 through 3], shall

7 (b) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by October 30, 2025, for tax year
8 2026. Receipt of a notice does not establish that a taxpayer or property owner is eligible to receive the rental

18 property or if the application was denied.

20 NEW SECTION. Section 8. Homestead and rental property reduced tax rates -- improper
21 approval -- penalty for false or fraudulent application. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), if the
22 department determines that an application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax
23 rate was improperly approved or that the property no longer qualifies for the reduced rate, the department shall

5 base penalty amount calculated under subsection (3)(b) plus interest at the rate provided in 15-16-102
6 calculated from the original due date of the taxes, until paid.
7 (b) The base penalty amount is equal to the property tax due for each year the homestead
8 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate was improperly received, determined using the tax rate
9 provided for in 15-6-134(3)(a), the appraised value, and the mill levies in effect for the year, less the actual
10 property taxes paid in the year.
11 (c) The revised assessment and penalty must be assessed against a person who filed a false or
12 fraudulent application even if the person no longer owns the property.
13 (4) If the person who filed a false or fraudulent application no longer owns the property associated

3 (b) The property owner may request that the department consider extenuating circumstances to
4 grant an application for the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate. Extenuating
5 circumstances include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are material in

7 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
8 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
9 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
10 (2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review
11 provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board
12 and then to the Montana tax appeal board, whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts.
13 An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
14 the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
15 determines that the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate should apply, the
16 department shall adjust the taxable value of the property in accordance with the board's order.

1 (2) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the property
2 tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue collected in
3 fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
4 property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue that
5 would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax revenue
6 using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
7 (3) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in
8 revenue from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] to the department of revenue.
9 (4) A reimbursement provided for in this section may only be made for 4 years after [the effective
10 date of this section].

14 Section 12. Section 15-1-121, MCA, is amended to read:
15 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
16 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
17 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
18 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
19 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
20 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
21 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
22 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
23 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
24 sending a portion to other local governments.
25 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
26 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
27 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),

10 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
11 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
12 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
13 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
14 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
15 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
16 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
17 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
18 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
19 year.
20 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
21 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
22 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
23 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
24 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
25 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
26 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
27 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the

of the Whole
- 2025

1 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
2 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
3 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
4 multiplied by 0.25.
5 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
6 the lesser of:
7 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
8 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
9 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
10 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
11 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
12 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
13 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
14 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
15 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
16 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
17 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
18 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
19 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
20 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
21 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
22 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
23 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
24 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
25 2002.
26 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
27 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts

1 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
2 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
3 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
4 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
5 be calculated separately for:
6 (A) counties;
7 (B) consolidated local governments; and
8 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
9 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
10 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
11 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
12 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
13 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
14 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
15 United States bureau of the census.
16 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
17 follows:
18 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
19 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
20 and
21 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
22 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
23 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
24 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
25 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
26 follows:
27 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's

of the Whole

1 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
2 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
3 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
4 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
5 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
6 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
7 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
8 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
9 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
10 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
11 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
12 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
13 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
14 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
15 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
16 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
17 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
18 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
19 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
20 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
21 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
22 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
23 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
24 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
25 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 11].
26 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
27 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the

1 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
2 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
3 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
4 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
5 financing districts is as follows:
Flathead Kalispell - District 2 $4,638
Flathead Kalispell - District 3 37,231
Flathead Whitefish District 148,194
Gallatin Bozeman - downtown 31,158
Missoula Missoula - 1-1C 225,251
Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
6 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
7 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
8 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
9 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
10 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
11 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
12 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
13 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
14 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
15 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
16 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
17 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
18 (i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and
19 (ii) fails to remit any amounts collected on behalf of the state as required by 15-1-504 or as
20 otherwise required by law within 45 days of the end of a month.

8 electronic form:
9 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
10 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's

16 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
17 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
18 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
19 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the

1 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
2 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
3 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
4 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
5 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
6 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
7 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
8 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
9 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
10 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
11 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
12 for making the adjustment.
13 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and

21 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
22 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
23 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
24 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
25 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
26 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
27 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in

12 (d) The trustee of a grantor revocable trust may file a claim on behalf of the trust if the dwelling
13 meets the definition of a principal residence for the grantor.
14 (6) Only one rebate will be issued to a taxpayer for the Montana property taxes paid by the
15 taxpayer for tax year 2024.
16 (7) If a debt is due and owing to the state, the department may offset the rebate in this section as
17 provided in sections 15-30-2629, 15-30-2630, 17-4-105, or as otherwise provided by law.
18 (8) If a property tax rebate is denied by the department, the claimant is entitled to a written
19 explanation why the application was denied. A claimant may make a written appeal of a denial to a
20 management level employee of the department, who shall issue a final decision that is not appealable. Appeals
21 occurring under this subsection (8) are not subject to the provisions contained in 15-1-211.
22 (9) The payment of property tax rebates and administration costs related to paying property tax
23 rebates under this section are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-7-502, from the general fund to the
24 department of revenue for distribution to taxpayers and for related administration costs.

26 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
27 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust

1 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
2 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
3 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
4 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
5 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
6 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
7 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
8 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
9 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
10 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
11 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
12 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
13 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
14 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
15 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
16 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
17 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
18 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
19 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
20 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
21 levied in fiscal year 2026.
22 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
23 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:
24 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
25 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
26 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
27 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills

7 (b) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by October 30, 2025, for tax year
8 2026. Receipt of a notice does not establish that a taxpayer or property owner is eligible to receive the rental
9 property reduced tax rate, and a taxpayer who does not receive a notice may still be eligible to claim the rental
10 property reduced tax rate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of notice, shall apply for a reduced rate as

13 made, the owner or authorized representative shall apply electronically through the department's website or by

14 require reapplication of 20% of long-term rentals and short-term rentals each year.
15 (5) Periods of short-term vacancy not exceeding 5 months in a 12-month period do not disqualify a
16 long-term rental or short-term rental from receiving the rental property reduced tax rate.

18 property or if the application was denied.

23 rate was improperly approved or that the property no longer qualifies for the reduced rate, the department shall
24 revise the assessment for each year the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate
25 was improperly granted subject to the assessment revision procedure established in 15-8-601.
26 (2) (a) A person who files a false or fraudulent application for a homestead reduced tax rate

1 criminal prosecution under the provisions of 45-7-202.
2 (3) (a) If a person is determined to have filed a false or fraudulent application, the department shall
3 revise the assessment of the property subject to the assessment revision procedure established in this section
4 and 15-8-601 and assess a penalty as provided in this subsection (3). The penalty is equal to three times the
5 base penalty amount calculated under subsection (3)(b) plus interest at the rate provided in 15-16-102
6 calculated from the original due date of the taxes, until paid.
7 (b) The base penalty amount is equal to the property tax due for each year the homestead
8 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate was improperly received, determined using the tax rate
9 provided for in 15-6-134(3)(a), the appraised value, and the mill levies in effect for the year, less the actual
10 property taxes paid in the year.
11 (c) The revised assessment and penalty must be assessed against a person who filed a false or
12 fraudulent application even if the person no longer owns the property.
13 (4) If the person who filed a false or fraudulent application no longer owns the property associated
14 with the false or fraudulent application, the penalty plus interest provided for in subsection (3) may be recovered
15 as any other tax owed the state. If the penalty plus interest becomes due and owing, the department may issue
16 a warrant for distraint as provided in Title 15, chapter 1, part 7.
17 (5) Except as provided in subsection (4), if the department determines that a false or fraudulent
18 application was made, the department shall send the revised assessment with the additional penalty amount as
19 determined under subsection (3) to the county treasurer in the county where the property is located.
20 (6) The county treasurer shall distribute property taxes, penalty, and interest collected under this
21 section proportionally to the affected taxing jurisdictions.

1 department for that purpose in a manner prescribed by the department. The objection must be made no later
2 than 30 days after the date of the denial notification sent pursuant to [section 6(4) or 7(6)].
3 (b) The property owner may request that the department consider extenuating circumstances to
4 grant an application for the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate. Extenuating
5 circumstances include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are material in
6 nature and of a character different from the typical or customary, and that are not expected to recur.
7 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
8 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
9 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
10 (2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review
11 provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board
12 and then to the Montana tax appeal board, whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts.
13 An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
14 the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board

24 (a) levies of a local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a
25 specific number of mills that may be imposed in the charter; and
26 (b) levies stated as a specific mill levy authorized by voters before [the effective date of this

1 (2) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the property
2 tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue collected in
3 fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
4 property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue that
5 would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax revenue
6 using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
7 (3) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in
8 revenue from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] to the department of revenue.
9 (4) A reimbursement provided for in this section may only be made for 4 years after [the effective

15 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
16 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
17 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
18 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
19 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
20 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
21 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
22 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
23 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
24 sending a portion to other local governments.
25 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
26 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:

13 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,

20 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement

22 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
23 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as

22 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
23 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
24 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
25 2002.

2 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
3 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
4 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
5 be calculated separately for:
6 (A) counties;
7 (B) consolidated local governments; and
8 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
9 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
10 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
11 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
12 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
13 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
14 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
15 United States bureau of the census.
16 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
17 follows:
18 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
19 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
20 and
21 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
22 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
23 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
24 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
25 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as

1 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
2 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
3 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
4 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
5 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
6 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
7 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
8 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
9 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
10 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
11 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
12 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
13 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
14 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
15 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
16 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
17 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
18 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
19 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
20 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
21 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
22 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
23 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
24 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
25 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 11].

7 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
8 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
9 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
10 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
11 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
12 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
13 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
14 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
15 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
16 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.

5 second year of the valuation cycle, the taxpayer shall make the objection in writing or by checking a box on the
6 notice no later than June 1 of the second year of the valuation cycle or, if a classification and appraisal notice is
7 received in the second year of the valuation cycle, within 30 days from the date on the notice.

22 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
23 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
24 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a

4 (ii) if the department uses a blend of evaluations developed from various sources, the reasons that
5 the methodology was used.
6 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
7 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
8 electronic form:
9 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
10 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
11 market model area; and
12 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the

14 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
15 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
16 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
17 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
18 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
19 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
20 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
21 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate

1 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
2 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
3 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
4 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
5 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
6 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
7 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
8 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
9 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
10 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
11 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
12 for making the adjustment.
13 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
14 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or

16 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
17 office hours.

20 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
21 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
22 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
23 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
24 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
25 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
26 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
