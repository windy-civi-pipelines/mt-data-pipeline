25 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Definitions. As used in [sections 1 through 3], the following definitions
26 apply:
27 (1) "Montana property taxes" means the ad valorem property taxes, special assessments, and

69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home, or mobile home and as much of the surrounding land, not exceeding
2 1 acre, as is reasonably necessary for its use as a dwelling and that were assessed and paid by the taxpayer
3 for tax year 2024. The amount of Montana property taxes assessed and paid is equal to the total amount billed
4 by the local government for the dwelling as shown on the 2024 property tax bill received by the taxpayer with a
5 first-half payment due in or around November 2024 and a second-half payment due in or around May 2025.
6 (2) "Owned" includes purchasing under a contract for deed and being the grantor or grantors under
7 a revocable trust indenture.
8 (3) (a) "Principal residence" means, subject to the provisions of subsection (3)(b), a dwelling:
9 (i) in which an owner can demonstrate the owner owned and lived for at least 7 months of the
10 year for which the property tax rebate is claimed;
11 (ii) that is the only residence for which the taxpayer claims the property tax rebate; and
12 (iii) for which the taxpayer made payment of the assessed Montana property taxes during tax year
13 2024.
14 (b) A taxpayer who cannot meet the requirements of subsection (3)(a)(i) because the owner’s
15 principal residence changed during the tax year to another principal residence may still claim the property tax
16 rebate if the taxpayer paid the Montana property taxes while residing in each principal residence for a total of at
17 least 7 consecutive months for the 2024 tax year.
18 (4) "Tax year 2024" means the period January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.
19
20 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Property tax rebate -- penalty for false or fraudulent claim. (1) Except
21 as provided in subsection (2), if the department discovers that a rebate paid to a taxpayer exceeded the amount
22 allowed by [sections 1 through 3], the department may, within 1 year from the date the rebate was transmitted
23 to the taxpayer, assess the taxpayer for the difference. The assessment is subject to the uniform dispute review
24 procedure established in 15-1-211.
25 (2) A person who files a false or fraudulent claim for a property tax rebate under [sections 1
26 through 3] is subject to criminal prosecution under the provisions of 45-7-202. If a false or fraudulent claim has
27 been paid by the department, the amount paid may be recovered as any other tax owed the state, together with
28 a penalty of 300% of the rebate claimed and interest on the amount of the rebate claimed plus penalty at the
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542

69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 rate of 12% a year, until paid. If this rebate plus penalty becomes due and owing, the department may issue a
2 warrant for distraint as provided in Title 15, chapter 1, part 7.
3
4 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Property tax rebate -- manner of claiming -- limitations -- appeals --
5 statutory appropriation. (1) Subject to the conditions provided for in [sections 1 through 3], there is a rebate of

7 tax year 2024.
8 (2) The rebate provided for in subsection (1) is for Montana property taxes assessed to and paid
9 by a taxpayer or taxpayers on property they owned and occupied as a principal residence during tax year 2024.
10 (3) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by June 30, 2025, for tax year 2024.
11 Receipt of a notice does not establish that a taxpayer or property owner is eligible for a rebate, and a taxpayer
12 who does not receive a notice may still be eligible to claim a rebate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of
13 notice, shall claim a rebate as provided in subsection (5).
14 (4) Except as provided in subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a
15 multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home, or mobile home and as much of the surrounding land, not
16 exceeding 1 acre that is owned by an entity is not eligible to claim the rebate.
17 (5) (a) (i) All claims for this property tax rebate must be submitted to the department electronically
18 or by mail.
19 (ii) Electronic claims must be submitted between August 15, 2025, and October 1, 2025, through
20 the department's website.
21 (iii) Claims submitted by mail must be made on a form prescribed by the department and
22 postmarked by October 1.
23 (iv) The department may grant an extension of time if the claimant establishes good cause for
24 missing the October 1 deadline. The department's authority to consider an application terminates on December
25 1, 2025, and any applications or requests for extension received after that date may not be processed.
26 (b) Subject to subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a claim for rebate must be submitted, under penalty of
27 false swearing and the penalties provided in [section 2], on a form prescribed by the department and must
28 contain:
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 (i) an affirmation that the claimant owns and maintains the land and improvements as the principal
2 residence as defined in [section 1];
3 (ii) the geocode or other property identifier for the principal residence that the claimant is
4 requesting the rebate on;
5 (iii) the social security number of the claimant and the claimant's spouse; and
6 (iv) any other information as required by the department that is relevant to the claimant's eligibility.
7 (c) The personal representative of the estate of a deceased taxpayer may execute and file the
8 claim for rebate on behalf of a deceased taxpayer who qualifies for the rebate.
9 (d) The trustee of a grantor revocable trust may file a claim on behalf of the trust if the dwelling
10 meets the definition of a principal residence for the grantor.
11 (6) Only one rebate will be issued to a taxpayer for the Montana property taxes paid by the
12 taxpayer for tax year 2024.
13 (7) If a debt is due and owing to the state, the department may offset the rebate in this section as
14 provided in sections 15-30-2629, 15-30-2630, 17-4-105, or as otherwise provided by law.
15 (8) If a property tax rebate is denied by the department, the claimant is entitled to a written
16 explanation why the application was denied. A claimant may make a written appeal of a denial to a
17 management level employee of the department, who shall issue a final decision that is not appealable. Appeals
18 occurring under this subsection (8) are not subject to the provisions contained in 15-1-211.
19 (9) The payment of property tax rebates and administration costs related to paying property tax
20 rebates under this section are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-7-502, from the general fund to the
21 department of revenue for distribution to taxpayers and for related administration costs.
22
23 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
24 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
25 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
26 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
27 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
28 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
2 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
3 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
4 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
5 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
6 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
7 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
8 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
9 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
10 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
11 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
12 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
13 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
14 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
15 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
16 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
17 levied in fiscal year 2026.
18 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
19 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:
20 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
21 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
22 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
23 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
24 levied in fiscal year 2026.
25
26 NEW SECTION. Section 5. Definitions. As used in [sections 5 through 10] and 15-6-134, the
27 following definitions apply:

3 or mobile home and the parcel on which the long-term rental improvements are located but not including any
4 contiguous or adjacent parcels;

13 (3) "Owner" includes a purchaser under contract for deed as defined in 70-20-115, a grantor of a
14 trust indenture as defined in 71-1-303, and the trustee of a grantor trust that is revocable as defined in 72-38-
15 103.
16 (4) (a) "Principal residence" means class four residential property:
17 (i) that is a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home,
18 or mobile home and the parcel on which the principal residence improvements are located but not including any
19 contiguous or adjacent parcels;
20 (ii) in which an owner can demonstrate the owner owned and lived for at least 7 months of the
21 year for which the homestead reduced tax rate for a principal residence is claimed;
22 (iii) that is the only residence for which the owner claims the homestead reduced tax rate for that
23 year; and
24 (iv) for which the owner made payment of the assessed Montana property taxes.
25 (b) An owner who cannot meet the requirements of subsection (4)(a)(ii) because the owner’s
26 principal residence changed during the tax year to another principal residence may still qualify for the
27 homestead reduced tax rate if the owner paid the Montana property taxes while residing in each principal
28 residence for a total of at least 7 consecutive months for each tax year.

21 (ii) the owner no longer uses the dwelling as a principal residence; or

21 entity owner, by an authorized representative of the entity.
22 (b) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by October 30, 2025, for tax year

24 property reduced tax rate, and a taxpayer who does not receive a notice may still be eligible to claim the rental
25 property reduced tax rate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of notice, shall apply for a reduced rate as

13 terminated.
14 (3) An application for a rental property reduced tax rate must be submitted on a form prescribed by
15 the department and must contain:

6 approval -- penalty for false or fraudulent application. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), if the
7 department determines that an application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax
8 rate was improperly approved or that the property no longer qualifies for the reduced rate, the department shall
9 revise the assessment for each year the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate
10 was improperly granted subject to the assessment revision procedure established in 15-8-601.
11 (2) (a) A person who files a false or fraudulent application for a homestead reduced tax rate
12 provided for in [section 6] or for a rental property reduced tax rate provided for in [section 7] is subject to

15 grant an application for the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate. Extenuating
16 circumstances include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are material in

18 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
19 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
20 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.

13 collected in fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between
14 the property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue

18 RESULTING FROM A JUDGMENT LEVY AGAINST THE TAXING ENTITY IN LEVYING PROPERTY TAXES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

2 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
3 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
4 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
5 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
6 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
7 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
8 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
9 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
10 sending a portion to other local governments.

22 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
23 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
24 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
25 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
26 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
27 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
28 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
2 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
3 year.
4 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
5 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
6 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
7 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
8 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
9 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
10 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
11 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
12 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
13 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
14 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
15 multiplied by 0.25.
16 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
17 the lesser of:
18 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
19 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
20 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
21 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
22 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
23 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
24 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
25 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
26 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
27 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
28 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).

69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
2 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
3 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
4 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
5 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
6 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
7 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
8 2002.
9 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
10 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
11 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
12 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
13 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
14 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
15 be calculated separately for:
16 (A) counties;
17 (B) consolidated local governments; and
18 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
19 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
20 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
21 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
22 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
23 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
24 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
25 United States bureau of the census.
26 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
27 follows:
28 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
2 and
3 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
4 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
5 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
6 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
7 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
8 follows:
9 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
10 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
11 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
12 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
13 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
14 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
15 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
16 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
17 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
18 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
19 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
20 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
21 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
22 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
23 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
24 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
25 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
26 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
27 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
28 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
2 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
3 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
4 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
5 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
6 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 11].
7 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
8 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
9 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
10 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
11 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
12 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
13 financing districts is as follows:
Flathead Kalispell - District 2 $4,638
Flathead Kalispell - District 3 37,231
Flathead Whitefish District 148,194
Gallatin Bozeman - downtown 31,158
Missoula Missoula - 1-1C 225,251
Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
14 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
15 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
16 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
17 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
18 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
19 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
20 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
21 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
22 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.

7 electronic form:
8 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;

13 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice

15 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.

17 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
18 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the

20 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate

- 28 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
2 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
3 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
4 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
5 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
6 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
7 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
8 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
9 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
10 for making the adjustment.
11 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
12 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
13 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
14 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
15 office hours.
16 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
17 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
18 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
19 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
20 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
21 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
22 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
23 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
24 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
25 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
26 accordance with the board's order."

20 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
21
22 (Refer to 1st Reading/Second Chamber (Blue) Bill)
23 Strike everything after the enacting clause and insert:
24
25 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Definitions. As used in [sections 1 through 3], the following definitions
26 apply:
27 (1) "Montana property taxes" means the ad valorem property taxes, special assessments, and
28 other fees imposed on property classified under 15-6-134 that is a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a multiple-

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home, or mobile home and as much of the surrounding land, not exceeding
2 1 acre, as is reasonably necessary for its use as a dwelling and that were assessed and paid by the taxpayer
3 for tax year 2024. The amount of Montana property taxes assessed and paid is equal to the total amount billed
4 by the local government for the dwelling as shown on the 2024 property tax bill received by the taxpayer with a
5 first-half payment due in or around November 2024 and a second-half payment due in or around May 2025.
6 (2) "Owned" includes purchasing under a contract for deed and being the grantor or grantors under
7 a revocable trust indenture.
8 (3) (a) "Principal residence" means, subject to the provisions of subsection (3)(b), a dwelling:
9 (i) in which an owner can demonstrate the owner owned and lived for at least 7 months of the
10 year for which the property tax rebate is claimed;
11 (ii) that is the only residence for which the taxpayer claims the property tax rebate; and
12 (iii) for which the taxpayer made payment of the assessed Montana property taxes during tax year
13 2024.
14 (b) A taxpayer who cannot meet the requirements of subsection (3)(a)(i) because the owner’s
15 principal residence changed during the tax year to another principal residence may still claim the property tax
16 rebate if the taxpayer paid the Montana property taxes while residing in each principal residence for a total of at
17 least 7 consecutive months for the 2024 tax year.
18 (4) "Tax year 2024" means the period January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.
19
20 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Property tax rebate -- penalty for false or fraudulent claim. (1) Except
21 as provided in subsection (2), if the department discovers that a rebate paid to a taxpayer exceeded the amount
22 allowed by [sections 1 through 3], the department may, within 1 year from the date the rebate was transmitted
23 to the taxpayer, assess the taxpayer for the difference. The assessment is subject to the uniform dispute review
24 procedure established in 15-1-211.
25 (2) A person who files a false or fraudulent claim for a property tax rebate under [sections 1
26 through 3] is subject to criminal prosecution under the provisions of 45-7-202. If a false or fraudulent claim has
27 been paid by the department, the amount paid may be recovered as any other tax owed the state, together with
28 a penalty of 300% of the rebate claimed and interest on the amount of the rebate claimed plus penalty at the
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 rate of 12% a year, until paid. If this rebate plus penalty becomes due and owing, the department may issue a
2 warrant for distraint as provided in Title 15, chapter 1, part 7.
3
4 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Property tax rebate -- manner of claiming -- limitations -- appeals --
5 statutory appropriation. (1) Subject to the conditions provided for in [sections 1 through 3], there is a rebate of
6 Montana property taxes in the amount of $400 or the amount of total property taxes paid, whichever is less, for
7 tax year 2024.
8 (2) The rebate provided for in subsection (1) is for Montana property taxes assessed to and paid
9 by a taxpayer or taxpayers on property they owned and occupied as a principal residence during tax year 2024.
10 (3) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by June 30, 2025, for tax year 2024.
11 Receipt of a notice does not establish that a taxpayer or property owner is eligible for a rebate, and a taxpayer
12 who does not receive a notice may still be eligible to claim a rebate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of
13 notice, shall claim a rebate as provided in subsection (5).
14 (4) Except as provided in subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a
15 multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home, or mobile home and as much of the surrounding land, not
16 exceeding 1 acre that is owned by an entity is not eligible to claim the rebate.
17 (5) (a) (i) All claims for this property tax rebate must be submitted to the department electronically
18 or by mail.
19 (ii) Electronic claims must be submitted between August 15, 2025, and October 1, 2025, through
20 the department's website.
21 (iii) Claims submitted by mail must be made on a form prescribed by the department and
22 postmarked by October 1.
23 (iv) The department may grant an extension of time if the claimant establishes good cause for
24 missing the October 1 deadline. The department's authority to consider an application terminates on December
25 1, 2025, and any applications or requests for extension received after that date may not be processed.
26 (b) Subject to subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a claim for rebate must be submitted, under penalty of
27 false swearing and the penalties provided in [section 2], on a form prescribed by the department and must
28 contain:
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 (i) an affirmation that the claimant owns and maintains the land and improvements as the principal
2 residence as defined in [section 1];
3 (ii) the geocode or other property identifier for the principal residence that the claimant is
4 requesting the rebate on;
5 (iii) the social security number of the claimant and the claimant's spouse; and
6 (iv) any other information as required by the department that is relevant to the claimant's eligibility.
7 (c) The personal representative of the estate of a deceased taxpayer may execute and file the
8 claim for rebate on behalf of a deceased taxpayer who qualifies for the rebate.
9 (d) The trustee of a grantor revocable trust may file a claim on behalf of the trust if the dwelling
10 meets the definition of a principal residence for the grantor.
11 (6) Only one rebate will be issued to a taxpayer for the Montana property taxes paid by the
12 taxpayer for tax year 2024.
13 (7) If a debt is due and owing to the state, the department may offset the rebate in this section as
14 provided in sections 15-30-2629, 15-30-2630, 17-4-105, or as otherwise provided by law.
15 (8) If a property tax rebate is denied by the department, the claimant is entitled to a written
16 explanation why the application was denied. A claimant may make a written appeal of a denial to a
17 management level employee of the department, who shall issue a final decision that is not appealable. Appeals
18 occurring under this subsection (8) are not subject to the provisions contained in 15-1-211.
19 (9) The payment of property tax rebates and administration costs related to paying property tax
20 rebates under this section are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-7-502, from the general fund to the
21 department of revenue for distribution to taxpayers and for related administration costs.
22
23 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
24 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
25 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
26 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
27 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
28 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
2 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
3 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
4 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
5 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
6 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
7 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
8 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
9 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
10 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
11 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
12 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
13 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
14 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
15 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
16 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
17 levied in fiscal year 2026.
18 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
19 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:
20 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
21 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
22 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
23 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
24 levied in fiscal year 2026.
25
26 NEW SECTION. Section 5. Definitions. As used in [sections 5 through 10] and 15-6-134, the
27 following definitions apply:
28 (1) "Homestead reduced tax rate" means the tax rate provided for in 15-6-134(3)(b)(i).
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 (2) "Long-term rental" means class four residential property:
2 (a) that is a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home,
3 or mobile home and the parcel on which the long-term rental improvements are located but not including any
4 contiguous or adjacent parcels;
5 (b) that an owner can demonstrate was:
6 (i) rented for periods of 28 days or more for at least 7 months in each tax year for which the rental
7 property reduced tax rate is claimed; or
8 (ii) vacant for not more than 5 months to complete documented property repairs;
9 (c) that is occupied by tenants who use the dwelling as a residence during the year in which the
10 reduced tax rate is claimed; and
11 (d) for which the owner is current on payment of the assessed Montana property taxes when
12 claiming the reduced tax rate.
13 (3) "Owner" includes a purchaser under contract for deed as defined in 70-20-115, a grantor of a
14 trust indenture as defined in 71-1-303, and the trustee of a grantor trust that is revocable as defined in 72-38-
15 103.
16 (4) (a) "Principal residence" means class four residential property:
17 (i) that is a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home,
18 or mobile home and the parcel on which the principal residence improvements are located but not including any
19 contiguous or adjacent parcels;
20 (ii) in which an owner can demonstrate the owner owned and lived for at least 7 months of the
21 year for which the homestead reduced tax rate for a principal residence is claimed;
22 (iii) that is the only residence for which the owner claims the homestead reduced tax rate for that
23 year; and
24 (iv) for which the owner made payment of the assessed Montana property taxes.
25 (b) An owner who cannot meet the requirements of subsection (4)(a)(ii) because the owner’s
26 principal residence changed during the tax year to another principal residence may still qualify for the
27 homestead reduced tax rate if the owner paid the Montana property taxes while residing in each principal
28 residence for a total of at least 7 consecutive months for each tax year.

69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 (5) "Rental property reduced tax rate" means the tax rate provided for in 15-6-134(3)(b).
2 (6) "Tax year 2026" means the period from January 1, 2026, through December 31, 2026.
3
4 NEW SECTION. Section 6. Homestead reduced tax rate -- application -- limitations. (1) There is
5 a homestead reduced tax rate provided for in 15-6-134(3)(b)(i) for a principal residence as provided in this
6 section.
7 (2) (a) Beginning in tax year 2026, the owner of a principal residence may apply to the department
8 to receive the homestead reduced tax rate. The owner of a principal residence who applied for and received the
9 rebate provided for in [sections 1 through 3] for tax year 2024 automatically qualifies for the homestead reduced
10 tax rate unless subsections (2)(c)(i) through (2)(c)(iii) apply to the principal residence for which the rebate was
11 claimed. The owner of a principal residence who did not receive a rebate under [sections 1 through 3], shall
12 apply as provided in this section to receive the homestead reduced tax rate in tax year 2026.
13 (b) To receive the homestead reduced tax rate for the tax year in which the application is first
14 made, the owner shall apply electronically through the department's website or by mail on a form prescribed by
15 the department between December 1 of the immediately preceding year and March 1. Applications submitted
16 by mail must be postmarked by March 1. Approved applications received electronically or postmarked after
17 March 1 apply to the following tax year.
18 (c) Once approved, the homestead reduced tax rate remains effective until the end of the tax year
19 in which any of the following events occur:
20 (i) there is a change in ownership of the property;
21 (ii) the owner no longer uses the dwelling as a principal residence; or
22 (iii) the owner applies for a homestead reduced tax rate for a different principal residence.
23 (d) If a homestead reduced tax rate is terminated pursuant to subsection (2)(c) or [section 8], any

13 terminated.
14 (3) An application for a rental property reduced tax rate must be submitted on a form prescribed by

5 NEW SECTION. Section 8. Homestead and rental property reduced tax rates -- improper
6 approval -- penalty for false or fraudulent application. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), if the
7 department determines that an application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax
8 rate was improperly approved or that the property no longer qualifies for the reduced rate, the department shall
9 revise the assessment for each year the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate
10 was improperly granted subject to the assessment revision procedure established in 15-8-601.
11 (2) (a) A person who files a false or fraudulent application for a homestead reduced tax rate

18 calculated from the original due date of the taxes, until paid.
19 (b) The base penalty amount is equal to the property tax due for each year the homestead
20 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate was improperly received, determined using the tax rate

25 (4) If the person who filed a false or fraudulent application no longer owns the property associated
26 with the false or fraudulent application, the penalty plus interest provided for in subsection (3) may be recovered
27 as any other tax owed the state. If the penalty plus interest becomes due and owing, the department may issue
28 a warrant for distraint as provided in Title 15, chapter 1, part 7.

19 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
20 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.

22 provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board
23 and then to the Montana tax appeal board, whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts.
24 An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
25 the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board

3
4 NEW SECTION. Section 11. Reimbursement for loss of revenue from certain fixed mill levies.
5 (1) The department shall reimburse each taxing entity as provided in this section for the revenue loss resulting
6 from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] for the following levies:
7 (a) levies of a local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a

9 (b) levies stated as a specific mill levy authorized by voters before [the effective date of this
10 section].
11 (2) (A) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
12 property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue
13 collected in fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between
14 the property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue
15 that would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax
16 revenue using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
17 (B) A REIMBURSEMENT PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION MUST INCLUDE ANY FINES, PENALTIES, OR DAMAGES

69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
2 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
3 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
4 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
5 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
6 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
7 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
8 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
9 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
10 sending a portion to other local governments.
11 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
12 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
13 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),
14 Chapter 584, Laws of 1999;

21 (o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
22 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
23 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
24 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
25 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
26 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
27 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
28 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
2 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
3 year.
4 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
5 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
6 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
7 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
8 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
9 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
10 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
11 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
12 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
13 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
14 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
15 multiplied by 0.25.
16 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
17 the lesser of:
18 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
19 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
20 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
21 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
22 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
23 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
24 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
25 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
26 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
27 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
28 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).

69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
2 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
3 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
4 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
5 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
6 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
7 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
8 2002.
9 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
10 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
11 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
12 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
13 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
14 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
15 be calculated separately for:
16 (A) counties;
17 (B) consolidated local governments; and
18 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
19 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
20 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
21 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
22 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
23 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
24 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
25 United States bureau of the census.
26 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
27 follows:
28 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
2 and
3 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
4 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
5 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
6 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
7 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
8 follows:
9 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
10 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
11 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
12 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
13 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
14 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
15 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
16 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
17 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
18 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
19 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
20 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
21 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
22 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
23 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
24 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
25 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
26 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
27 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
28 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0542.3
1 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
2 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
3 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
4 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
5 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
6 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 11].
7 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
8 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
9 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
10 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
11 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
12 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
13 financing districts is as follows:
Flathead Kalispell - District 2 $4,638
Flathead Kalispell - District 3 37,231
Flathead Whitefish District 148,194
Gallatin Bozeman - downtown 31,158
Missoula Missoula - 1-1C 225,251
Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
14 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
15 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
16 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
17 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
18 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
19 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
20 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
21 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
22 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.

20 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's

22 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
23 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
24 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board

26 accordance with the board's order."
