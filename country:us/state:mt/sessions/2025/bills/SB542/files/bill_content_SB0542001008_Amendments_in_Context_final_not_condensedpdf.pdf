5 (3) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by June 30, 2025, for tax year 2024.
6 Receipt of a notice does not establish that a taxpayer or property owner is eligible for a rebate, and a taxpayer
7 who does not receive a notice may still be eligible to claim a rebate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of
8 notice, shall claim a rebate as provided in subsection (5).
9 (4) Except as provided in subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a

6 (6) Only one rebate will be issued to a taxpayer for the Montana property taxes paid by the

8 (7) If a debt is due and owing to the state, the department may offset the rebate in this section as
9 provided in sections 15-30-2629, 15-30-2630, 17-4-105, or as otherwise provided by law.
10 (8) If a property tax rebate is denied by the department, the claimant is entitled to a written
11 explanation why the application was denied. A claimant may make a written appeal of a denial to a
12 management level employee of the department, who shall issue a final decision that is not appealable. Appeals
13 occurring under this subsection (8) are not subject to the provisions contained in 15-1-211.
14 (9) The payment of property tax rebates and administration costs related to paying property tax
15 rebates under this section are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-7-502, from the general fund to the
16 department of revenue for distribution to taxpayers and for related administration costs.
17
18 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
19 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
20 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
21 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
22 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
23 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
24 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
25 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
26 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
27 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
28 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, SB0542.001.008
1 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
2 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
3 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
4 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
5 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
6 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
7 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
8 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
9 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
10 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
11 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
12 levied in fiscal year 2026.
13 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
14 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], may:
15 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
16 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
17 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
18 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
19 levied in fiscal year 2026.
20
21 NEW SECTION. Section 5. Reimbursement for loss of revenue from certain fixed mill levies. (1)
22 The department shall reimburse each taxing entity as provided in this section for the revenue loss resulting from
23 the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] for the following levies:
24 (a) levies of a local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a
25 specific number of mills that may be imposed in the charter; and
26 (b) levies stated as a specific mill levy authorized by voters before [the effective date of this
27 section].
28 (2) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the property

Amendment - 1st Reading/2nd House-blue - Requested by: Steve Fitzpatrick - (H) Taxation
- 2025

1 tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue collected in
2 fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
3 property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue that
4 would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax revenue
5 using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
6 (3) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in
7 revenue from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] to the department of revenue.
8 (4) A reimbursement provided for in this section may only be made for 2 years after [the effective
9 date of this section].
10 (5) The department shall distribute the reimbursements with the entitlement share payments under
11 15-1-121(7).
12
13 Section 6. Section 15-1-121, MCA, is amended to read:
14 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
15 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
16 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
17 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
18 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
19 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
20 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
21 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
22 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
23 sending a portion to other local governments.
24 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
25 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
26 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),
27 Chapter 584, Laws of 1999;
28 (b) vehicle, boat, and aircraft taxes and fees pursuant to:

5 (n) state aeronautics fees pursuant to 67-3-101; and
6 (o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
7 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
8 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
9 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
10 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
11 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
12 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
13 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
14 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
15 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
16 year.
17 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
18 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
19 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
20 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
21 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
22 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
23 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
24 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
25 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
26 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
27 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
28 multiplied by 0.25.

1 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
2 the lesser of:
3 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
4 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
5 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
6 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
7 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
8 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
9 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
10 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
11 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
12 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
13 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
14 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
15 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
16 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
17 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
18 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
19 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
20 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
21 2002.
22 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
23 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
24 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
25 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
26 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
27 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
28 be calculated separately for:

1 (A) counties;
2 (B) consolidated local governments; and
3 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
4 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
5 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
6 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
7 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
8 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
9 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
10 United States bureau of the census.
11 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
12 follows:
13 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
14 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
15 and
16 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
17 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
18 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
19 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
20 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
21 follows:
22 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
23 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
24 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
25 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
26 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
27 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.

1 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
2 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
3 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
4 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
5 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
6 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
7 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
8 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
9 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
10 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
11 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
12 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
13 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
14 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
15 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
16 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
17 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
18 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
19 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 5].
20 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
21 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
22 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
23 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
24 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
25 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
26 financing districts is as follows:
