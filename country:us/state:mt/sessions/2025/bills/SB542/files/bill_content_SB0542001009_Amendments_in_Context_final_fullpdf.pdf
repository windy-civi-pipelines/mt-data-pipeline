1 1 acre, as is reasonably necessary for its use as a dwelling and that were assessed and paid by the taxpayer
2 for tax year 2024. The amount of Montana property taxes assessed and paid is equal to the total amount billed
3 by the local government for the dwelling as shown on the 2024 property tax bill received by the taxpayer with a
4 first-half payment due in or around November 2024 and a second-half payment due in or around May 2025.
5 (2) "Owned" includes purchasing under a contract for deed and being the grantor or grantors under

9 year for which the property tax rebate is claimed;
10 (ii) that is the only residence for which the taxpayer claims the property tax rebate; and
11 (iii) for which the taxpayer made payment of the assessed Montana property taxes during tax year
12 2024.
13 (b) A taxpayer who cannot meet the requirements of subsection (3)(a)(i) because the owner’s
14 principal residence changed during the tax year to another principal residence may still claim the property tax
15 rebate if the taxpayer paid the Montana property taxes while residing in each principal residence for a total of at
16 least 7 consecutive months for the 2024 tax year.
17 (4) "Tax year 2024" means the period January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.
18
19 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Property tax rebate -- penalty for false or fraudulent claim. (1) Except
20 as provided in subsection (2), if the department discovers that a rebate paid to a taxpayer exceeded the amount
21 allowed by [sections 1 through 3], the department may, within 1 year from the date the rebate was transmitted
22 to the taxpayer, assess the taxpayer for the difference. The assessment is subject to the uniform dispute review
23 procedure established in 15-1-211.
24 (2) A person who files a false or fraudulent claim for a property tax rebate under [sections 1
25 through 3] is subject to criminal prosecution under the provisions of 45-7-202. If a false or fraudulent claim has

3 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Property tax rebate -- manner of claiming -- limitations -- appeals --
4 statutory appropriation. (1) Subject to the conditions provided for in [sections 1 through 3], there is a rebate of
5 Montana property taxes in the amount of $400 or the amount of total property taxes paid, whichever is less, for
6 tax year 2024.
7 (2) The rebate provided for in subsection (1) is for Montana property taxes assessed to and paid
8 by a taxpayer or taxpayers on property they owned and occupied as a principal residence during tax year 2024.
9 (3) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by June 30, 2025, for tax year 2024.
10 Receipt of a notice does not establish that a taxpayer or property owner is eligible for a rebate, and a taxpayer
11 who does not receive a notice may still be eligible to claim a rebate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of
12 notice, shall claim a rebate as provided in subsection (5).
13 (4) Except as provided in subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a
14 multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home, or mobile home and as much of the surrounding land, not

16 (5) (a) (i) All claims for this property tax rebate must be submitted to the department electronically
17 or by mail.
18 (ii) Electronic claims must be submitted between August 15, 2025, and October 1, 2025, through

1 residence as defined in [section 1];
2 (ii) the geocode or other property identifier for the principal residence that the claimant is
3 requesting the rebate on;
4 (iii) the social security number of the claimant and the claimant's spouse; and
5 (iv) any other information as required by the department that is relevant to the claimant's eligibility.
6 (c) The personal representative of the estate of a deceased taxpayer may execute and file the
7 claim for rebate on behalf of a deceased taxpayer who qualifies for the rebate.
8 (d) The trustee of a grantor revocable trust may file a claim on behalf of the trust if the dwelling
9 meets the definition of a principal residence for the grantor.
10 (6) Only one rebate will be issued to a taxpayer for the Montana property taxes paid by the
11 taxpayer for tax year 2024.
12 (7) If a debt is due and owing to the state, the department may offset the rebate in this section as
13 provided in sections 15-30-2629, 15-30-2630, 17-4-105, or as otherwise provided by law.
14 (8) If a property tax rebate is denied by the department, the claimant is entitled to a written
15 explanation why the application was denied. A claimant may make a written appeal of a denial to a
16 management level employee of the department, who shall issue a final decision that is not appealable. Appeals
17 occurring under this subsection (8) are not subject to the provisions contained in 15-1-211.
18 (9) The payment of property tax rebates and administration costs related to paying property tax
19 rebates under this section are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-7-502, from the general fund to the
20 department of revenue for distribution to taxpayers and for related administration costs.
21
22 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
23 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
24 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
25 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
26 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
27 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
28 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542

Amendment - 1st Reading/2nd House-blue - Requested by: Brandon Ler - (H) Taxation
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, SB0542.001.009
1 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
2 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
3 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
4 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
5 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
6 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
7 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
8 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
9 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
10 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
11 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
12 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
13 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
14 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
15 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
16 levied in fiscal year 2026.
17 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
18 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:
19 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
20 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
21 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
22 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
23 levied in fiscal year 2026.
24
25 NEW SECTION. Section 5. Definitions. As used in [sections 5 through 10] and 15-6-134, the
26 following definitions apply:
27 (1) "Homestead reduced tax rate" means the tax rate provided for in 15-6-134(3)(b)(i).

3 contiguous or adjacent parcels;

9 reduced tax rate is claimed; and
10 (d) for which the owner is current on payment of the assessed Montana property taxes when
11 claiming the reduced tax rate.
12 (3) "Owner" includes a purchaser under contract for deed as defined in 70-20-115, a grantor of a
13 trust indenture as defined in 71-1-303, and the trustee of a grantor trust that is revocable as defined in 72-38-
14 103.
15 (4) (a) "Principal residence" means class four residential property:
16 (i) that is a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home,
17 or mobile home and the parcel on which the principal residence improvements are located but not including any
18 contiguous or adjacent parcels;
19 (ii) in which an owner can demonstrate the owner owned and lived for at least 7 months of the
20 year for which the homestead reduced tax rate for a principal residence is claimed;
21 (iii) that is the only residence for which the owner claims the homestead reduced tax rate for that
22 year; and
23 (iv) for which the owner made payment of the assessed Montana property taxes.
24 (b) An owner who cannot meet the requirements of subsection (4)(a)(ii) because the owner’s
25 principal residence changed during the tax year to another principal residence may still qualify for the
26 homestead reduced tax rate if the owner paid the Montana property taxes while residing in each principal
27 residence for a total of at least 7 consecutive months for each tax year.
28 (5) "Rental property reduced tax rate" means the tax rate provided for in 15-6-134(3)(b).

9 tax rate unless subsections (2)(c)(i) through (2)(c)(iii) apply to the principal residence for which the rebate was

11 apply as provided in this section to receive the homestead reduced tax rate in tax year 2026.
12 (b) To receive the homestead reduced tax rate for the tax year in which the application is first
13 made, the owner shall apply electronically through the department's website or by mail on a form prescribed by
14 the department between December 1 of the immediately preceding year and March 1. Applications submitted
15 by mail must be postmarked by March 1. Approved applications received electronically or postmarked after

19 receive the rental property reduced tax rate. The application must be made by an individual owner or, for an
20 entity owner, by an authorized representative of the entity.
21 (b) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by October 30, 2025, for tax year
22 2026. Receipt of a notice does not establish that a taxpayer or property owner is eligible to receive the rental
23 property reduced tax rate, and a taxpayer who does not receive a notice may still be eligible to claim the rental
24 property reduced tax rate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of notice, shall apply for a reduced rate as
25 provided in this subsection (2).
26 (c) To receive the rental property reduced tax rate for the tax year in which the application is first

6 (iii) the terms of the lease change and the property no longer qualifies as a long-term rental as
7 defined in [section 5]; or
8 (iv) the owner fails to submit a reapplication to the department as required in subsection (4).
9 (e) If a rental property reduced tax rate is terminated pursuant to subsection (2)(d) or [section 8],
10 any remaining property taxes due for the year in which the rental property reduced tax rate is terminated must
11 be based on the tax rate in effect on January 1 of the year in which the rental property reduced tax rate was
12 terminated.
13 (3) An application for a rental property reduced tax rate must be submitted on a form prescribed by
14 the department and must contain:

4 NEW SECTION. Section 8. Homestead and rental property reduced tax rates -- improper
5 approval -- penalty for false or fraudulent application. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), if the
6 department determines that an application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax
7 rate was improperly approved or that the property no longer qualifies for the reduced rate, the department shall

9 was improperly granted subject to the assessment revision procedure established in 15-8-601.
10 (2) (a) A person who files a false or fraudulent application for a homestead reduced tax rate
11 provided for in [section 6] or for a rental property reduced tax rate provided for in [section 7] is subject to

23 fraudulent application even if the person no longer owns the property.
24 (4) If the person who filed a false or fraudulent application no longer owns the property associated

18 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or

8 (b) levies stated as a specific mill levy authorized by voters before [the effective date of this
9 section].
10 (2) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the property
11 tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue collected in
12 fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
13 property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue that
14 would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax revenue
15 using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
16 (3) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in
17 revenue from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] to the department of revenue.
18 (4) A reimbursement provided for in this section may only be made for 4 years after [the effective

24 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
25 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
26 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
27 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and

1 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
2 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
3 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
4 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
5 sending a portion to other local governments.
6 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
7 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
8 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),

17 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
18 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
19 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
20 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
21 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
22 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
23 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
24 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
25 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
26 year.
27 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
28 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, SB0542.001.009
1 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
2 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
3 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
4 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
5 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
6 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
7 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
8 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
9 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
10 multiplied by 0.25.
11 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
12 the lesser of:
13 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
14 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
15 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
16 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
17 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
18 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
19 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
20 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
21 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
22 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
23 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
24 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
25 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
26 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
27 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
28 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each

1 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
2 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
3 2002.
4 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
5 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
6 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
7 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
8 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
9 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
10 be calculated separately for:
11 (A) counties;
12 (B) consolidated local governments; and
13 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
14 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
15 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
16 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
17 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
18 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
19 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
20 United States bureau of the census.
21 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
22 follows:
23 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
24 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
25 and
26 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
27 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
28 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department

1 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
2 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
3 follows:
4 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
5 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
6 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
7 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
8 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
9 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
10 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
11 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
12 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
13 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
14 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
15 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
16 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
17 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
18 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
19 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
20 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
21 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
22 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
23 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
24 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
25 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
26 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
27 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
28 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement

2 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
3 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
4 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
5 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
6 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
7 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
8 financing districts is as follows:
Flathead Kalispell - District 2 $4,638
Flathead Kalispell - District 3 37,231
Flathead Whitefish District 148,194
Gallatin Bozeman - downtown 31,158
Missoula Missoula - 1-1C 225,251
Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
9 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
10 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
11 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
12 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
13 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
14 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
15 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
16 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
17 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
18 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
19 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
20 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
21 (i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and

8 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
9 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
10 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
11 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
12 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the

19 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
20 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
21 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
22 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
23 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
24 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
25 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
26 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
27 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
28 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:

8 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular

12 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
13 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
14 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
15 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
16 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
17 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
18 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
19 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
20 accordance with the board's order."

14 draw attention, a statement that a tax lien is attached to the property, that failure to respond will result in loss of
15 property, and that the taxpayer may contact the county treasurer for complete information.
16 (c) The information required in subsection (2)(a)(vii) may be posted on the county treasurer's
17 website instead of being included on the written notice.

21 notices does not relieve the taxpayer from any tax liability. Any failure to give notice of the tax due for the
22 current year or of delinquent tax will not affect the legality of the tax.
23 (5) If the department revises an assessment that results in an additional tax of $5 or less, an
24 additional tax is not owed and a new tax bill does not need to be prepared."
