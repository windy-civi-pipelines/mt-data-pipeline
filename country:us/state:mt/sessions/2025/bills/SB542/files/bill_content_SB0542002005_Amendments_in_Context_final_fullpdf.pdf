6 unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home, or mobile home and as much of the surrounding land, not exceeding
7 1 acre, as is reasonably necessary for its use as a dwelling and that were assessed and paid by the taxpayer
8 for tax year 2024. The amount of Montana property taxes assessed and paid is equal to the total amount billed
9 by the local government for the dwelling as shown on the 2024 property tax bill received by the taxpayer with a
10 first-half payment due in or around November 2024 and a second-half payment due in or around May 2025.
11 (2) "Owned" includes purchasing under a contract for deed and being the grantor or grantors under
12 a revocable trust indenture.
13 (3) (a) "Principal residence" means, subject to the provisions of subsection (3)(b), a dwelling:
14 (i) in which an owner can demonstrate the owner owned and lived for at least 7 months of the
15 year for which the property tax rebate is claimed;
16 (ii) that is the only residence for which the taxpayer claims the property tax rebate; and
17 (iii) for which the taxpayer made payment of the assessed Montana property taxes during tax year
18 2024.
19 (b) A taxpayer who cannot meet the requirements of subsection (3)(a)(i) because the owner’s
20 principal residence changed during the tax year to another principal residence may still claim the property tax
21 rebate if the taxpayer paid the Montana property taxes while residing in each principal residence for a total of at
22 least 7 consecutive months for the 2024 tax year.
23 (4) "Tax year 2024" means the period January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.

6 a penalty of 300% of the rebate claimed and interest on the amount of the rebate claimed plus penalty at the
7 rate of 12% a year, until paid. If this rebate plus penalty becomes due and owing, the department may issue a

12 Montana property taxes in the amount of $400 or the amount of total property taxes paid, whichever is less, for
13 tax year 2024.
14 (2) The rebate provided for in subsection (1) is for Montana property taxes assessed to and paid
15 by a taxpayer or taxpayers on property they owned and occupied as a principal residence during tax year 2024.
16 (3) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by June 30, 2025, for tax year 2024.

19 notice, shall claim a rebate as provided in subsection (5).
20 (4) Except as provided in subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a

5 (b) Subject to subsections (5)(c) and (5)(d), a claim for rebate must be submitted, under penalty of
6 false swearing and the penalties provided in [section 2], on a form prescribed by the department and must
7 contain:

25 occurring under this subsection (8) are not subject to the provisions contained in 15-1-211.

3 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
4 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
5 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
6 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
7 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
8 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
9 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
10 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
11 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
12 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
13 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
14 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
15 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
16 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
17 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
18 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
19 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
20 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
21 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
22 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
23 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
24 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
25 levied in fiscal year 2026.
26 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
27 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], shall:

1 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
2 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
3 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
4 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
5 levied in fiscal year 2026.

7 NEW SECTION. Section 5. Definitions. As used in [sections 5 through 10] and 15-6-134, the
8 following definitions apply:

10 (2) "Long-term rental" means class four residential property:
11 (a) that is a single-family dwelling unit, unit of a multiple-unit dwelling, trailer, manufactured home,
12 or mobile home and the parcel on which the long-term rental improvements are located but not including any
13 contiguous or adjacent parcels;
14 (b) that an owner can demonstrate was:
15 (i) rented for periods of 28 days or more for at least 7 months in each tax year for which the rental

20 (d) for which the owner is current on payment of the assessed Montana property taxes when
21 claiming the reduced tax rate.
22 (3) "Owner" includes a purchaser under contract for deed as defined in 70-20-115, a grantor of a
23 trust indenture as defined in 71-1-303, and the trustee of a grantor trust that is revocable as defined in 72-38-

25 (4) (a) "Principal residence" means class four residential property:

10 principal residence changed during the tax year to another principal residence may still qualify for the
11 homestead reduced tax rate if the owner paid the Montana property taxes while residing in each principal

22 automatically qualifies for the homestead reduced tax rate and state property tax assistance unless subsections

24 principal residence who did not receive a rebate under [sections 1 through 3], shall apply as provided in this

10 (b) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by October 30, 2025, for tax year

13 its determination by mail or electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting
14 or denying the application.

17 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
18 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
19 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
20 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
21 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
22 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
23 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
24 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
25 year.
26 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
27 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, SB0542.002.005
1 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
2 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
3 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
4 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
5 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
6 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
7 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
8 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
9 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
10 multiplied by 0.25.
11 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
12 the lesser of:
13 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
14 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
15 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
16 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
17 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
18 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
19 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
20 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
21 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
22 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
23 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
24 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
25 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
26 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
27 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each

1 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
2 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
3 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
4 2002.
5 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
6 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
7 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
8 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
9 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
10 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
11 be calculated separately for:
12 (A) counties;
13 (B) consolidated local governments; and
14 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
15 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
16 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
17 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
18 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
19 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
20 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
21 United States bureau of the census.
22 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
23 follows:
24 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
25 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
26 and
27 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each

1 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
2 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
3 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
4 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
5 follows:
6 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
7 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
8 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
9 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
10 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
11 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
12 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
13 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
14 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
15 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
16 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
17 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
18 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
19 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
20 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
21 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
22 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
23 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
24 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
25 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
26 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
27 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).

2 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
3 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
4 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 11].
5 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
6 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the
7 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
8 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
9 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
10 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
11 financing districts is as follows:

Flathead Whitefish District 148,194
Gallatin Bozeman - downtown 31,158

Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
12 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
13 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
14 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
15 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
16 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
17 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.

5 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
6 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the

8 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
9 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
10 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
11 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the

10 Section 17. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
11 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
12 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
13 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
14 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
15 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
16 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
17 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
18 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
19 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
20 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
21 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
22 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
23 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
24 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
25 labor.
26 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
27 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,

5 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
6 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
7 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
8 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
9 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
10 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
11 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
12 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
13 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
14 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
15 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
16 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
17 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
18 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
19 following tax year.
20 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
21 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
22 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
23 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
24 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
25 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).

2 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
3 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
4 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
5 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
6 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
7 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7); and
8 (c) may not include revenue distributed to a county to provide state property tax assistance
9 pursuant to [section 28].

11 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
12 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
13 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
14 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
