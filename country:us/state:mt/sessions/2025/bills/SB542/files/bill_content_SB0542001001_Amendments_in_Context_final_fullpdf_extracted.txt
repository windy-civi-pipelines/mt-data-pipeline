3 to receive the homestead reduced tax rate. The owner of a principal residence who applied for and received the
4 rebate provided for in [sections 1 through 3] for tax year 2024 automatically qualifies for the homestead reduced
5 tax rate unless subsections (2)(c)(i) through (2)(c)(iii) apply to the principal residence for which the rebate was

20 based on the tax rate in effect on January 1 of the year in which the homestead reduced tax rate was
21 terminated.
22 (e) An application for a homestead reduced tax rate must be submitted on a form prescribed by the
23 department and must contain:

11 NEW SECTION. Section 6. Rental property reduced tax rate -- application -- limitations. (1)
12 There is a rental property reduced tax rate provided for in 15-6-134(3)(b) for a long-term rental as provided in

14 (2) (a) Beginning in tax year 2026, the owner of a long-term rental may apply to the department to
15 receive the rental property reduced tax rate. The application must be made by an individual owner or, for an
16 entity owner, by an authorized representative of the entity.
17 (b) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by October 30, 2025, for tax year
18 2026. Receipt of a notice does not establish that a taxpayer or property owner is eligible to receive the rental
19 property reduced tax rate, and a taxpayer who does not receive a notice may still be eligible to claim the rental
20 property reduced tax rate. All taxpayers, regardless of the receipt of notice, shall apply for a reduced rate as
21 provided in this subsection (2).
22 (c) To receive the rental property reduced tax rate for the tax year in which the application is first

1 (ii) the property is no longer rented to tenants as a dwelling;
2 (iii) the terms of the lease change and the property no longer qualifies as a long-term rental as
3 defined in [section 4]; or
4 (iv) the owner fails to submit a reapplication to the department as required in subsection (4).
5 (e) If a rental property reduced tax rate is terminated pursuant to subsection (2)(d) or [section 7],
6 any remaining property taxes due for the year in which the rental property reduced tax rate is terminated must
7 be based on the tax rate in effect on January 1 of the year in which the rental property reduced tax rate was
8 terminated.
9 (3) An application for a rental property reduced tax rate must be submitted on a form prescribed by
10 the department and must contain:
11 (a) a written declaration made under penalty of perjury that the applicant owns and maintains the
12 land and improvements as a long-term rental as defined in [section 4]. The application must state the penalty
13 provided for in [section 7].
14 (b) the geocode or other property identifier for the long-term rental for which the applicant is

26 property or if the application was denied.

28 NEW SECTION. Section 7. Homestead and rental property reduced tax rates -- improper

Amendment - 1st Reading/2nd House-blue - Requested by: Llew Jones - (H) Taxation
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, SB0542.001.001
1 approval -- penalty for false or fraudulent application. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), if the
2 department determines that an application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax
3 rate was improperly approved or that the property no longer qualifies for the reduced rate, the department shall
4 revise the assessment for each year the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate
5 was improperly granted subject to the assessment revision procedure established in 15-8-601.
6 (2) (a) A person who files a false or fraudulent application for a homestead reduced tax rate
7 provided for in [section 5] or for a rental property reduced tax rate provided for in [section 6] is subject to
8 criminal prosecution under the provisions of 45-7-202.
9 (3) (a) If a person is determined to have filed a false or fraudulent application, the department shall
10 revise the assessment of the property subject to the assessment revision procedure established in this section
11 and 15-8-601 and assess a penalty as provided in this subsection (3). The penalty is equal to three times the
12 base penalty amount calculated under subsection (3)(b) plus interest at the rate provided in 15-16-102
13 calculated from the original due date of the taxes, until paid.
14 (b) The base penalty amount is equal to the property tax due for each year the homestead
15 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate was improperly received, determined using the tax rate
16 provided for in 15-6-134(3)(a), the appraised value, and the mill levies in effect for the year, less the actual
17 property taxes paid in the year.
18 (c) The revised assessment and penalty must be assessed against a person who filed a false or
19 fraudulent application even if the person no longer owns the property.
20 (4) If the person who filed a false or fraudulent application no longer owns the property associated
21 with the false or fraudulent application, the penalty plus interest provided for in subsection (3) may be recovered
22 as any other tax owed the state. If the penalty plus interest becomes due and owing, the department may issue
23 a warrant for distraint as provided in Title 15, chapter 1, part 7.
24 (5) Except as provided in subsection (4), if the department determines that a false or fraudulent
25 application was made, the department shall send the revised assessment with the additional penalty amount as
26 determined under subsection (3) to the county treasurer in the county where the property is located.
27 (6) The county treasurer shall distribute property taxes, penalty, and interest collected under this
28 section proportionally to the affected taxing jurisdictions.

1 (7) A revised assessment made under this section must be made within 10 years after the end of
2 the calendar year in which the original application was made.
3
4 NEW SECTION. Section 8. Appeal or denial of reduced tax rate. (1) (a) If the department denies
5 an application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax rate, the owner may request
6 an informal review of the denial by submitting an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
7 department for that purpose in a manner prescribed by the department. The objection must be made no later
8 than 30 days after the date of the denial notification sent pursuant to [section 5(4) or 6(6)].
9 (b) The property owner may request that the department consider extenuating circumstances to
10 grant an application for the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate. Extenuating
11 circumstances include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are material in
12 nature and of a character different from the typical or customary, and that are not expected to recur.
13 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
14 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
15 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
16 (2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review
17 provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board
18 and then to the Montana tax appeal board, whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts.
19 An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
20 the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
21 determines that the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate should apply, the
22 department shall adjust the taxable value of the property in accordance with the board's order.
23
24 NEW SECTION. Section 9. Rulemaking authority. The department shall adopt rules that are
25 necessary to implement and administer [sections 4 through 9].
26
27 NEW SECTION. Section 10. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill
28 levy limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542
Amendment - 1st Reading/2nd House-blue - Requested by: Llew Jones - (H) Taxation
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, SB0542.001.001
1 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
2 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
3 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
4 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
5 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
6 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
7 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
8 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
9 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
10 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
11 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
12 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
13 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
14 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
15 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
16 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
17 (4) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
18 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
19 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
20 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
21 levied in fiscal year 2026.
22 (5) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
23 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], may:
24 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
25 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
26 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
27 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
28 levied in fiscal year 2026.

2 NEW SECTION. Section 11. Reimbursement for loss of revenue from certain fixed mill levies.
3 (1) The department shall reimburse each taxing entity as provided in this section for the revenue loss resulting
4 from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] for the following levies:
5 (a) levies of a local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a
6 specific number of mills that may be imposed in the charter; and
7 (b) levies stated as a specific mill levy authorized by voters before [the effective date of this
8 section].
9 (2) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the property
10 tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue collected in
11 fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
12 property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue that
13 would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax revenue
14 using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
15 (3) A reimbursement provided for in this section may only be made for 2 years after [the effective
16 date of this section].

21 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
22 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
23 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
24 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
25 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
26 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
27 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
28 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,

14 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
15 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
16 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
17 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
18 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
19 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
20 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
21 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
22 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
23 year.
24 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
25 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
26 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
27 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
28 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the

Amendment - 1st Reading/2nd House-blue - Requested by: Llew Jones - (H) Taxation
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, SB0542.001.001
1 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
2 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
3 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
4 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
5 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
6 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
7 multiplied by 0.25.
8 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
9 the lesser of:
10 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
11 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
12 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
13 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
14 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
15 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
16 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
17 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
18 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
19 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
20 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
21 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
22 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
23 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
24 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
25 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
26 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
27 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
28 2002.

1 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
2 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
3 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
4 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
5 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
6 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
7 be calculated separately for:
8 (A) counties;
9 (B) consolidated local governments; and
10 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
11 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
12 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
13 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
14 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
15 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
16 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
17 United States bureau of the census.
18 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
19 follows:
20 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
21 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
22 and
23 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
24 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
25 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
26 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
27 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
28 follows:

1 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
2 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
3 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
4 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
5 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
6 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
7 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
8 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
9 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
10 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
11 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
12 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
13 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
14 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
15 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
16 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
17 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
18 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
19 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
20 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
21 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
22 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
23 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
24 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
25 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
26 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 11].
27 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
28 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the

1 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
2 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
3 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
4 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
5 financing districts is as follows:

Missoula Missoula - 1-1C 225,251
Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
6 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
7 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
8 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
9 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
10 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
11 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
12 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
13 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
14 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
15 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
16 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
17 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
18 (i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and
19 (ii) fails to remit any amounts collected on behalf of the state as required by 15-1-504 or as

16 (B) If a property owner has exhausted the right to object to a valuation, as provided for in
17 subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
18 adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
19 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
20 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
21 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a

1 the methodology was used.
2 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
3 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
4 electronic form:
5 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
6 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
7 market model area; and
8 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the
9 documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.
10 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
11 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
12 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
13 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
14 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
15 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
16 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
17 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
18 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
19 department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
20 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
21 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
22 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
23 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
24 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
25 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
26 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
27 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
28 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must

1 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
2 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
3 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
4 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
5 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
6 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
7 for making the adjustment.
8 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
9 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
10 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
11 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
12 office hours.
13 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
14 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
15 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
16 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
17 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
18 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
19 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
20 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
21 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
22 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
23 accordance with the board's order."

17 (b) The department shall mail a notice to potential claimants by October 30, 2025, for tax year

10 the department and must contain:
11 (a) a written declaration made under penalty of perjury that the applicant owns and maintains the
12 land and improvements as a long-term rental as defined in [section 4]. The application must state the penalty
13 provided for in [section 7].
14 (b) the geocode or other property identifier for the long-term rental for which the applicant is
15 requesting the rental property reduced tax rate;
16 (c) the social security number or taxpayer identification number of the applicant;
17 (d) the income and expense information for the long-term rental for the immediately preceding
18 year, including the amount of rent charged each month; and
19 (e) any other information required by the department that is relevant to the applicant’s eligibility.
20 (4) To continue receiving the rental property reduced tax rate, the owner of a qualifying long-term
21 rental shall reapply as required by the department. Beginning in 2028, the department shall require
22 reapplication of 20% of long-term rentals each year.
23 (5) Periods of short-term vacancy not exceeding 5 months in a 12-month period do not disqualify a
24 long-term rental from receiving the rental property reduced tax rate.
25 (6) The department shall notify the owner if the rental property reduced tax rate is applied to the
26 property or if the application was denied.

1 approval -- penalty for false or fraudulent application. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), if the
2 department determines that an application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax
3 rate was improperly approved or that the property no longer qualifies for the reduced rate, the department shall
4 revise the assessment for each year the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate
5 was improperly granted subject to the assessment revision procedure established in 15-8-601.
6 (2) (a) A person who files a false or fraudulent application for a homestead reduced tax rate
7 provided for in [section 5] or for a rental property reduced tax rate provided for in [section 6] is subject to
8 criminal prosecution under the provisions of 45-7-202.
9 (3) (a) If a person is determined to have filed a false or fraudulent application, the department shall
10 revise the assessment of the property subject to the assessment revision procedure established in this section
11 and 15-8-601 and assess a penalty as provided in this subsection (3). The penalty is equal to three times the
12 base penalty amount calculated under subsection (3)(b) plus interest at the rate provided in 15-16-102
13 calculated from the original due date of the taxes, until paid.
14 (b) The base penalty amount is equal to the property tax due for each year the homestead
15 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate was improperly received, determined using the tax rate
16 provided for in 15-6-134(3)(a), the appraised value, and the mill levies in effect for the year, less the actual
17 property taxes paid in the year.
18 (c) The revised assessment and penalty must be assessed against a person who filed a false or
19 fraudulent application even if the person no longer owns the property.
20 (4) If the person who filed a false or fraudulent application no longer owns the property associated
21 with the false or fraudulent application, the penalty plus interest provided for in subsection (3) may be recovered
22 as any other tax owed the state. If the penalty plus interest becomes due and owing, the department may issue
23 a warrant for distraint as provided in Title 15, chapter 1, part 7.
24 (5) Except as provided in subsection (4), if the department determines that a false or fraudulent
25 application was made, the department shall send the revised assessment with the additional penalty amount as
26 determined under subsection (3) to the county treasurer in the county where the property is located.
27 (6) The county treasurer shall distribute property taxes, penalty, and interest collected under this
28 section proportionally to the affected taxing jurisdictions.

4 NEW SECTION. Section 8. Appeal or denial of reduced tax rate. (1) (a) If the department denies
5 an application for a homestead reduced tax rate or a rental property reduced tax rate, the owner may request
6 an informal review of the denial by submitting an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
7 department for that purpose in a manner prescribed by the department. The objection must be made no later
8 than 30 days after the date of the denial notification sent pursuant to [section 5(4) or 6(6)].
9 (b) The property owner may request that the department consider extenuating circumstances to
10 grant an application for the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate. Extenuating
11 circumstances include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are material in
12 nature and of a character different from the typical or customary, and that are not expected to recur.
13 (c) After the informal review, the department shall determine the correct status of the homestead
14 reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or
15 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
16 (2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review
17 provided for in subsection (1), the property owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board
18 and then to the Montana tax appeal board, whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts.
19 An appeal to the county tax appeal board, pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on
20 the notice of the department's determination. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
21 determines that the homestead reduced tax rate or the rental property reduced tax rate should apply, the
22 department shall adjust the taxable value of the property in accordance with the board's order.

28 levy limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust

Amendment - 1st Reading/2nd House-blue - Requested by: Llew Jones - (H) Taxation
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, SB0542.001.001
1 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
2 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
3 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
4 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
5 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
6 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
7 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
8 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
9 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
10 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
11 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
12 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
13 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
14 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
15 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
16 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
17 (4) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
18 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
19 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
20 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
21 levied in fiscal year 2026.
22 (5) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
23 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section], may:
24 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property
25 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
26 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
27 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
28 levied in fiscal year 2026.

2 NEW SECTION. Section 11. Reimbursement for loss of revenue from certain fixed mill levies.
3 (1) The department shall reimburse each taxing entity as provided in this section for the revenue loss resulting
4 from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] for the following levies:
5 (a) levies of a local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a
6 specific number of mills that may be imposed in the charter; and
7 (b) levies stated as a specific mill levy authorized by voters before [the effective date of this
8 section].
9 (2) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the property
10 tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue collected in
11 fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
12 property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue that
13 would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax revenue
14 using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
15 (3) A reimbursement provided for in this section may only be made for 2 years after [the effective
16 date of this section].
17 (4) The department shall distribute the reimbursements with the entitlement share payments under
18 15-1-121(7).

21 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
22 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
23 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
24 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
25 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
26 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
27 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
28 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,

1 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
2 sending a portion to other local governments.
3 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
4 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
5 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),
6 Chapter 584, Laws of 1999;
7 (b) vehicle, boat, and aircraft taxes and fees pursuant to:

12 (n) state aeronautics fees pursuant to 67-3-101; and
13 (o) department of natural resources and conservation payments in lieu of taxes pursuant to former
14 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
15 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
16 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
17 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
18 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
19 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
20 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
21 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
22 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
23 year.
24 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
25 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
26 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
27 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
28 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – SB 542

Amendment - 1st Reading/2nd House-blue - Requested by: Llew Jones - (H) Taxation
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, SB0542.001.001
1 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
2 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
3 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the
4 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
5 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
6 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
7 multiplied by 0.25.
8 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
9 the lesser of:
10 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
11 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
12 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
13 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
14 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
15 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
16 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
17 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
18 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
19 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
20 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
21 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
22 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
23 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
24 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
25 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
26 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
27 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
28 2002.

2 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts
3 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
4 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
5 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
6 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
7 be calculated separately for:
8 (A) counties;
9 (B) consolidated local governments; and
10 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
11 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
12 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
13 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
14 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
15 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
16 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
17 United States bureau of the census.
18 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
19 follows:
20 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
21 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
22 and
23 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
24 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
25 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
26 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
27 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
28 follows:

1 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's
2 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
3 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
4 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
5 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
6 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
7 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
8 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
9 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
10 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
11 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
12 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
13 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
14 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
15 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
16 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
17 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
18 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
19 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
20 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
21 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
22 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
23 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
24 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
25 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
26 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 11].
27 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),

1 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
2 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
3 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
4 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
5 financing districts is as follows:

Missoula Missoula - 1-1C 225,251
Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
6 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
7 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
8 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
9 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
10 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
11 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
12 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
13 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
14 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
15 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
16 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
17 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
18 (i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and

25 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
26 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
27 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
28 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must

4 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
5 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
6 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
7 for making the adjustment.

16 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
17 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
18 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
19 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
20 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
21 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
22 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
23 accordance with the board's order."
