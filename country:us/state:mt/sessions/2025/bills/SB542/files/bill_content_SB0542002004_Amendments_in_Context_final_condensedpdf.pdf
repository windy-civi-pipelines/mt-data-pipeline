3 electronically. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for accepting or denying the application.
4 (2) If a property owner is aggrieved by the determination made by the department after the review

3 (3) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in

11 Section 12. Section 15-1-121, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
13 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
14 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
15 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
16 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
17 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
18 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
19 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
20 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
21 sending a portion to other local governments.
22 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
23 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
24 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),
25 Chapter 584, Laws of 1999;
26 (b) vehicle, boat, and aircraft taxes and fees pursuant to:
27 (i) Title 23, chapter 2, part 5;
