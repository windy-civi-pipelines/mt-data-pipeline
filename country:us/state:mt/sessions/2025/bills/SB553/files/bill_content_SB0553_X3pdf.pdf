revenue in accordance with subsection (10)(a) and identify large customers, if any, who are not in compliance
with reporting requirements in accordance with this subsection (8) and subsection (10).
(9) A utility or large customer filing for a credit shall develop and maintain appropriate
documentation to support the utility's or the large customer's claim for the credit.
(10) (a) A large customer claiming credits for a calendar year shall submit an annual summary
report of its universal system benefits programs activities and expenditures to the department of revenue and to
the large customer's utility. The department shall annually make the reports available to the energy and
telecommunications technology interim committee in accordance with 5-11-210. A report must be filed with the
department even if a large customer is being reimbursed for a prior year's project. The annual report of a large
customer must identify each qualifying project or expenditure for which it has claimed a credit and the amount
of the credit. Prior approval by the utility is not required, except as provided in subsection (10)(b).
(b) If a large customer claims a credit that the department of revenue disallows in whole or in part,
the large customer is financially responsible for the disallowance. A large customer and the large customer's
utility may mutually agree that credits claimed by the large customer be first approved by the utility. If the utility
approves the large customer credit, the utility may be financially responsible for any subsequent disallowance.
(11) A public utility with fewer than 50 customers is exempt from the requirements of this section."

(2) When a subdivision is located totally within an area for which density requirements have been

governing body may establish park dedication requirements based on the community need for parks and the
development densities identified in the growth policy or regulations. Park dedication requirements established

dwelling unit.
(3) A park dedication may not be required for:

required, the cash donation may not exceed the proportional amount not covered by the land donation.
(5) (a) In accordance with the provisions of subsections (5)(b) and (5)(c), the governing body shall
use the dedicated money or land for development, acquisition, or maintenance of parks to serve the
subdivision.
(b) The governing body may use the dedicated money to acquire, develop, or maintain, within its
jurisdiction, parks or recreational areas or for the purchase of public open space or conservation easements
only if:
(i) the park, recreational area, open space, or conservation easement is within a reasonably close
proximity to the proposed subdivision; and
(ii) the governing body has formally adopted a park plan that establishes the needs and
procedures for use of the money.
(c) The governing body may not use more than 50% of the dedicated money for park
