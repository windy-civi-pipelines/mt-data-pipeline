12 provides essential protections to firearms manufacturers and sellers against certain lawsuits arising from the
13 criminal or unlawful misuse of their products; and
14 WHEREAS, the predicate exception within the PLCAA allows for certain lawsuits to proceed if the
15 defendant knowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms and the

20 PLCAA, effectively swallowing the rule by allowing general statutes to circumvent the PLCAA's protections; and

8 ensuring the claims are based on clear and concrete statutory violations specific to firearm sales and
9 marketing.

12 indicates otherwise, the following definitions apply:
13 (1) "Firearm" means a weapon that will, is designed to, or may readily be converted to expel a
14 projectile by the action of an explosive, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(3).
15 (2) "Manufacturer" means a person engaged in the business of manufacturing firearms or
16 ammunition for sale or distribution.

18 manufacturer or seller that directly poses a foreseeable and substantial risk of harm to the purchaser or specific
19 identifiable individuals.

10 (b) provides clear, concrete requirements that the manufacturer or seller failed to meet, which
11 directly caused the harm in question.
12 (2) General state consumer protection laws or public nuisance laws may not be considered as
13 statutes applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms or ammunition for the purposes of the predicate
14 exception.

16 allowing general statutes to circumvent the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, 15 U.S.C. 7901, et
