WHEREAS, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. 7901, et seq.,
provides essential protections to firearms manufacturers and sellers against certain lawsuits arising from the
criminal or unlawful misuse of their products; and
WHEREAS, the predicate exception within the PLCAA allows for certain lawsuits to proceed if the
defendant knowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms and the
violation was a proximate cause of the harm; and
WHEREAS, recent litigation in the United States has demonstrated attempts to circumvent the
protections of the PLCAA through broad interpretations of the predicate exception; and
WHEREAS, a broad interpretation of the predicate exception could undermine the purpose of the
PLCAA, effectively swallowing the rule by allowing general statutes to circumvent the PLCAA's protections; and
WHEREAS, this legislation aims to prevent judicial activism or jury verdicts based on emotion or
political leanings, ensuring that manufacturers are not unfairly punished because their products were illegally
used by criminals.

intended protections in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, 15 U.S.C. 7901, et seq.; and
(3) define the circumstances under which negligent marketing claims can be pursued in this state,
ensuring the claims are based on clear and concrete statutory violations specific to firearm sales and
marketing.

Section 4:
Section 3. Definitions. As used in [sections 1 through 7], unless the context clearly indicates
otherwise, the following definitions apply:
(1) "Firearm" means a weapon that will, is designed to, or may readily be converted to expel a
projectile by the action of an explosive, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(3).
(2) "Manufacturer" means a person engaged in the business of manufacturing firearms or

identifiable individuals.

wholesale or retail.

Section 5:
Section 4. Limitations on negligent marketing claims. It is unlawful for a person to bring a
negligent marketing claim against a manufacturer or seller of firearms or ammunition unless all of the following

suffered by the plaintiff; and
(4) the marketing practice violated a state or federal statute explicitly regulating the sale or
marketing of firearms or ammunition in a manner that constitutes a willful and knowing violation of the law.

Section 6:
Section 5. Predicate exception limitation. (1) The predicate exception under the Protection of
Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, 15 U.S.C. 7901, et seq., may not be interpreted broadly. A claim may only
proceed if the specific statute cited as being violated:
(a) explicitly regulates firearms or ammunition; and
(b) provides clear, concrete requirements that the manufacturer or seller failed to meet, which
directly caused the harm in question.
(2) General state consumer protection laws or public nuisance laws may not be considered as
statutes applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms or ammunition for the purposes of the predicate
exception.
(3) A broad interpretation of the predicate exception, which could effectively replace the law by
allowing general statutes to circumvent the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, 15 U.S.C. 7901, et
seq., must be explicitly rejected.

Section 7:
Section 6. Enforcement and penalties. (1) The attorney general is authorized to enforce the
provisions of [sections 1 through 7].

claim brought in violation of [section 4] may bring a civil action for damages and injunctive relief.
(2) A plaintiff who prevails in an action brought pursuant to this section is entitled to recover
reasonable attorney fees and costs.
