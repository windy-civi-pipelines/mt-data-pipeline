12 Section 4. Section 85-2-402, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "85-2-402. Changes in appropriation rights -- definition. (1) (a) The right to make a change in
14 appropriation right subject to the provisions of this section in an existing water right, a permit, or a state water
15 reservation is recognized and confirmed. In a change in appropriation right proceeding under this section, there
16 is no presumption that an applicant for a change in appropriation right cannot establish lack of adverse effect
17 prior to the adjudication of other rights in the source of supply pursuant to this chapter. Except as provided in
18 85-2-410 and subsections (15) and (16) of this section [section 1], an appropriator may not make a change in
19 an appropriation right without the approval of the department or, if applicable, of the legislature. An applicant

1 proves by a preponderance of evidence that the following criteria are met:
2 (a) The proposed change in appropriation right will not adversely affect the use of the existing
3 water rights of other persons or other perfected or planned uses or developments for which a permit or
4 certificate has been issued or for which a state water reservation has been issued under part 3. For purposes of
5 this section, adverse effects analysis is specific to the proposed change in appropriation right and a
6 determination that water is not legally available pursuant to 85-2-311 does not necessarily mean that an
7 adverse effect will occur.
8 (b) The proposed means of diversion, construction, and operation of the appropriation works are
9 adequate, except for:
10 (i) a change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-320 or 85-2-436;
11 (ii) a temporary change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-408; or
12 (iii) a change in appropriation right pursuant to 85-2-420 for mitigation or marketing for mitigation.
13 (c) The proposed use of water is a beneficial use.
14 (d) The applicant has a possessory interest, or the written consent of the person with the
15 possessory interest, in the property where the water is to be put to beneficial use or, if the proposed change
16 involves a point of diversion, conveyance, or place of use on national forest system lands, the applicant has any
17 written special use authorization required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands
18 for the purpose of diversion, impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water.
19 This subsection (2)(d) does not apply to:
20 (i) a change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-320 or 85-2-436;
21 (ii) a temporary change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-408; or
22 (iii) a change in appropriation right pursuant to 85-2-420 for mitigation or marketing for mitigation.
23 (e) If the change in appropriation right involves salvaged water, the proposed water-saving
24 methods will salvage at least the amount of water asserted by the applicant.
25 (f) The water quality of an appropriator will not be adversely affected.
26 (g) The ability of a discharge permitholder to satisfy effluent limitations of a permit issued in
27 accordance with Title 75, chapter 5, part 4, will not be adversely affected.

1 (3) The applicant is required to prove that the criteria in subsections (2)(f) and (2)(g) have been
2 met only if a valid objection is filed. A valid objection must contain substantial credible information establishing
3 to the satisfaction of the department that the criteria in subsection (2)(f) or (2)(g), as applicable, may not be met.
4 (4) The department may not approve a change in purpose of use or place of use of an
5 appropriation of 4,000 or more acre-feet of water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water unless
6 the appropriator proves by a preponderance of evidence that:
7 (a) the criteria in subsection (2) are met; and
8 (b) the proposed change in appropriation right is a reasonable use. A finding of reasonable use
9 must be based on a consideration of:
10 (i) the existing legal demands of water rights on the state water supply, as well as projected legal
11 demands of water rights for future beneficial purposes, including municipal water supplies, irrigation systems,
12 and minimum streamflows for the protection of existing water rights and aquatic life;
13 (ii) the benefits to the applicant and the state;
14 (iii) the effects on the quantity and quality of water for existing uses in the source of supply;
15 (iv) the availability and feasibility of using low-quality water for the purpose for which application
16 has been made;
17 (v) the effects on private property rights by any creation of or contribution to saline seep; and
18 (vi) the probable significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposed use of water as
19 determined by the department pursuant to Title 75, chapter 1, or Title 75, chapter 20.
20 (5) The department may not approve a change in purpose of use or place of use for a diversion
21 that results in 4,000 or more acre-feet of water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water being
22 consumed unless:
23 (a) the applicant proves by clear and convincing evidence and the department finds that the
24 criteria in subsections (2) and (4) are met; and
25 (b) for the withdrawal and transportation of appropriated water for out-of-state use, the department
26 then petitions the legislature and the legislature affirms the decision of the department after one or more public
27 hearings.

1 (6) The state of Montana has long recognized the importance of conserving its public waters and
2 the necessity to maintain adequate water supplies for the state's water requirements, including requirements for
3 federal non-Indian and Indian reserved water rights held by the United States for federal reserved lands and in
4 trust for the various Indian tribes within the state's boundaries. Although the state of Montana also recognizes
5 that, under appropriate conditions, the out-of-state transportation and use of its public waters are not in conflict
6 with the public welfare of its citizens or the conservation of its waters, the following criteria must be met before
7 out-of-state use may occur:
8 (a) The department and, if applicable, the legislature may not approve a change in appropriation
9 right for the withdrawal and transportation of appropriated water for use outside the state unless the
10 appropriator proves by clear and convincing evidence and, if applicable, the legislature approves after one or
11 more public hearings that:

14 appropriation right subject to the provisions of this section in an existing water right, a permit, or a state water

16 is no presumption that an applicant for a change in appropriation right cannot establish lack of adverse effect
17 prior to the adjudication of other rights in the source of supply pursuant to this chapter. Except as provided in
18 85-2-410 and subsections (15) and (16) of this section [section 1], an appropriator may not make a change in

1 proves by a preponderance of evidence that the following criteria are met:
2 (a) The proposed change in appropriation right will not adversely affect the use of the existing
3 water rights of other persons or other perfected or planned uses or developments for which a permit or
4 certificate has been issued or for which a state water reservation has been issued under part 3. For purposes of
5 this section, adverse effects analysis is specific to the proposed change in appropriation right and a
6 determination that water is not legally available pursuant to 85-2-311 does not necessarily mean that an
7 adverse effect will occur.
8 (b) The proposed means of diversion, construction, and operation of the appropriation works are
9 adequate, except for:
10 (i) a change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-320 or 85-2-436;
11 (ii) a temporary change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-408; or
12 (iii) a change in appropriation right pursuant to 85-2-420 for mitigation or marketing for mitigation.

15 possessory interest, in the property where the water is to be put to beneficial use or, if the proposed change
16 involves a point of diversion, conveyance, or place of use on national forest system lands, the applicant has any
17 written special use authorization required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands
18 for the purpose of diversion, impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water.

22 (iii) a change in appropriation right pursuant to 85-2-420 for mitigation or marketing for mitigation.
23 (e) If the change in appropriation right involves salvaged water, the proposed water-saving
24 methods will salvage at least the amount of water asserted by the applicant.

6 the appropriator proves by a preponderance of evidence that:
7 (a) the criteria in subsection (2) are met; and
8 (b) the proposed change in appropriation right is a reasonable use. A finding of reasonable use
9 must be based on a consideration of:
10 (i) the existing legal demands of water rights on the state water supply, as well as projected legal
11 demands of water rights for future beneficial purposes, including municipal water supplies, irrigation systems,
12 and minimum streamflows for the protection of existing water rights and aquatic life;
13 (ii) the benefits to the applicant and the state;
14 (iii) the effects on the quantity and quality of water for existing uses in the source of supply;
15 (iv) the availability and feasibility of using low-quality water for the purpose for which application
16 has been made;
17 (v) the effects on private property rights by any creation of or contribution to saline seep; and
18 (vi) the probable significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposed use of water as
19 determined by the department pursuant to Title 75, chapter 1, or Title 75, chapter 20.
20 (5) The department may not approve a change in purpose of use or place of use for a diversion
21 that results in 4,000 or more acre-feet of water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water being

23 (a) the applicant proves by clear and convincing evidence and the department finds that the
24 criteria in subsections (2) and (4) are met; and
25 (b) for the withdrawal and transportation of appropriated water for out-of-state use, the department

1 (6) The state of Montana has long recognized the importance of conserving its public waters and
2 the necessity to maintain adequate water supplies for the state's water requirements, including requirements for
3 federal non-Indian and Indian reserved water rights held by the United States for federal reserved lands and in
4 trust for the various Indian tribes within the state's boundaries. Although the state of Montana also recognizes
5 that, under appropriate conditions, the out-of-state transportation and use of its public waters are not in conflict
6 with the public welfare of its citizens or the conservation of its waters, the following criteria must be met before
7 out-of-state use may occur:
8 (a) The department and, if applicable, the legislature may not approve a change in appropriation
9 right for the withdrawal and transportation of appropriated water for use outside the state unless the
10 appropriator proves by clear and convincing evidence and, if applicable, the legislature approves after one or
11 more public hearings that:
12 (i) depending on the volume of water diverted or consumed, the applicable criteria and
13 procedures of subsection (2) or (4) are met;
14 (ii) the proposed out-of-state use of water is not contrary to water conservation in Montana; and
15 (iii) the proposed out-of-state use of water is not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare of the
16 citizens of Montana.
17 (b) In determining whether the appropriator has proved by clear and convincing evidence that the
18 requirements of subsections (6)(a)(ii) and (6)(a)(iii) will be met, the department and, if applicable, the legislature
19 shall consider the following factors:
20 (i) whether there are present or projected water shortages within the state of Montana;
21 (ii) whether the water that is the subject of the proposed change in appropriation might feasibly be
22 transported to alleviate water shortages within the state of Montana;
23 (iii) the supply and sources of water available to the applicant in the state where the applicant
24 intends to use the water; and
25 (iv) the existing legal demands of water rights placed on the applicant's supply in the state where
26 the applicant intends to use the water.

1 outside the state, the applicant shall submit to and comply with the laws of the state of Montana governing the
2 appropriation and use of water.
3 (7) For any application for a change in appropriation right involving 4,000 or more acre-feet of
4 water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water, the department shall give notice of the proposed
5 change in appropriation right in accordance with 85-2-307 and shall hold one or more hearings in accordance
6 with 85-2-309 prior to its approval or denial of the proposed change in appropriation right. The department shall
7 provide notice and may hold one or more hearings upon any other proposed change in appropriation right if it
8 determines that the proposed change in appropriation right might adversely affect the rights of other persons.
9 (8) The department or the legislature, if applicable, may approve a change in appropriation right
10 subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations that it considers necessary to satisfy the criteria of
11 this section, including limitations on the time for completion of the change in appropriation right. The department
12 may extend time limits specified in the change in appropriation right approval under the applicable criteria and
13 procedures of 85-2-312.
14 (9) Upon actual application of water to the proposed beneficial use within the time allowed, the
15 appropriator shall notify the department that the appropriation has been completed. The notification must
16 contain a certified statement by a person with experience in the design, construction, or operation of
17 appropriation works describing how the appropriation was completed.
18 (10) If a change in appropriation right is not completed as approved by the department or legislature
19 or if the terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations of the change in appropriation right approval are not
20 complied with, the department may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, require the appropriator to show
21 cause why the change in appropriation right approval should not be modified or revoked. If the appropriator fails
22 to show sufficient cause, the department may modify or revoke the change in appropriation right approval.
23 (11) The original of a change in appropriation right approval issued by the department must be sent
24 to the applicant, and a duplicate must be kept in the office of the department in Helena.
25 (12) A person holding an issued permit or change in appropriation right approval that has not been
26 perfected may change the place of diversion, place of use, purpose of use, or place of storage by filing an
27 application for change in appropriation right pursuant to this section.

1 (e) (i) An appropriator may file a correct and complete objection with the department alleging that
2 the change in appropriation right for a replacement point of diversion will adversely affect the use of the existing
3 water rights of other persons or other perfected or planned uses or developments for which a permit or
4 certificate has been issued or for which a state water reservation has been issued under Title 85, chapter 2,
5 part 3.
6 (ii) If the department determines after a contested case hearing between the appropriator and the
7 objector that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely affected, it may revoke the change
8 or make the change subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations necessary to protect the rights of
9 other appropriators.
10 (iii) The burden of proof to prove lack of adverse effect at the hearing is on the appropriator

14 "85-2-407. Temporary changes in appropriation right. (1) Except as provided in 85-2-410, an
15 appropriator may not make a temporary change in appropriation right for the appropriator's use or another's use
16 except with department approval in accordance with 85-2-402, [section 1], and this section.
17 (2) Except as provided in subsection (9), a temporary change in appropriation right may be
18 approved for a period not to exceed 10 years. A temporary change in appropriation right may be approved for
19 consecutive or intermittent use.
20 (3) An authorization for a temporary change in appropriation right may be renewed by the
21 department for a period not to exceed 10 years. There is no limitation on the number of renewals the
22 appropriator may seek. Renewal of an authorization for a temporary change in appropriation right requires
23 notice to the department by the appropriator. Upon receipt of the notice, the department shall notify other
24 appropriators potentially affected by the renewal and shall allow 90 days for submission of new evidence of
25 adverse effects to other water rights. A temporary change authorization may not be renewed by the department
26 if it determines that the right of an appropriator, other than an appropriator described in subsection (7), is

1 (4) (a) During the term of the original temporary change authorization, the department may modify
2 or revoke its authorization for a temporary change if it determines that the right of an appropriator, other than an
3 appropriator described in subsection (7), is adversely affected.
4 (b) An appropriator, other than an appropriator identified in subsection (7), may object:
5 (i) during the initial temporary change application process;
6 (ii) during the temporary change renewal process; and
7 (iii) once during the term of the temporary change permit.
8 (5) The priority of appropriation for a temporary change in appropriation right is the same as the
9 priority of appropriation of the right that is temporarily changed.
10 (6) Neither a change in appropriation right nor any other authorization right is required for reversion
11 of the appropriation right to the permanent purpose, place of use, point of diversion, or place of storage after
12 the period for which a temporary change was authorized expires.
13 (7) A person issued a water use permit with a priority of appropriation after the date of filing of an
14 application for a temporary change in appropriation right under this section may not object to the exercise of the
15 temporary change according to its terms, the renewal of the authorization for the temporary change, or the
16 reversion of the appropriation right to its permanent purpose, place of use, point of diversion, or place of
17 storage. Persons described in this subsection must be notified of the existence of any temporary change
18 authorizations from the same source of supply.
19 (8) If a water right for which a temporary change in appropriation right has been approved is
20 transferred as an appurtenance of real property, the temporary change remains in effect unless another change
21 in appropriation right is authorized by the department.
22 (9) If the quantity of water that is subject to a temporary change in appropriation right is made
23 available from the development of a new water conservation or storage project, a temporary change in
24 appropriation right may be approved for a period not to exceed 30 years unless a renewal is obtained pursuant
25 to subsection (3)."
