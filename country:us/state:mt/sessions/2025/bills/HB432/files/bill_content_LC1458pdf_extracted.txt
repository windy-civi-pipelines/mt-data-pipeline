3 Section 4. Section 85-2-402, MCA, is amended to read:
4 "85-2-402. Changes in appropriation rights -- definition. (1) (a) The right to make a change in
5 appropriation right subject to the provisions of this section in an existing water right, a permit, or a state water
6 reservation is recognized and confirmed. In a change in appropriation right proceeding under this section, there
7 is no presumption that an applicant for a change in appropriation right cannot establish lack of adverse effect
8 prior to the adjudication of other rights in the source of supply pursuant to this chapter. Except as provided in
9 85-2-410 and subsections (15) and (16) of this section [section 1], an appropriator may not make a change in
10 an appropriation right without the approval of the department or, if applicable, of the legislature. An applicant
11 shall submit a correct and complete application.
12 (b) If an application involves a change in a point of diversion, conveyance, or place of use located
13 on national forest system lands, the application is not correct and complete until the applicant has submitted
14 proof to the department of any written special use authorization required by federal law for the proposed
15 change in occupancy, use, or traverse of national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
16 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water.
17 (2) Except as provided in subsections (4) through (6), (15), (16), and (18) and, if applicable,
18 subject to subsection (17) (15), the department shall approve a change in appropriation right if the appropriator
19 proves by a preponderance of evidence that the following criteria are met:
20 (a) The proposed change in appropriation right will not adversely affect the use of the existing
21 water rights of other persons or other perfected or planned uses or developments for which a permit or
22 certificate has been issued or for which a state water reservation has been issued under part 3. For purposes of
23 this section, adverse effects analysis is specific to the proposed change in appropriation right and a
24 determination that water is not legally available pursuant to 85-2-311 does not necessarily mean that an
25 adverse effect will occur.
26 (b) The proposed means of diversion, construction, and operation of the appropriation works are
27 adequate, except for:
28 (i) a change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-320 or 85-2-436;
- 9 - LC 1458
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1458
1 (ii) a temporary change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-408; or
2 (iii) a change in appropriation right pursuant to 85-2-420 for mitigation or marketing for mitigation.
3 (c) The proposed use of water is a beneficial use.
4 (d) The applicant has a possessory interest, or the written consent of the person with the
5 possessory interest, in the property where the water is to be put to beneficial use or, if the proposed change
6 involves a point of diversion, conveyance, or place of use on national forest system lands, the applicant has any
7 written special use authorization required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands
8 for the purpose of diversion, impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water.
9 This subsection (2)(d) does not apply to:
10 (i) a change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-320 or 85-2-436;
11 (ii) a temporary change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-408; or
12 (iii) a change in appropriation right pursuant to 85-2-420 for mitigation or marketing for mitigation.
13 (e) If the change in appropriation right involves salvaged water, the proposed water-saving
14 methods will salvage at least the amount of water asserted by the applicant.
15 (f) The water quality of an appropriator will not be adversely affected.
16 (g) The ability of a discharge permitholder to satisfy effluent limitations of a permit issued in
17 accordance with Title 75, chapter 5, part 4, will not be adversely affected.
18 (3) The applicant is required to prove that the criteria in subsections (2)(f) and (2)(g) have been
19 met only if a valid objection is filed. A valid objection must contain substantial credible information establishing
20 to the satisfaction of the department that the criteria in subsection (2)(f) or (2)(g), as applicable, may not be met.
21 (4) The department may not approve a change in purpose of use or place of use of an
22 appropriation of 4,000 or more acre-feet of water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water unless
23 the appropriator proves by a preponderance of evidence that:
24 (a) the criteria in subsection (2) are met; and
25 (b) the proposed change in appropriation right is a reasonable use. A finding of reasonable use
26 must be based on a consideration of:
27 (i) the existing legal demands of water rights on the state water supply, as well as projected legal
28 demands of water rights for future beneficial purposes, including municipal water supplies, irrigation systems,
- 10 - LC 1458
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1458
1 and minimum streamflows for the protection of existing water rights and aquatic life;
2 (ii) the benefits to the applicant and the state;
3 (iii) the effects on the quantity and quality of water for existing uses in the source of supply;
4 (iv) the availability and feasibility of using low-quality water for the purpose for which application
5 has been made;
6 (v) the effects on private property rights by any creation of or contribution to saline seep; and
7 (vi) the probable significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposed use of water as
8 determined by the department pursuant to Title 75, chapter 1, or Title 75, chapter 20.
9 (5) The department may not approve a change in purpose of use or place of use for a diversion
10 that results in 4,000 or more acre-feet of water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water being
11 consumed unless:
12 (a) the applicant proves by clear and convincing evidence and the department finds that the
13 criteria in subsections (2) and (4) are met; and
14 (b) for the withdrawal and transportation of appropriated water for out-of-state use, the department
15 then petitions the legislature and the legislature affirms the decision of the department after one or more public
16 hearings.
17 (6) The state of Montana has long recognized the importance of conserving its public waters and
18 the necessity to maintain adequate water supplies for the state's water requirements, including requirements for
19 federal non-Indian and Indian reserved water rights held by the United States for federal reserved lands and in
20 trust for the various Indian tribes within the state's boundaries. Although the state of Montana also recognizes
21 that, under appropriate conditions, the out-of-state transportation and use of its public waters are not in conflict
22 with the public welfare of its citizens or the conservation of its waters, the following criteria must be met before
23 out-of-state use may occur:
24 (a) The department and, if applicable, the legislature may not approve a change in appropriation
25 right for the withdrawal and transportation of appropriated water for use outside the state unless the
26 appropriator proves by clear and convincing evidence and, if applicable, the legislature approves after one or
27 more public hearings that:
28 (i) depending on the volume of water diverted or consumed, the applicable criteria and
- 11 - LC 1458
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1458
1 procedures of subsection (2) or (4) are met;
2 (ii) the proposed out-of-state use of water is not contrary to water conservation in Montana; and
3 (iii) the proposed out-of-state use of water is not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare of the
4 citizens of Montana.
5 (b) In determining whether the appropriator has proved by clear and convincing evidence that the
6 requirements of subsections (6)(a)(ii) and (6)(a)(iii) will be met, the department and, if applicable, the legislature
7 shall consider the following factors:
8 (i) whether there are present or projected water shortages within the state of Montana;
9 (ii) whether the water that is the subject of the proposed change in appropriation might feasibly be
10 transported to alleviate water shortages within the state of Montana;
11 (iii) the supply and sources of water available to the applicant in the state where the applicant
12 intends to use the water; and
13 (iv) the existing legal demands of water rights placed on the applicant's supply in the state where
14 the applicant intends to use the water.
15 (c) When applying for a change in appropriation right to withdraw and transport water for use
16 outside the state, the applicant shall submit to and comply with the laws of the state of Montana governing the
17 appropriation and use of water.
18 (7) For any application for a change in appropriation right involving 4,000 or more acre-feet of
19 water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water, the department shall give notice of the proposed
20 change in appropriation right in accordance with 85-2-307 and shall hold one or more hearings in accordance
21 with 85-2-309 prior to its approval or denial of the proposed change in appropriation right. The department shall
22 provide notice and may hold one or more hearings upon any other proposed change in appropriation right if it
23 determines that the proposed change in appropriation right might adversely affect the rights of other persons.
24 (8) The department or the legislature, if applicable, may approve a change in appropriation right
25 subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations that it considers necessary to satisfy the criteria of
26 this section, including limitations on the time for completion of the change in appropriation right. The department
27 may extend time limits specified in the change in appropriation right approval under the applicable criteria and
28 procedures of 85-2-312.

3 Section 4. Section 85-2-402, MCA, is amended to read:
4 "85-2-402. Changes in appropriation rights -- definition. (1) (a) The right to make a change in
5 appropriation right subject to the provisions of this section in an existing water right, a permit, or a state water
6 reservation is recognized and confirmed. In a change in appropriation right proceeding under this section, there
7 is no presumption that an applicant for a change in appropriation right cannot establish lack of adverse effect
8 prior to the adjudication of other rights in the source of supply pursuant to this chapter. Except as provided in
9 85-2-410 and subsections (15) and (16) of this section [section 1], an appropriator may not make a change in
10 an appropriation right without the approval of the department or, if applicable, of the legislature. An applicant
11 shall submit a correct and complete application.
12 (b) If an application involves a change in a point of diversion, conveyance, or place of use located
13 on national forest system lands, the application is not correct and complete until the applicant has submitted
14 proof to the department of any written special use authorization required by federal law for the proposed
15 change in occupancy, use, or traverse of national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
16 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water.
17 (2) Except as provided in subsections (4) through (6), (15), (16), and (18) and, if applicable,
18 subject to subsection (17) (15), the department shall approve a change in appropriation right if the appropriator
19 proves by a preponderance of evidence that the following criteria are met:
20 (a) The proposed change in appropriation right will not adversely affect the use of the existing
21 water rights of other persons or other perfected or planned uses or developments for which a permit or
22 certificate has been issued or for which a state water reservation has been issued under part 3. For purposes of
23 this section, adverse effects analysis is specific to the proposed change in appropriation right and a
24 determination that water is not legally available pursuant to 85-2-311 does not necessarily mean that an
25 adverse effect will occur.
26 (b) The proposed means of diversion, construction, and operation of the appropriation works are
27 adequate, except for:
28 (i) a change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-320 or 85-2-436;
- 9 - LC 1458

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1458
1 (ii) a temporary change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-408; or
2 (iii) a change in appropriation right pursuant to 85-2-420 for mitigation or marketing for mitigation.
3 (c) The proposed use of water is a beneficial use.
4 (d) The applicant has a possessory interest, or the written consent of the person with the
5 possessory interest, in the property where the water is to be put to beneficial use or, if the proposed change
6 involves a point of diversion, conveyance, or place of use on national forest system lands, the applicant has any
7 written special use authorization required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands
8 for the purpose of diversion, impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water.
9 This subsection (2)(d) does not apply to:
10 (i) a change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-320 or 85-2-436;
11 (ii) a temporary change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-408; or
12 (iii) a change in appropriation right pursuant to 85-2-420 for mitigation or marketing for mitigation.
13 (e) If the change in appropriation right involves salvaged water, the proposed water-saving
14 methods will salvage at least the amount of water asserted by the applicant.
15 (f) The water quality of an appropriator will not be adversely affected.
16 (g) The ability of a discharge permitholder to satisfy effluent limitations of a permit issued in
17 accordance with Title 75, chapter 5, part 4, will not be adversely affected.
18 (3) The applicant is required to prove that the criteria in subsections (2)(f) and (2)(g) have been
19 met only if a valid objection is filed. A valid objection must contain substantial credible information establishing
20 to the satisfaction of the department that the criteria in subsection (2)(f) or (2)(g), as applicable, may not be met.
21 (4) The department may not approve a change in purpose of use or place of use of an
22 appropriation of 4,000 or more acre-feet of water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water unless
23 the appropriator proves by a preponderance of evidence that:
24 (a) the criteria in subsection (2) are met; and
25 (b) the proposed change in appropriation right is a reasonable use. A finding of reasonable use
26 must be based on a consideration of:
27 (i) the existing legal demands of water rights on the state water supply, as well as projected legal
28 demands of water rights for future beneficial purposes, including municipal water supplies, irrigation systems,
- 10 - LC 1458

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1458
1 and minimum streamflows for the protection of existing water rights and aquatic life;
2 (ii) the benefits to the applicant and the state;
3 (iii) the effects on the quantity and quality of water for existing uses in the source of supply;
4 (iv) the availability and feasibility of using low-quality water for the purpose for which application
5 has been made;
6 (v) the effects on private property rights by any creation of or contribution to saline seep; and
7 (vi) the probable significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposed use of water as
8 determined by the department pursuant to Title 75, chapter 1, or Title 75, chapter 20.
9 (5) The department may not approve a change in purpose of use or place of use for a diversion
10 that results in 4,000 or more acre-feet of water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water being
11 consumed unless:
12 (a) the applicant proves by clear and convincing evidence and the department finds that the
13 criteria in subsections (2) and (4) are met; and
14 (b) for the withdrawal and transportation of appropriated water for out-of-state use, the department
15 then petitions the legislature and the legislature affirms the decision of the department after one or more public
16 hearings.
17 (6) The state of Montana has long recognized the importance of conserving its public waters and
18 the necessity to maintain adequate water supplies for the state's water requirements, including requirements for
19 federal non-Indian and Indian reserved water rights held by the United States for federal reserved lands and in
20 trust for the various Indian tribes within the state's boundaries. Although the state of Montana also recognizes
21 that, under appropriate conditions, the out-of-state transportation and use of its public waters are not in conflict
22 with the public welfare of its citizens or the conservation of its waters, the following criteria must be met before
23 out-of-state use may occur:
24 (a) The department and, if applicable, the legislature may not approve a change in appropriation
25 right for the withdrawal and transportation of appropriated water for use outside the state unless the
26 appropriator proves by clear and convincing evidence and, if applicable, the legislature approves after one or
27 more public hearings that:
28 (i) depending on the volume of water diverted or consumed, the applicable criteria and
- 11 - LC 1458

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1458
1 procedures of subsection (2) or (4) are met;
2 (ii) the proposed out-of-state use of water is not contrary to water conservation in Montana; and
3 (iii) the proposed out-of-state use of water is not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare of the
4 citizens of Montana.
5 (b) In determining whether the appropriator has proved by clear and convincing evidence that the
6 requirements of subsections (6)(a)(ii) and (6)(a)(iii) will be met, the department and, if applicable, the legislature
7 shall consider the following factors:
8 (i) whether there are present or projected water shortages within the state of Montana;
9 (ii) whether the water that is the subject of the proposed change in appropriation might feasibly be
10 transported to alleviate water shortages within the state of Montana;
11 (iii) the supply and sources of water available to the applicant in the state where the applicant
12 intends to use the water; and
13 (iv) the existing legal demands of water rights placed on the applicant's supply in the state where
14 the applicant intends to use the water.
15 (c) When applying for a change in appropriation right to withdraw and transport water for use
16 outside the state, the applicant shall submit to and comply with the laws of the state of Montana governing the
17 appropriation and use of water.
18 (7) For any application for a change in appropriation right involving 4,000 or more acre-feet of
19 water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water, the department shall give notice of the proposed
20 change in appropriation right in accordance with 85-2-307 and shall hold one or more hearings in accordance
21 with 85-2-309 prior to its approval or denial of the proposed change in appropriation right. The department shall
22 provide notice and may hold one or more hearings upon any other proposed change in appropriation right if it
23 determines that the proposed change in appropriation right might adversely affect the rights of other persons.
24 (8) The department or the legislature, if applicable, may approve a change in appropriation right
25 subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations that it considers necessary to satisfy the criteria of
26 this section, including limitations on the time for completion of the change in appropriation right. The department
27 may extend time limits specified in the change in appropriation right approval under the applicable criteria and
28 procedures of 85-2-312.

69th Legislature 2025 LC 1458
1 (9) Upon actual application of water to the proposed beneficial use within the time allowed, the
2 appropriator shall notify the department that the appropriation has been completed. The notification must
3 contain a certified statement by a person with experience in the design, construction, or operation of
4 appropriation works describing how the appropriation was completed.
5 (10) If a change in appropriation right is not completed as approved by the department or legislature
6 or if the terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations of the change in appropriation right approval are not
7 complied with, the department may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, require the appropriator to show
8 cause why the change in appropriation right approval should not be modified or revoked. If the appropriator fails
9 to show sufficient cause, the department may modify or revoke the change in appropriation right approval.
10 (11) The original of a change in appropriation right approval issued by the department must be sent
11 to the applicant, and a duplicate must be kept in the office of the department in Helena.
12 (12) A person holding an issued permit or change in appropriation right approval that has not been
13 perfected may change the place of diversion, place of use, purpose of use, or place of storage by filing an
14 application for change in appropriation right pursuant to this section.
15 (13) A change in appropriation right contrary to the provisions of this section is invalid. An officer,
16 agent, agency, or employee of the state may not knowingly permit, aid, or assist in any manner an unauthorized
17 change in appropriation right. A person or corporation may not, directly or indirectly, personally or through an
18 agent, officer, or employee, attempt to change an appropriation right except in accordance with this section.
19 (14) The department may adopt rules to implement the provisions of this section.

23 Section 5. Section 85-2-407, MCA, is amended to read:
24 "85-2-407. Temporary changes in appropriation right. (1) Except as provided in 85-2-410, an
25 appropriator may not make a temporary change in appropriation right for the appropriator's use or another's use
26 except with department approval in accordance with 85-2-402, [section 1], and this section.
27 (2) Except as provided in subsection (9), a temporary change in appropriation right may be

69th Legislature 2025 LC 1458
1 consecutive or intermittent use.
2 (3) An authorization for a temporary change in appropriation right may be renewed by the
3 department for a period not to exceed 10 years. There is no limitation on the number of renewals the
4 appropriator may seek. Renewal of an authorization for a temporary change in appropriation right requires
5 notice to the department by the appropriator. Upon receipt of the notice, the department shall notify other
6 appropriators potentially affected by the renewal and shall allow 90 days for submission of new evidence of
7 adverse effects to other water rights. A temporary change authorization may not be renewed by the department
8 if it determines that the right of an appropriator, other than an appropriator described in subsection (7), is
9 adversely affected.
10 (4) (a) During the term of the original temporary change authorization, the department may modify
11 or revoke its authorization for a temporary change if it determines that the right of an appropriator, other than an
12 appropriator described in subsection (7), is adversely affected.
13 (b) An appropriator, other than an appropriator identified in subsection (7), may object:
14 (i) during the initial temporary change application process;
15 (ii) during the temporary change renewal process; and
16 (iii) once during the term of the temporary change permit.
17 (5) The priority of appropriation for a temporary change in appropriation right is the same as the
18 priority of appropriation of the right that is temporarily changed.
19 (6) Neither a change in appropriation right nor any other authorization right is required for reversion
20 of the appropriation right to the permanent purpose, place of use, point of diversion, or place of storage after
21 the period for which a temporary change was authorized expires.
22 (7) A person issued a water use permit with a priority of appropriation after the date of filing of an
23 application for a temporary change in appropriation right under this section may not object to the exercise of the
24 temporary change according to its terms, the renewal of the authorization for the temporary change, or the
25 reversion of the appropriation right to its permanent purpose, place of use, point of diversion, or place of
26 storage. Persons described in this subsection must be notified of the existence of any temporary change
27 authorizations from the same source of supply.
28 (8) If a water right for which a temporary change in appropriation right has been approved is
- 18 - LC 1458

69th Legislature 2025 LC 1458
1 transferred as an appurtenance of real property, the temporary change remains in effect unless another change
2 in appropriation right is authorized by the department.
3 (9) If the quantity of water that is subject to a temporary change in appropriation right is made
4 available from the development of a new water conservation or storage project, a temporary change in
5 appropriation right may be approved for a period not to exceed 30 years unless a renewal is obtained pursuant
6 to subsection (3)."
