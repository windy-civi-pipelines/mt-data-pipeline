Section 4. Section 85-2-402, MCA, is amended to read:
"85-2-402. Changes in appropriation rights -- definition. (1) (a) The right to make a change in
appropriation right subject to the provisions of this section in an existing water right, a permit, or a state water
reservation is recognized and confirmed. In a change in appropriation right proceeding under this section, there
is no presumption that an applicant for a change in appropriation right cannot establish lack of adverse effect
prior to the adjudication of other rights in the source of supply pursuant to this chapter. Except as provided in
85-2-410 and subsections (15) and (16) of this section [section 1], an appropriator may not make a change in
an appropriation right without the approval of the department or, if applicable, of the legislature. An applicant
shall submit a correct and complete application.
(b) If an application involves a change in a point of diversion, conveyance, or place of use located
on national forest system lands, the application is not correct and complete until the applicant has submitted
proof to the department of any written special use authorization required by federal law for the proposed
change in occupancy, use, or traverse of national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water.
(2) Except as provided in subsections (4) through (6), (15), (16), and (18) and, if applicable,
subject to subsection (17) (15), the department shall approve a change in appropriation right if the appropriator
proves by a preponderance of evidence that the following criteria are met:
(a) The proposed change in appropriation right will not adversely affect the use of the existing
water rights of other persons or other perfected or planned uses or developments for which a permit or
certificate has been issued or for which a state water reservation has been issued under part 3. For purposes of
this section, adverse effects analysis is specific to the proposed change in appropriation right and a
determination that water is not legally available pursuant to 85-2-311 does not necessarily mean that an
adverse effect will occur.
(b) The proposed means of diversion, construction, and operation of the appropriation works are
adequate, except for:
(i) a change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-320 or 85-2-436;
(ii) a temporary change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-408; or
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 432
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 432
(iii) a change in appropriation right pursuant to 85-2-420 for mitigation or marketing for mitigation.
(c) The proposed use of water is a beneficial use.
(d) The applicant has a possessory interest, or the written consent of the person with the
possessory interest, in the property where the water is to be put to beneficial use or, if the proposed change
involves a point of diversion, conveyance, or place of use on national forest system lands, the applicant has any
written special use authorization required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands
for the purpose of diversion, impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water.
This subsection (2)(d) does not apply to:
(i) a change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-320 or 85-2-436;
(ii) a temporary change in appropriation right for instream flow pursuant to 85-2-408; or
(iii) a change in appropriation right pursuant to 85-2-420 for mitigation or marketing for mitigation.
(e) If the change in appropriation right involves salvaged water, the proposed water-saving
methods will salvage at least the amount of water asserted by the applicant.
(f) The water quality of an appropriator will not be adversely affected.
(g) The ability of a discharge permitholder to satisfy effluent limitations of a permit issued in
accordance with Title 75, chapter 5, part 4, will not be adversely affected.
(3) The applicant is required to prove that the criteria in subsections (2)(f) and (2)(g) have been
met only if a valid objection is filed. A valid objection must contain substantial credible information establishing
to the satisfaction of the department that the criteria in subsection (2)(f) or (2)(g), as applicable, may not be met.
(4) The department may not approve a change in purpose of use or place of use of an
appropriation of 4,000 or more acre-feet of water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water unless
the appropriator proves by a preponderance of evidence that:
(a) the criteria in subsection (2) are met; and
(b) the proposed change in appropriation right is a reasonable use. A finding of reasonable use
must be based on a consideration of:
(i) the existing legal demands of water rights on the state water supply, as well as projected legal
demands of water rights for future beneficial purposes, including municipal water supplies, irrigation systems,
and minimum streamflows for the protection of existing water rights and aquatic life;
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 432
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 432
(ii) the benefits to the applicant and the state;
(iii) the effects on the quantity and quality of water for existing uses in the source of supply;
(iv) the availability and feasibility of using low-quality water for the purpose for which application
has been made;
(v) the effects on private property rights by any creation of or contribution to saline seep; and
(vi) the probable significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposed use of water as
determined by the department pursuant to Title 75, chapter 1, or Title 75, chapter 20.
(5) The department may not approve a change in purpose of use or place of use for a diversion
that results in 4,000 or more acre-feet of water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water being
consumed unless:
(a) the applicant proves by clear and convincing evidence and the department finds that the
criteria in subsections (2) and (4) are met; and
(b) for the withdrawal and transportation of appropriated water for out-of-state use, the department
then petitions the legislature and the legislature affirms the decision of the department after one or more public
hearings.
(6) The state of Montana has long recognized the importance of conserving its public waters and
the necessity to maintain adequate water supplies for the state's water requirements, including requirements for
federal non-Indian and Indian reserved water rights held by the United States for federal reserved lands and in
trust for the various Indian tribes within the state's boundaries. Although the state of Montana also recognizes
that, under appropriate conditions, the out-of-state transportation and use of its public waters are not in conflict
with the public welfare of its citizens or the conservation of its waters, the following criteria must be met before
out-of-state use may occur:
(a) The department and, if applicable, the legislature may not approve a change in appropriation
right for the withdrawal and transportation of appropriated water for use outside the state unless the
appropriator proves by clear and convincing evidence and, if applicable, the legislature approves after one or
more public hearings that:
(i) depending on the volume of water diverted or consumed, the applicable criteria and
procedures of subsection (2) or (4) are met;
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – HB 432
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 432
(ii) the proposed out-of-state use of water is not contrary to water conservation in Montana; and
(iii) the proposed out-of-state use of water is not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare of the
citizens of Montana.
(b) In determining whether the appropriator has proved by clear and convincing evidence that the
requirements of subsections (6)(a)(ii) and (6)(a)(iii) will be met, the department and, if applicable, the legislature
shall consider the following factors:
(i) whether there are present or projected water shortages within the state of Montana;
(ii) whether the water that is the subject of the proposed change in appropriation might feasibly be
transported to alleviate water shortages within the state of Montana;
(iii) the supply and sources of water available to the applicant in the state where the applicant
intends to use the water; and
(iv) the existing legal demands of water rights placed on the applicant's supply in the state where
the applicant intends to use the water.
(c) When applying for a change in appropriation right to withdraw and transport water for use
outside the state, the applicant shall submit to and comply with the laws of the state of Montana governing the
appropriation and use of water.
(7) For any application for a change in appropriation right involving 4,000 or more acre-feet of
water a year and 5.5 or more cubic feet per second of water, the department shall give notice of the proposed
change in appropriation right in accordance with 85-2-307 and shall hold one or more hearings in accordance
with 85-2-309 prior to its approval or denial of the proposed change in appropriation right. The department shall
provide notice and may hold one or more hearings upon any other proposed change in appropriation right if it
determines that the proposed change in appropriation right might adversely affect the rights of other persons.
(8) The department or the legislature, if applicable, may approve a change in appropriation right
subject to the terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations that it considers necessary to satisfy the criteria of
this section, including limitations on the time for completion of the change in appropriation right. The department
may extend time limits specified in the change in appropriation right approval under the applicable criteria and
procedures of 85-2-312.
(9) Upon actual application of water to the proposed beneficial use within the time allowed, the
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – HB 432
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 432
appropriator shall notify the department that the appropriation has been completed. The notification must
contain a certified statement by a person with experience in the design, construction, or operation of
appropriation works describing how the appropriation was completed.
(10) If a change in appropriation right is not completed as approved by the department or legislature
or if the terms, conditions, restrictions, and limitations of the change in appropriation right approval are not
complied with, the department may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, require the appropriator to show
cause why the change in appropriation right approval should not be modified or revoked. If the appropriator fails
to show sufficient cause, the department may modify or revoke the change in appropriation right approval.
(11) The original of a change in appropriation right approval issued by the department must be sent
to the applicant, and a duplicate must be kept in the office of the department in Helena.
(12) A person holding an issued permit or change in appropriation right approval that has not been
perfected may change the place of diversion, place of use, purpose of use, or place of storage by filing an
application for change in appropriation right pursuant to this section.
(13) A change in appropriation right contrary to the provisions of this section is invalid. An officer,
agent, agency, or employee of the state may not knowingly permit, aid, or assist in any manner an unauthorized
change in appropriation right. A person or corporation may not, directly or indirectly, personally or through an
agent, officer, or employee, attempt to change an appropriation right except in accordance with this section.
(14) The department may adopt rules to implement the provisions of this section.
(15) (a) An appropriator may change an appropriation right for a replacement well without the prior
approval of the department if:
(i) the appropriation right is for:
(A) ground water outside the boundaries of a controlled ground water area; or
(B) ground water inside the boundaries of a controlled ground water area and if the provisions of
the rule establishing the controlled ground water area do not restrict a change in appropriation right;
(ii) the change in appropriation right is to replace an existing well and the existing well will no
longer be used;
(iii) the rate and volume of the appropriation from the replacement well are equal to or less than
that of the well being replaced and do not exceed:

part 3.
(ii) If the department determines after a contested case hearing between the appropriator and the

(3) An authorization for a temporary change in appropriation right may be renewed by the
department for a period not to exceed 10 years. There is no limitation on the number of renewals the

notice to the department by the appropriator. Upon receipt of the notice, the department shall notify other
appropriators potentially affected by the renewal and shall allow 90 days for submission of new evidence of
adverse effects to other water rights. A temporary change authorization may not be renewed by the department
if it determines that the right of an appropriator, other than an appropriator described in subsection (7), is
adversely affected.
(4) (a) During the term of the original temporary change authorization, the department may modify
or revoke its authorization for a temporary change if it determines that the right of an appropriator, other than an

(i) during the initial temporary change application process;
(ii) during the temporary change renewal process; and
(iii) once during the term of the temporary change permit.
(5) The priority of appropriation for a temporary change in appropriation right is the same as the
priority of appropriation of the right that is temporarily changed.
(6) Neither a change in appropriation right nor any other authorization right is required for reversion
of the appropriation right to the permanent purpose, place of use, point of diversion, or place of storage after
the period for which a temporary change was authorized expires.
(7) A person issued a water use permit with a priority of appropriation after the date of filing of an
application for a temporary change in appropriation right under this section may not object to the exercise of the
temporary change according to its terms, the renewal of the authorization for the temporary change, or the
reversion of the appropriation right to its permanent purpose, place of use, point of diversion, or place of
storage. Persons described in this subsection must be notified of the existence of any temporary change
authorizations from the same source of supply.
(8) If a water right for which a temporary change in appropriation right has been approved is
transferred as an appurtenance of real property, the temporary change remains in effect unless another change
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – HB 432

in appropriation right is authorized by the department.
(9) If the quantity of water that is subject to a temporary change in appropriation right is made
available from the development of a new water conservation or storage project, a temporary change in
appropriation right may be approved for a period not to exceed 30 years unless a renewal is obtained pursuant
to subsection (3)."
