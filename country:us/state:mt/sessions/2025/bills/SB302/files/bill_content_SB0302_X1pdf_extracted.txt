69th Legislature 2025 SB 302
connection with its proceedings.
(b) The Montana board may, in its discretion, determine the appeal on the record if all parties
receive a copy of the transcript and are permitted to submit additional sworn statements, or the Montana board
may hear further testimony.
(c) For industrial property that is assessed annually by the department, the Montana board's
review must be de novo and conducted in accordance with the contested case provisions of the Montana
Administrative Procedure Act.
(d) For the purpose of expediting its work, the Montana board may refer any appeal to one of its

powers of the Montana board in conducting a hearing and shall, as soon as possible after the hearing, report
the proceedings, together with a transcript or a tape recording of the hearing, to the Montana board. The
Montana board shall determine the appeal on the record.
(3) (a) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b), the Montana tax appeal board shall consider an
independent appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of
real estate appraisers and the appraisal was conducted within 6 months of the valuation date. If the Montana
board does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the Montana board shall
provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal.
(b) If the appeal is an appeal of the valuation of residential property, the Montana board shall
consider an independent appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the
Montana board of real estate appraisers and uses values obtained within the timeframe provided for in
subsection (3)(a). The appraisal that is provided by the taxpayer is presumed to establish assessed value in the
Montana board proceeding unless the department provides sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of
correctness, including another independent appraisal or other compelling valuation evidence. The Montana
board shall address the taxpayer's independent appraisal and the department's valuation evidence in the
decision.

rules of discovery and may affirm, reverse, or modify any decision. To the extent that this section is in conflict
with the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, this section supersedes that act. The Montana board may not
amend or repeal any administrative rule of the department. The Montana board shall give an administrative rule
full effect unless the Montana board finds a rule arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise unlawful.
(6) The decision of the Montana board is final and binding on all interested parties and not subject
to a rehearing unless reversed or modified by judicial review. Proceedings for judicial review of a decision of the
Montana board under this section are subject to the provisions of 15-2-303 and the Montana Administrative
Procedure Act to the extent that it does not conflict with 15-2-303.
(7) Sections 15-6-134 and 15-7-111 may not be construed to prevent the department from
implementing an order to change the valuation of property.
(8) If the appeal involves class four residential property, a person satisfying the requirements in
subsection (1)(b) may make an election to have the Montana board consider the appeal on an informal basis. If
an informal review is elected, the decision of the Montana board is final and binding on all parties, including the
department, and is not subject to reconsideration or an appeal to district court by the taxpayer or the
department. The Montana board shall adopt rules outlining informal review procedures pursuant to this
subsection."
