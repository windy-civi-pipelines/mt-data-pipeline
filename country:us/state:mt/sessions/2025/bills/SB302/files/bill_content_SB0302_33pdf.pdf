1 (b) The Montana board may, in its discretion, determine the appeal on the record if all parties
2 receive a copy of the transcript and are permitted to submit additional sworn statements, or the Montana board
3 may hear further testimony.
4 (c) For industrial property that is assessed annually by the department, the Montana board's
5 review must be de novo and conducted in accordance with the contested case provisions of the Montana
6 Administrative Procedure Act.
7 (d) For the purpose of expediting its work, the Montana board may refer any appeal to one of its
8 members or to a designated hearings officer. The board member or hearings officer may exercise all the
9 powers of the Montana board in conducting a hearing and shall, as soon as possible after the hearing, report
10 the proceedings, together with a transcript or a tape recording of the hearing, to the Montana board. The
11 Montana board shall determine the appeal on the record.
12 (3) (a) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b), the Montana tax appeal board shall consider an
13 independent appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of
14 real estate appraisers and the appraisal was conducted within 6 months of the valuation date. If the Montana

20 subsection (3)(a). The appraisal that is provided by the taxpayer is presumed to establish assessed value in the
21 Montana board proceeding unless the department provides sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of
