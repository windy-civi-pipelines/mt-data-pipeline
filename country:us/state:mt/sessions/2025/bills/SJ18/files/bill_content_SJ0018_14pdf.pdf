8 world, measuring 191 square miles in area, up to 370 feet deep, with 187 miles of shoreline; and
9 WHEREAS, fed by the Flathead and Swan Rivers, the lake is considered one of the cleanest in the

14 hundreds of private and public boat docks; and
15 WHEREAS, although federal regulations require the lake to be brought to full pool by June 15 for
16 summer recreation, decisions by federal agencies, dam operators, and interests outside the Flathead Lake

18 it; and
19 WHEREAS, the ongoing renegotiation of the Columbia River Treaty presents an opportunity to improve
20 management of the lake to optimize its use for those who live on or near it; and
21 WHEREAS, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Columbia River System Operations planning defines
22 operating procedures for each dam in the Columbia River system, including the Hungry Horse and Seli'š
23 Ksanka Qlispe' dams, to manage pool levels for floods, fish passage and spawning, recreation, water quality,
24 and power generation; and
25 WHEREAS, the Technical Management Team for the Columbia River Basin, composed of
26 representatives from five federal agencies, eight Indian tribes, and four states, including Montana, has made
27 decisions in recent years counter to the recreational interests of Flathead Lake users.
