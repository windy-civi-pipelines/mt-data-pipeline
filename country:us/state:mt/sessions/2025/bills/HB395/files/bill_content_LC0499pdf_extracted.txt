11 Section 4. Section 53-21-127, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "53-21-127. (Temporary) Posttrial disposition. (1) If, upon trial, it is determined that the
13 respondent is not suffering from a mental disorder or does not require commitment within the meaning
14 of this part, the respondent must be discharged and the petition dismissed.
15 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
16 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
17 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
18 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
19 respondent.
20 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
21 the court shall:
22 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
23 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
24 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living

1 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
2 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
3 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
4 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
5 in 53-21-190; or
6 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
7 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
8 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
9 established in administrative rules of the department; and
10 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
11 for admission.
12 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
13 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
14 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
15 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
16 treatment.
17 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
18 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
19 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
20 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
21 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
22 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
23 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
24 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
25 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
26 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
27 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
28 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental

2 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
3 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
4 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
5 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may
6 require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living facility, or a
7 program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and may not require
8 commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health nursing
9 care center.
10 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
11 fact:
12 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
13 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
14 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
15 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
16 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
17 respondent;
18 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
19 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
20 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
21 chosen from among other alternatives;
22 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
23 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
24 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
25 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
26 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
27 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
28 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
- 17 - LC 499
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 0499
1 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
2 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
3 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
4 from among other alternatives.
5 53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and
6 the petition dismissed if, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent:
7 (a) is not suffering from a mental disorder;
8 (b) does not require commitment within the meaning of this part; or
9 (c) is suffering from a mental disorder but the respondent's primary diagnosis is Alzheimer's
10 disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
11 criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).
12 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
13 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
14 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
15 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
16 respondent.
17 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
18 the court shall:
19 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
20 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
21 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
22 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
23 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
24 (i) not more than 3 months; or
25 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
26 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
27 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
28 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of

4 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
5 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
6 established in administrative rules of the department; and
7 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
8 for admission.
9 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
10 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
11 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
12 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
13 treatment.
14 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
15 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
16 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
17 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
18 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
19 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
20 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
21 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
22 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
23 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
24 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
25 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental

1 (7) Except as provided in 53-21-126(7), satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1)
2 justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter. However, if the court relies solely on the criterion provided in 53-

4 assisted living facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and

10 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
11 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;

5 in 53-21-190; or
6 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
7 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
8 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
9 established in administrative rules of the department; and
10 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
11 for admission.
12 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
13 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
14 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
15 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
16 treatment.
17 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
18 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
19 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
20 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
21 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
22 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
23 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
24 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
25 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
26 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
27 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
28 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental

3 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
4 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
5 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may
6 require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living facility, or a
7 program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and may not require
8 commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health nursing
9 care center.
10 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
11 fact:
12 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
13 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
14 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
15 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
16 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
17 respondent;
18 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
19 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
20 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
21 chosen from among other alternatives;
22 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
23 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
24 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
25 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
26 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
27 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
28 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and

1 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
2 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
3 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
4 from among other alternatives.
5 53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and
6 the petition dismissed if, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent:
7 (a) is not suffering from a mental disorder;
8 (b) does not require commitment within the meaning of this part; or
9 (c) is suffering from a mental disorder but the respondent's primary diagnosis is Alzheimer's
10 disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
11 criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).
12 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
13 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
14 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
15 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
16 respondent.
17 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
18 the court shall:
19 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
20 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
21 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
22 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
23 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
24 (i) not more than 3 months; or
25 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
26 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
27 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
28 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of

4 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
5 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
6 established in administrative rules of the department; and
7 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
8 for admission.
9 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
10 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
11 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
12 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
13 treatment.
14 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
15 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
16 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
17 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
18 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
19 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
20 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
21 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
22 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
23 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
24 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
25 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
26 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
27 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The

11 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;

5 "53-21-181. Discharge during or at end of initial commitment period -- patient's right to referral.
6 (1) (a) At any time within the period of commitment provided for in 53-21-127, the patient may be discharged on
7 the written order of the professional person in charge of the patient without further order of the court.
8 (b) If the patient is not discharged within the period of commitment and if the term is not extended
9 as provided for in 53-21-128, a patient whose commitment was to a facility other than a category D assisted
10 living facility must be discharged by the facility at the end of the period of commitment without further order of
11 the court.
12 (c) A patient who was committed to a category D assisted living facility may be discharged from
13 supervision by the court but may remain as a resident if the category D assisted living facility and the patient
14 agree.
15 (2) Notice of the discharge must be filed with the court and the county attorney at least 5 days prior
16 to the discharge. Failure to comply with the notice requirement may not delay the discharge of the patient.
17 (3) Upon being discharged, each patient has a right to be referred, as appropriate, to other
18 providers of mental health services.

3 caused a deterioration of the patient's mental condition, and that as a result of this deterioration, the patient can
4 no longer be appropriately served by outpatient care.
5 (2) A revocation of the patient's conditional release status under subsection (1) must be based on
6 the testimony of the professional person responsible for the patient's case.
7 (3) If the court revokes the patient's conditional release status pursuant to subsection (1), a
8 treatment plan must be updated or a new plan prepared for the patient as required by and within the time set
