13 respondent must be discharged and the petition dismissed.
14 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
15 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
16 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
17 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the

1 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
2 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
3 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
4 in 53-21-190; or
5 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
6 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
7 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
8 established in administrative rules of the department; and
9 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
10 for admission.
11 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
12 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
13 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
14 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
15 treatment.
16 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
17 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
18 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
19 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
20 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
21 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
22 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
23 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
24 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
25 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
26 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
27 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
28 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be

2 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
3 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
4 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may
5 require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living facility, or a
6 program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and may not require
7 commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health nursing
8 care center.
9 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
10 fact:
11 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
12 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
13 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
14 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
15 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
16 respondent;
17 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
18 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
19 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
20 chosen from among other alternatives;
21 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
22 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
23 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
24 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
25 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
26 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
27 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
28 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent

1 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
2 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
3 from among other alternatives.
4 53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and

6 (a) is not suffering from a mental disorder;
7 (b) does not require commitment within the meaning of this part; or
8 (c) is suffering from a mental disorder but the respondent's primary diagnosis is Alzheimer's
9 disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
10 criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).
11 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
12 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
13 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
14 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
15 respondent.
16 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
17 the court shall:
18 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
19 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
20 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
21 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
22 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
23 (i) not more than 3 months; or
24 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
25 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
26 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
27 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of

5 established in administrative rules of the department; and
6 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time

8 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
9 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
10 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
11 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective

1 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
2 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
3 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
4 in 53-21-190; or
5 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
6 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
7 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
8 established in administrative rules of the department; and
9 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
10 for admission.
11 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
12 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
13 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
14 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
15 treatment.
16 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
17 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
18 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
19 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
20 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
21 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
22 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
23 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
24 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
25 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
26 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
27 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
28 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be

1 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
2 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
3 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
4 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may
5 require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living facility, or a
6 program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and may not require
7 commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health nursing
8 care center.
9 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
10 fact:
11 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
12 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
13 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
14 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
15 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
16 respondent;
17 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
18 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
19 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
20 chosen from among other alternatives;
21 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
22 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
23 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
24 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
25 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
26 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
27 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
28 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent

1 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
2 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
3 from among other alternatives.
4 53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and
5 the petition dismissed if, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent:
6 (a) is not suffering from a mental disorder;
7 (b) does not require commitment within the meaning of this part; or
8 (c) is suffering from a mental disorder but the respondent's primary diagnosis is Alzheimer's
9 disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
10 criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).
11 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
12 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
13 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
14 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
15 respondent.
16 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
17 the court shall:
18 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
19 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
20 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
21 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
22 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
23 (i) not more than 3 months; or
24 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
25 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
26 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
27 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
28 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided

4 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
5 established in administrative rules of the department; and
6 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
7 for admission.
8 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
9 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
10 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
11 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
12 treatment.
13 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
14 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
15 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
16 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by

18 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
19 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
20 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
21 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
22 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
23 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
24 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental

7 treatment plan must be updated or a new plan prepared for the patient as required by and within the time set
