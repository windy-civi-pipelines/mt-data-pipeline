street or other easement, and give any additional information that the department requires.
(2) This application must be accompanied by two exact copies of the official plat of the proposed
highway, street, or other easement, verified by the affidavit of the engineer or surveyor who prepared the
application. These plats must show the quantity of land taken by the proposed highway or street or other
easement for each 40-acre tract or government lot of state land over or through which it passes and also the

by the department, these plats must show all these facts for smaller subdivisions as the circumstances may
render desirable for the state.
(3) The application must include the affidavit of a licensed engineer or professional surveyor
stating that the methodology used is known to be accurate to within 5 meters. The survey must be tied to an

measurements need not be given. An exact geographical survey is not required, but the application must
include the description of the location of the center line of the right-of-way that refers to an established

department, heritage property would not be impacted.

75, chapter 6, part 3, the plats and measurements need not be given. An exact geographical survey is not

positioning system data in the Montana coordinate system, the easement location depicted on a topographical
map to a scale of 1:24,000, easement coordinates, and the quantity of land taken in each quarter-quarter

for in 77-2-101(2)(d) 77-2-101(11) when there is sufficient information to define the boundaries of the right-of-
way or easement to record the right-of-way or easement.
