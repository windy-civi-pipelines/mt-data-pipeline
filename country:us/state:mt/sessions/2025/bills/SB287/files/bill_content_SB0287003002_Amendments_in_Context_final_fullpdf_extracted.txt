1 subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
2 adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
3 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
4 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
5 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a
6 business, including bankruptcies, acquisitions, sales of assets, or mergers.
7 (b) If the objection relates to residential or commercial property and the objector agrees to the
8 confidentiality requirements, the department shall provide to the objector, by posted mail or electronically, within
9 8 weeks of submission of the objection, the following information:
10 (i) the methodology and sources of data used by the department in the valuation of the property;
11 and
12 (ii) if the department uses a blend of evaluations developed from various sources, the reasons that
13 the methodology was used.
14 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
15 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
16 electronic form:
17 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
18 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
19 market model area; and
20 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the
21 documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.
22 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
23 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
24 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
25 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
26 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
27 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the

1 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
2 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
3 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
4 department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
5 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
6 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
7 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
8 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
9 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
10 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
11 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
12 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
13 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
14 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
15 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
16 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
17 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
18 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
19 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
20 for making the adjustment.
21 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
22 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
23 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
24 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
25 office hours.
26 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
27 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property

1 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
2 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
3 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
4 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
5 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
6 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
7 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
8 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
9 accordance with the board's order."

11 SECTION 2. SECTION 15-10-420, MCA, IS AMENDED TO READ:
12 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
13 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
14 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
15 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
16 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
17 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
18 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
19 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
20 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
21 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
22 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
23 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
24 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
25 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
26 labor.
27 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any

1 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
2 including newly taxable property.
3 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
4 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
5 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
6 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
7 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
8 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
9 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
10 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
11 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
12 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
13 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
14 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
15 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
16 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
17 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
18 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
19 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
20 following tax year.
21 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
22 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
23 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
24 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
25 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
26 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
27 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:

1 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or
2 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
3 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
4 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
5 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
6 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
7 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
8 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7); and
9 (c) may not include revenue distributed to a county to provide state property tax assistance
10 pursuant to [section 30].
11 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
12 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
13 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
14 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
15 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
16 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
17 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

20 (iv) a levy for the support of a study commission under 7-3-184;
21 (v) a levy for the support of a newly established regional resource authority;
22 (vi) the portion that is the amount in excess of the base contribution of a governmental entity's
23 property tax levy for contributions for group benefits excluded under 2-9-212 or 2-18-703;
24 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
25 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;

1 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
2 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
3 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) may not be included in the amount of property taxes
4 actually assessed in a subsequent year.
5 (10) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
6 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
7 authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated
8 operating funds by a county or municipality during that time.
9 (11) The department may adopt rules to implement this section. The rules may include a method for
10 calculating the percentage of change in valuation for purposes of determining the elimination of property, new

15 school equalization aid and the cost of the state's wildland fire suppression activities exceeding the amount
16 statutorily appropriated in 10-3-312, and anticipated reversions.
17 (4) If the budget director determines that an amount of actual or projected receipts will result in an
18 amount less than the amount projected to be received in the revenue estimate established pursuant to 5-5-227,

20 amount. Within 20 days of notification, the revenue interim committee shall provide the budget director with any

1 subsection (3)(a)(iv)(A), the property owner may ask the department to consider extenuating circumstances to
2 adjust the value of property described in 15-23-101(2)(b) or (2)(c). Occurrences that may result in an
3 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are
4 material in nature and of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, that are not
5 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a
6 business, including bankruptcies, acquisitions, sales of assets, or mergers.
7 (b) If the objection relates to residential or commercial property and the objector agrees to the
8 confidentiality requirements, the department shall provide to the objector, by posted mail or electronically, within
9 8 weeks of submission of the objection, the following information:
10 (i) the methodology and sources of data used by the department in the valuation of the property;
11 and
12 (ii) if the department uses a blend of evaluations developed from various sources, the reasons that
13 the methodology was used.
14 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
15 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
16 electronic form:
17 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
18 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
19 market model area; and
20 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the
21 documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.
22 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
23 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
24 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
25 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
26 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
27 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the

1 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
2 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
3 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
4 department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
5 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
6 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
7 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
8 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
9 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
10 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
11 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
12 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
13 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
14 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
15 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
16 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
17 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
18 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
19 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
20 for making the adjustment.

22 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
23 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
24 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
25 office hours.

6 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
7 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board

12 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
13 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
14 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
15 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
16 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
17 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
18 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
19 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
20 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
21 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
22 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
23 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
24 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
25 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
26 labor.
27 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any

4 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
5 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
6 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
7 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
8 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
9 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
10 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
11 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
12 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
13 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
14 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
15 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
16 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
17 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
18 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
19 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
20 following tax year.
21 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
22 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
23 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
24 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
25 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
26 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).

3 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
4 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
5 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
6 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
7 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
8 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7); and
9 (c) may not include revenue distributed to a county to provide state property tax assistance
10 pursuant to [section 30].

12 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
13 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
14 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
15 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
16 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
17 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

16 statutorily appropriated in 10-3-312, and anticipated reversions.
17 (4) If the budget director determines that an amount of actual or projected receipts will result in an
