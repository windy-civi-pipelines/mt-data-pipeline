(1) real properties exist across the state where the stigma of hazardous substance and petroleum
contamination hinders the development or best use of the property. These properties may be eligible for

be encouraged and facilitated to reduce threats to human health and the environment, prepare properties for
reuse and redevelopment, and return property to the local tax rolls;
(3) the petroleum tank release cleanup fund established in 75-11-313 does not immediately
address all petroleum tank release sites in Montana;
(4) not all sites impacted by hazardous substances are assessed or cleaned up by the
Comprehensive Environmental Cleanup and Responsibility Act in chapter 10, part 7, of this title or the federal

(ii) a liability at a facility subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Cleanup and Responsibility
Act in accordance with Title 75, chapter 10.

(1) real properties exist across the state where the stigma of hazardous substance and petroleum
contamination hinders the development or best use of the property. These properties may be eligible for

be encouraged and facilitated to reduce threats to human health and the environment, prepare properties for
reuse and redevelopment, and return property to the local tax rolls;
(3) the petroleum tank release cleanup fund established in 75-11-313 does not immediately
address all petroleum tank release sites in Montana;
