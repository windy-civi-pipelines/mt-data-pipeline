18 available from the fund for reimbursement.
19 (b) The board may, at the request of an owner or operator, guarantee in writing reimbursement of
20 eligible costs not yet approved by the board, including estimated costs not yet incurred. A guarantee for
21 payment under this subsection (6)(b) does not affect the order in which money in the fund is obligated under
22 subsection (5).

24 information or documentation from the owner or operator. The board may grant or deny, in whole or in part, any
