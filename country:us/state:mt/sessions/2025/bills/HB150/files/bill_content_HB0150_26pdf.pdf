22 "16-4-801. Security interest in alcoholic beverage license -- definitions. (1) (a) A security interest
23 in an alcoholic beverage license is an interest in the alcoholic beverage license that secures payment or
24 performance of an obligation. A contract for the sale of an alcoholic beverage license, including a provision
25 allowing the seller to retain an ownership interest in the license solely for the purpose of guaranteeing payment
26 for the license, may, for the purposes of this section, be treated as a security interest.
27 (b) For the purposes of this section:
28 (i) "alcoholic beverage license" means a license issued under this chapter; and
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 150

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0150.2
1 (ii) "default" means that:
2 (A) the defaulting party has acknowledged in writing pursuant to the terms of a written security
3 agreement or contract for sale that the defaulting party no longer has any ownership interest or any other rights
4 to possess or control the alcoholic beverage license;
5 (B) a court of competent jurisdiction has made an order foreclosing all of the defaulting party's
6 interests in the license; or
7 (C) there has been a nonjudicial sale by the secured party made pursuant to the Uniform
8 Commercial Code and the secured party has provided written proof of the sale to the department.
9 (2) The department, after review of the underlying documents creating the security interest, may
10 approve a transfer of ownership of an alcoholic beverage license subject to a security interest as provided in
11 subsection (1). A person holding a security interest may not have any control in the operation of the business
12 operated under a license subject to a security interest nor may that person share in the profits or the liabilities of
13 the business other than the payment or performance of the licensee's obligation under a security agreement.
14 (3) (a) Within 7 days of a default by a licensee, the person holding the security interest shall give
15 notice to the department of the licensee's default and either apply to have the license transferred to that person,
16 subject to that person meeting the requirements of 16-4-401 and all other applicable provisions of this code, or
17 the person shall place the license on nonuse status. On receipt of an application to transfer the license, the
18 department may, pursuant to 16-4-433, grant the applicant temporary operating authority to operate the license.
19 If the person holding the license places the license on nonuse status, the person shall transfer ownership of the
20 license within 180 days from the date on which the notice of the default was given to the department. The
21 operation of a business under a license by a person holding a security interest for more than 7 days after
22 default of the licensee or without temporary operating authority issued by the department must be considered to
23 be a violation of this code and constitutes grounds for the department to either deny an application for transfer
24 of the license or for the revocation of the license pursuant to 16-4-406.
25 (b) If the person holding the security interest does not qualify for or cannot qualify for ownership of
26 an alcoholic beverage license under 16-4-401, the secured party shall transfer ownership of the alcoholic
27 beverage license within 180 days of the notice of the default of the licensee.

3 beverage license or in other assets of a business operating an alcoholic beverage license to secure a loan or a
4 guaranty of a loan. A regulated lender may use loan and collateral documentation and loan and collateral
5 structure consistent with that used by the regulated lender in commercial loans generally, and the
6 documentation and structure used by the lender do not create an undisclosed ownership interest in the
7 alcoholic beverage license or the licensee's business by a coborrower, or guarantor, or other person who may
8 directly or indirectly benefit from the pledge of the alcoholic beverage license as collateral, if the alcoholic
9 beverage license is issued or proposed for use on premises that meet the requirements of 16-3-311if the

16 (iii) pledge assets as collateral for a borrower's loan or for a guaranty of a borrower's loan; or
17 (iv) use the license as additional collateral for a loan made by a regulated lender to the owner of
18 the premises where the alcoholic beverage license is located and operated pursuant to contractual terms

18 OPERATION AS COLLATERAL is not the licensee or an owner of the licensee, the coborrower, or guarantor, OR
