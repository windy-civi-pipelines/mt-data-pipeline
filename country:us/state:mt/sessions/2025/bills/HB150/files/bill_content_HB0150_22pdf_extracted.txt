26 allowing the seller to retain an ownership interest in the license solely for the purpose of guaranteeing payment
27 for the license, may, for the purposes of this section, be treated as a security interest.
28 (b) For the purposes of this section:
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 150

69th Legislature 2025 HB0150.2
1 (i) "alcoholic beverage license" means a license issued under this chapter; and
2 (ii) "default" means that:
3 (A) the defaulting party has acknowledged in writing pursuant to the terms of a written security
4 agreement or contract for sale that the defaulting party no longer has any ownership interest or any other rights
5 to possess or control the alcoholic beverage license;
6 (B) a court of competent jurisdiction has made an order foreclosing all of the defaulting party's
7 interests in the license; or
8 (C) there has been a nonjudicial sale by the secured party made pursuant to the Uniform
9 Commercial Code and the secured party has provided written proof of the sale to the department.
10 (2) The department, after review of the underlying documents creating the security interest, may
11 approve a transfer of ownership of an alcoholic beverage license subject to a security interest as provided in
12 subsection (1). A person holding a security interest may not have any control in the operation of the business
13 operated under a license subject to a security interest nor may that person share in the profits or the liabilities of
14 the business other than the payment or performance of the licensee's obligation under a security agreement.
15 (3) (a) Within 7 days of a default by a licensee, the person holding the security interest shall give
16 notice to the department of the licensee's default and either apply to have the license transferred to that person,
17 subject to that person meeting the requirements of 16-4-401 and all other applicable provisions of this code, or
18 the person shall place the license on nonuse status. On receipt of an application to transfer the license, the
19 department may, pursuant to 16-4-433, grant the applicant temporary operating authority to operate the license.
20 If the person holding the license places the license on nonuse status, the person shall transfer ownership of the
21 license within 180 days from the date on which the notice of the default was given to the department. The
22 operation of a business under a license by a person holding a security interest for more than 7 days after
23 default of the licensee or without temporary operating authority issued by the department must be considered to
24 be a violation of this code and constitutes grounds for the department to either deny an application for transfer
25 of the license or for the revocation of the license pursuant to 16-4-406.
26 (b) If the person holding the security interest does not qualify for or cannot qualify for ownership of
27 an alcoholic beverage license under 16-4-401, the secured party shall transfer ownership of the alcoholic
28 beverage license within 180 days of the notice of the default of the licensee.

6 structure consistent with that used by the regulated lender in commercial loans generally, and the
7 documentation and structure used by the lender do not create an undisclosed ownership interest in the

18 (iv) use the license as additional collateral for a loan made by a regulated lender to the owner of

23 "16-4-801. Security interest in alcoholic beverage license -- definitions. (1) (a) A security interest
24 in an alcoholic beverage license is an interest in the alcoholic beverage license that secures payment or
25 performance of an obligation. A contract for the sale of an alcoholic beverage license, including a provision
26 allowing the seller to retain an ownership interest in the license solely for the purpose of guaranteeing payment
27 for the license, may, for the purposes of this section, be treated as a security interest.
28 (b) For the purposes of this section:
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 150

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0150.2
1 (i) "alcoholic beverage license" means a license issued under this chapter; and
2 (ii) "default" means that:
3 (A) the defaulting party has acknowledged in writing pursuant to the terms of a written security
4 agreement or contract for sale that the defaulting party no longer has any ownership interest or any other rights
5 to possess or control the alcoholic beverage license;
6 (B) a court of competent jurisdiction has made an order foreclosing all of the defaulting party's
7 interests in the license; or
8 (C) there has been a nonjudicial sale by the secured party made pursuant to the Uniform
9 Commercial Code and the secured party has provided written proof of the sale to the department.
10 (2) The department, after review of the underlying documents creating the security interest, may
11 approve a transfer of ownership of an alcoholic beverage license subject to a security interest as provided in
12 subsection (1). A person holding a security interest may not have any control in the operation of the business
13 operated under a license subject to a security interest nor may that person share in the profits or the liabilities of
14 the business other than the payment or performance of the licensee's obligation under a security agreement.
15 (3) (a) Within 7 days of a default by a licensee, the person holding the security interest shall give
16 notice to the department of the licensee's default and either apply to have the license transferred to that person,
17 subject to that person meeting the requirements of 16-4-401 and all other applicable provisions of this code, or
18 the person shall place the license on nonuse status. On receipt of an application to transfer the license, the
19 department may, pursuant to 16-4-433, grant the applicant temporary operating authority to operate the license.
20 If the person holding the license places the license on nonuse status, the person shall transfer ownership of the
21 license within 180 days from the date on which the notice of the default was given to the department. The
22 operation of a business under a license by a person holding a security interest for more than 7 days after
23 default of the licensee or without temporary operating authority issued by the department must be considered to
24 be a violation of this code and constitutes grounds for the department to either deny an application for transfer
25 of the license or for the revocation of the license pursuant to 16-4-406.
26 (b) If the person holding the security interest does not qualify for or cannot qualify for ownership of
27 an alcoholic beverage license under 16-4-401, the secured party shall transfer ownership of the alcoholic
28 beverage license within 180 days of the notice of the default of the licensee.

20 collateral documentation and loan and collateral structure consistent with that used by the regulated lender in
21 commercial loans generally, and the documentation and structure used by the lender do not create an
22 undisclosed ownership interest in the licensee's business by a coborrower, or guarantor, or other person who
23 may directly or indirectly benefit from the pledge of the assets as collateral if the department determines the
24 borrower, coborrower, guarantor, and owner or owners of the assets pledged as collateral meet the

8 designate whether the payment will be treated as a loan or an equity investment as follows:

10 agreement, which must be provided to the department; or
11 (ii) for a payment treated as an equity investment, if a change in ownership percentage occurs as
12 a result, the licensee must follow department requirements for disclosing changes in ownership percentages;
13 and
14 (b) the funds used for the payment must be the party's own funds or funds borrowed from an
15 institutional lender.
16 (7) If a borrower, coborrower, or guarantor is not the licensee or an owner of the licensee, the
17 coborrower or guarantor may make a payment on the a licensee's institutional loan, and the payment does not
18 create an undisclosed ownership in the licensee's business by the borrower, coborrower, or guarantor only if:
19 (a) the licensee notifies the department within 90 days that the payment was made;
20 (b) the payment is made as a loan that is memorialized by a written agreement; and
21 (c) the funds used for the payment are the coborrower's or guarantor's own funds or funds
22 borrowed from an institutional lender.
23 (8) A regulated lender that obtains a security interest in the assets of a licensed gambling
24 operation has no duty to ensure a coborrower's or guarantor's compliance with the requirements of subsection
25 (6) or (7) in connection with loan or guaranty payments it may receive from the coborrower or guarantor.
26 (9) For the purposes of subsections (6) and (7), the term "borrower" means the party that is
27 primarily responsible for making payments and that receives the funds or on whose behalf the funds were paid."
