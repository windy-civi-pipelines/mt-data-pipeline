9
10 Section 1. Section 2-15-3112, MCA, is amended to read:
11 "2-15-3112. Livestock loss mitigation program -- definitions. The livestock loss board shall
12 establish and administer a program to reimburse livestock producers for livestock losses caused by wolves,
13 mountain lions, and grizzly bears, subject to the following provisions:
14 (1) The board shall establish eligibility requirements for reimbursement, which must provide that all
15 Montana livestock producers are eligible for coverage for losses by wolves, mountain lions, and grizzly bears to
16 cattle, domestic bison, swine, horses, mules, sheep, goats, llamas, and livestock guard dogs on state, federal,
17 tribal, and private land.
18 (2) (a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), the board may reimburse confirmed and probable
19 livestock losses at an amount not to exceed the fair market value of the livestock.
20 (b) The board may reimburse confirmed and probable livestock losses by paying a multiplier of the
21 fair market value of the livestock based on a board-determined region.
22 (c) Before the board may issue a reimbursement for losses to a livestock producer eligible for
23 coverage for losses, the department of revenue shall certify that the livestock producer has paid per capita fees
24 as required by 15-24-921. Except for a tribal member or tribal entity participating in an authorized agreement
25 pursuant to 2-15-3113, a livestock producer may not receive a reimbursement for losses until the producer has
26 paid any delinquent per capita fees.
27 (3) Other losses may be reimbursed at rates determined by the board.
28 (4) A claim process must be established to be used when a livestock producer suffers a livestock

1 loss for which wolves, mountain lions, or grizzly bears may be responsible. The claim process must set out a
2 clear and concise method for documenting and processing claims for reimbursement for livestock losses.
3 (5) Names, addresses, and other personally identifiable information of claimants must remain
4 confidential and may not be released.
5 (6) (a) A process must be established to allow livestock producers to appeal reimbursement
6 decisions. A producer may appeal a staff adjuster's decision by notifying the staff adjuster and the board in
7 writing, stating the reasons for the appeal and providing documentation supporting the appeal. If the
8 documentation is incomplete, the board or a producer may consult with the U.S. department of agriculture
9 wildlife services to complete the documentation.
10 (b) The board may not accept any appeal on the question of whether the loss was or was not a
11 confirmed or probable loss because that final determination lies solely with the U.S. department of agriculture
12 wildlife services and may not be changed by the board.
13 (c) The board shall hold a hearing on an appeal within 90 days of receipt of the written appeal,
14 allowing the staff adjuster and the producer to present their positions. A decision must be rendered by the
15 board within 30 days after the hearing. The producer must be notified in writing of the board's decision.
16 (7) As used in this section, the following definitions apply:
17 (a) "Confirmed" means reasonable physical evidence that livestock was actually attacked or killed
18 by a wolf, mountain lion, or grizzly bear, including but not limited to the presence of bite marks indicative of the
19 spacing of tooth punctures of wolves, mountain lions, or grizzly bears and associated subcutaneous
20 hemorrhaging and tissue damage indicating that the attack occurred while the animal was alive, feeding
21 patterns on the carcass, fresh tracks, scat, hair rubbed off on fences or brush, eyewitness accounts, or other
22 physical evidence that allows a reasonable inference of wolf, mountain lion, or grizzly bear predation on an
23 animal that has been largely consumed.
24 (b) "Fair market value" means:
25 (i) for commercial sheep more than 1 year old, the average price of sheep of similar age and sex
26 paid at the most recent Billings livestock sale ring or other ring as determined by the board;
27 (ii) for commercial lambs, the average market weaning value;
28 (iii) for registered sheep, twice the average value of commercial sheep of the same age and sex;

1 (iv) for commercial cattle more than 1 year old, the average price of cattle of similar age and sex
2 paid at the most recent Billings livestock sale ring or other ring as determined by the board;
3 (v) for commercial calves, the average market weaning value;
4 (vi) for registered cattle, twice the average value of commercial cattle of the same age and sex;
5 (vii) for domestic bison, twice the average value of commercial cattle of the same age and sex;
6 (vii) (viii) for other registered livestock, twice the average value of commercial-grade animals of
7 the same breed, age, and sex; or
8 (viii) (ix)for other livestock, the average price paid at the most recent public auction for the type of
9 animal lost or the replacement price as determined by the board.
10 (c) "Probable" means the presence of some evidence to suggest possible predation but a lack of
11 sufficient evidence to clearly confirm predation by a particular species. A kill may be classified as probable
12 depending on factors including but not limited to recent confirmed predation by the suspected depredating
13 species in the same or a nearby area, recent observation of the livestock by the owner or the owner's
14 employees, and telemetry monitoring data, sightings, howling, or fresh tracks suggesting that the suspected
15 depredating species may have been in the area when the depredation occurred."
