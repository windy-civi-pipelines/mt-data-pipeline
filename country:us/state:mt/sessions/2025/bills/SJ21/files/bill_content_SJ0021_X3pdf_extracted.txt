Section 1:
69th Legislature SJ 21
MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY ON INTERSTATE POWER GRID DEVELOPMENT; AND
REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, the modernization and expansion of electric transmission infrastructure is essential to
ensuring a secure, reliable, and cost-effective energy supply for Montana and its neighboring states; and
WHEREAS, restrictive and anticompetitive policies in certain jurisdictions hinder the development of
necessary transmission projects, resulting in increased costs to ratepayers and inefficiencies in energy
markets; and
WHEREAS, the establishment of an interstate compact could facilitate a cooperative framework among
states to enhance market-driven solutions, reduce regulatory barriers, and encourage open bidding processes
for new transmission projects; and
WHEREAS, a comprehensive study is necessary to evaluate the potential benefits, legal
considerations, and implementation strategies of an interstate compact to ensure equitable access to
transmission infrastructure and cost-sharing mechanisms that fairly allocate expenses among all beneficiaries;
and
WHEREAS, an interstate compact should adhere to key principles, including technology neutrality,
uniform siting and certification processes, streamlined permitting, and the promotion of grid-enhancing
technologies to maximize efficiency and minimize costs; and
WHEREAS, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's order RM99-2-000 encourages state
adoption of regional transmission organizations and interstate compacts to enhance market efficiency, improve
reliability, facilitate just and holistic energy transmission pricing, and streamline electric transmission pricing;

ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature SJ 21
WHEREAS, President Donald J. Trump declared a national energy emergency on January 20, 2025,
and through his public statements and executive orders encouraged a national energy policy focused on
increasing energy production, enhancing infrastructure, and reducing regulatory barriers to support economic
growth, emerging technologies, and national security, including the establishment of a National Energy
Dominance Council to further increase United States energy production, aiming to enhance the
interconnectivity and robustness of the energy infrastructure.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
aThat the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
committee, pursuant to section 5-5-217, MCA, or direct sufficient staff resources to:
(1) evaluate the legal and regulatory framework for Montana to participate in new cooperative
interstate agreements for electric transmission;
(2) examine the potential economic benefits and cost implications of a compact for Montana
ratepayers and industries;
(3) assess how an interstate compact can incorporate market-based principles to maximize
competition and minimize costs for consumers;
(4) explore best practices from other states and regional transmission organizations that have
implemented similar cooperative agreements;
(5) consider mechanisms to streamline the permitting process and eliminate duplicative regulatory
requirements for transmission projects;
(6) analyze the implications of federal regulatory requirements and how an interstate compact or
similar arrangements may facilitate compliance while preserving state sovereignty; and
(7) engage and consider input from relevant stakeholders, including representatives from the
energy industry, consumer advocacy groups, regulatory agencies, and legal experts.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the study is assigned to staff, any findings or conclusions be
presented to and reviewed by an appropriate committee designated by the Legislative Council.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all aspects of the study, including presentation and review
