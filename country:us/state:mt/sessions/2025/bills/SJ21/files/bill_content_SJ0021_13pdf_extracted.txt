8 WHEREAS, the modernization and expansion of electric transmission infrastructure is essential to
9 ensuring a secure, reliable, and cost-effective energy supply for Montana and its neighboring states; and
10 WHEREAS, restrictive and anticompetitive policies in certain jurisdictions hinder the development of
11 necessary transmission projects, resulting in increased costs to ratepayers and inefficiencies in energy
12 markets; and
13 WHEREAS, the establishment of an interstate compact could facilitate a cooperative framework among
14 states to enhance market-driven solutions, reduce regulatory barriers, and encourage open bidding processes
15 for new transmission projects; and
16 WHEREAS, a comprehensive study is necessary to evaluate the potential benefits, legal
17 considerations, and implementation strategies of an interstate compact to ensure equitable access to
18 transmission infrastructure and cost-sharing mechanisms that fairly allocate expenses among all beneficiaries;
19 and
20 WHEREAS, an interstate compact should adhere to key principles, including technology neutrality,
21 uniform siting and certification processes, streamlined permitting, and the promotion of grid-enhancing
22 technologies to maximize efficiency and minimize costs; and
23 WHEREAS, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's order RM99-2-000 encourages state
24 adoption of regional transmission organizations and interstate compacts to enhance market efficiency, improve
25 reliability, facilitate just and holistic energy transmission pricing, and streamline electric transmission pricing;

15 competition and minimize costs for consumers;
16 (4) explore best practices from other states and regional transmission organizations that have
17 implemented similar cooperative agreements;
18 (5) consider mechanisms to streamline the permitting process and eliminate duplicative regulatory
19 requirements for transmission projects;
20 (6) analyze the implications of federal regulatory requirements and how an interstate compact or
21 similar arrangements may facilitate compliance while preserving state sovereignty; and
22 (7) engage and consider input from relevant stakeholders, including representatives from the
23 energy industry, consumer advocacy groups, regulatory agencies, and legal experts.
24 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the study is assigned to staff, any findings or conclusions be
