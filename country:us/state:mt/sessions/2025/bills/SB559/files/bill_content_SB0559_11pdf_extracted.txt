15 issued its decision, and the board or the district court may not consider any issue that was not presented to the
16 department for the department's consideration during the formal comment period unless the issue is related to a
17 material change in federal or state law made during the comment period, to a judicial decision issued after the

26 without a reasonable basis in law or fact.

2 control technology requirements, the board or the district court shall give deference to the best available control
3 technology determination made by the department. The board or the district court may not reject the best
4 available control technology determination unless the determination was incorrect as a matter of law or the
5 factual basis for the determination was clearly erroneous.
6 (2) The board shall issue a final decision within 4 months from the close of the hearing on the
7 merits or, if no hearing is held, within 3 months from the date that briefing by the parties is complete unless the

10 (3) (a) Any requirement in a permit to commence construction, installation, or alteration within a
11 certain time period is tolled during a contested case or judicial review proceeding, but not by more than 12
12 months, unless the applicant or permittee in its discretion waives the tolling in writing.
