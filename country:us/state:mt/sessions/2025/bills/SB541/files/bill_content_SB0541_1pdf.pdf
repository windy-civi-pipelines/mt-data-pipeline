4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF MONTANA'S
5 POLLINATORS; CREATING A POLLINATOR HEALTH TASK FORCE; ESTABLISHING REPORTING
6 REQUIREMENTS; PROVIDING AN APPROPRIATION; AND PROVIDING EFFECTIVE DATES AND A
7 TERMINATION DATE.”
8
9 WHEREAS, the Legislature finds that more than 75% of the world's flowering plants and about 35% of
10 the world's food crops depend on pollinators to reproduce; and
11 WHEREAS, honeybees, wild bees, and other pollinators are responsible for the production of tree
12 fruits, small fruits, alfalfa seed, and other crops, contributing an estimated $34 billion in economic value to the
13 United States annually; and
14 WHEREAS, beyond agriculture, pollinators are keystone species in the terrestrial ecosystems of
15 Montana, with fruit and seeds derived from insect pollination providing a major part of the diet of numerous
16 birds and mammal species; and
17 WHEREAS, the state has experienced pollinator habitat loss through property conversion,
18 fragmentation, and degradation of land, and with the state's population continuing to grow at a fast pace, the
19 additional loss of habitat is a significant concern; and
20 WHEREAS, the Legislature intends by this act to initiate a concerted effort to protect and expand the
21 habitat on which pollinators depend by coordinating with other state agencies and local governments in
22 promoting practices to ensure sustainable, healthy populations of managed and wild pollinators.
