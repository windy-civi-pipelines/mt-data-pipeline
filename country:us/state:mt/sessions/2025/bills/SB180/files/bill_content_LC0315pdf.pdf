69th Legislature 2025 LC 0315
1 (l) whether the child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents, which is considered to
2 be in the child's best interests unless the court determines, after a hearing, that contact with a parent would be
3 detrimental to the child's best interests. In making that determination, the court shall consider evidence of
4 physical abuse or threat of physical abuse by one parent against the other parent or the child, including but not
5 limited to whether a parent or other person residing in that parent's household has been convicted of any of the
6 crimes enumerated in 40-4-219(8)(b).
7 (m) adverse effects on the child resulting from continuous and vexatious parenting plan
8 amendment actions; and
9 (n) the credal, cultural, ethnic, or religious needs of the child related to the child's heritage,
10 including the child's Indian heritage regardless of the child's tribal enrollment status or Indian blood quantum.
11 (2) When considering the needs of a child related to the child's heritage, including Indian heritage,
12 the court shall consider the traditions and customs of any social group or peoples to which the child has a direct
13 social, familial, or ancestral connection. These traditions and customs must include but are not limited to:
14 (a) sacred and secular beliefs;
15 (b) social, political, and economic practices; and
16 (c) historical and contemporary connections to a recognized geographic site or area.
17 (3) When determining the best interest of the child of a parent in military service, the court shall
18 consider all relevant parenting factors provided in subsection (1) and may not determine the best interest of the
19 child based only upon on the parent's military service.
20 (4) A de facto parenting arrangement, in the absence of a prior parenting decree, does not require
21 the child's parent or parents to prove the factors set forth in 40-4-219.
22 (5) The following are rebuttable presumptions and apply unless contrary to the best interest of the
23 child:
24 (a) A parenting plan action brought by a parent within 6 months after a child support action against
25 that parent is vexatious.
26 (b) A motion to amend a final parenting plan pursuant to 40-4-219 is vexatious if a parent seeks to
27 amend a final parenting plan without making a good faith effort to comply with the provisions of the parenting
28 plan or with dispute resolution provisions of the final parenting plan."
