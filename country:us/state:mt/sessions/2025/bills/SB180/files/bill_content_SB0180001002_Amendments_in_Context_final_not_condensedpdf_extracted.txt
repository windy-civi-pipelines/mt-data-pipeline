3 (l) whether the child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents, which is considered to
4 be in the child's best interests unless the court determines, after a hearing, that contact with a parent would be
5 detrimental to the child's best interests. In making that determination, the court shall consider evidence of
6 physical abuse or threat of physical abuse by one parent against the other parent or the child, including but not
7 limited to whether a parent or other person residing in that parent's household has been convicted of any of the

21 child based only upon on the parent's military service.
22 (3)(4) A de facto parenting arrangement, in the absence of a prior parenting decree, does not require
23 the child's parent or parents to prove the factors set forth in 40-4-219.
24 (4)(5) The following are rebuttable presumptions and apply unless contrary to the best interest of the
25 child:

27 that parent is vexatious.
28 (b) A motion to amend a final parenting plan pursuant to 40-4-219 is vexatious if a parent seeks to
