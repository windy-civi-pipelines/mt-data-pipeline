18 a mill levy sufficient to generate an inflation adjustment the amount of property taxes actually assessed in the
19 prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years. The maximum number of mills that
20 a governmental entity may impose is established by adding the fiscal year 2025 mill levy to calculating the
21 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
22 the prior year inflation adjustment based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable

24 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
25 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
26 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
27 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
28 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average

13 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
14 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
15 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the

18 a mill levy sufficient to generate an inflation adjustment the amount of property taxes actually assessed in the
19 prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years. The maximum number of mills that

21 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
22 the prior year inflation adjustment based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable
