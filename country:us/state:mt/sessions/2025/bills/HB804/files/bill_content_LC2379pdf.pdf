11 Section 1. Section 5-7-112, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "5-7-112. Payment threshold -- inflation adjustment. For calendar year 2004 2025, the payment
13 threshold referred to in 5-7-102(12)(b)(iii), 5-7-103, and 5-7-208 is $2,150 $3,000. The commissioner shall
14 adjust the threshold amount following a general election each even-numbered year by multiplying the threshold
15 amount valid for the even year in which the general election was held by an inflation factor, adopted by the
16 commissioner by rule. The rule must be written to reflect the annual average change in the consumer price
17 index from the prior year to the year in which the general election is held. The inflation factor is determined by
18 dividing the consumer price index for June of the even-numbered year by the consumer price index for June of
19 the prior year. The resulting figure must be rounded up or down to the nearest $50 increment. The
20 commissioner shall adopt the adjusted amount by rule, effective on January 1 of the following odd year."
