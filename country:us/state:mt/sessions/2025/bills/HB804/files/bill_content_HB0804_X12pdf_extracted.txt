Section 2:
Section 1. Section 5-7-112, MCA, is amended to read:
"5-7-112. Payment threshold -- inflation adjustment. For calendar year 2004 2025, the payment
threshold referred to in 5-7-102(12)(b)(iii), 5-7-103, and 5-7-208 is $2,150 $3,000. The commissioner shall
adjust the threshold amount following a general election each even-numbered year by multiplying the threshold
amount valid for the even year in which the general election was held by an inflation factor, adopted by the
commissioner by rule. The rule must be written to reflect the annual average change in the consumer price
index from the prior year to the year in which the general election is held. The inflation factor is determined by
dividing the consumer price index for June of the even-numbered year by the consumer price index for June of
the prior year. The resulting figure must be rounded up or down to the nearest $50 increment. The
commissioner shall adopt the adjusted amount by rule, effective on January 1 of the following odd year."

commissioner a report electronic reports of payments made for the purpose of lobbying. A principal is subject to
the reporting requirements of this section only if the principal makes total payments for the purpose of lobbying
that exceed the amount specified under 5-7-112 during a calendar year.
