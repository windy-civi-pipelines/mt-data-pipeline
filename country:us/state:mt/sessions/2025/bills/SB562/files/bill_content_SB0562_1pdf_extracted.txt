21 nomination, selection to advance, or election or to remove a person from office, the nomination, selection to
22 advance, or election of the candidate is not by reason of the offense or omission complained of void and the
23 candidate may not be removed from or deprived of office if under the circumstances it seems to the court to be
24 unjust that the candidate forfeit a nomination, selection to advance, or office or be deprived of any office of
25 which the candidate is the incumbent. The decision of the court must be based upon the following:
26 (1) it appears from the evidence that the offense complained of was not committed by the
27 candidate or with the candidate's knowledge or consent or was committed without the candidate's sanction or
28 connivance and that all reasonable means for preventing the commission of the offense at the election were

11 person was guilty of any corrupt practice, illegal act, or undue influence in or about the nomination, selection to
12 advance, or election, the person must be punished by being deprived of the nomination, selection to advance,
13 or office and the vacancy must be filled in the manner provided by law. The only exceptions to this judgment

21 (1) that the candidate, or nominee, or person selected to advance whose right is contested had
22 knowledge of or connived in the illegal votes; or
23 (2) that the number of illegal votes given to the person whose right to the nomination, selection to

3 Section 3. Section 5-2-402, MCA, is amended to read:
4 "5-2-402. Appointment by board of county commissioners -- county central committee role --

6 occurs in the legislature, the vacancy must be filled by appointment by the board of county commissioners or, in
7 the event of a multicounty district, the boards of county commissioners of the counties comprising the district
8 sitting as one appointing board.
9 (2) (a) Whenever a vacancy as described in 2-16-501 is within a single county, the board of county
10 commissioners shall make the appointment as described in 5-2-403, 5-2-404, or 5-2-406.

26 receiving the two highest numbers. If neither vote results in a candidate receiving a number higher than 50 from
27 the calculation provided in subsection (2)(b)(ii), then 5-2-404 applies.

2 cast for the senatorial candidates at the last election in which votes were cast for a senate candidate. Only the
3 number of votes cast by electors residing in the new senate district for senate candidates of the party to which
4 the person vacating the seat belonged may be counted. The secretary of state shall provide an estimate of the
5 number of votes cast for each party by county or portion of a county. The selection process is the same as
6 provided in subsection (2)(b)(iii).
7 (3) The appointment process to fill a vacancy in the legislature under this section is as follows:

9 county commissioners and if the vacating legislator marked a party preference on the legislator's most recent
10 declaration of candidacy, the secretary of state shall notify the state party that is responsible for notifying the
11 county central committee of the county where the vacating legislator is a resident, if the legislative seat is within
12 one county, or the boards of county commissioners and the corresponding county central committees if the

14 there is no county central committee did not mark a party preference or marked "independent" as the party
15 preference on the legislator's most recent declaration of candidacy, the notification of county commissioners
16 suffices.

18 days to propose a list of prospective appointees, pursuant to 5-2-403(1). The county central committee or the
19 county central committees, acting together, shall forward the list of names to the appointing board within the 45-

26 2-403 or from a list of three individuals if the predecessor served as an independent did not declare a party
