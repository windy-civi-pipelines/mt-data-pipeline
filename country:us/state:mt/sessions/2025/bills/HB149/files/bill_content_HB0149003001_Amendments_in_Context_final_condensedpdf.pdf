16 WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of the United States is considering Wages and White Lion Investments
17 LLC, dba Triton Distribution v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, No. 23-1038, a case that will address the
18 FDA's administrative restrictions on the alternative nicotine and vapor product industry. In this case, the U.S.
19 5th Circuit Court of Appeals already condemned the FDA's rules, finding the imposed requisites "unfair" and
20 that the FDA "unexpectedly demanded" requirements of the alternative nicotine and vapor industry that were
21 not in the enacting legislation; and
22 WHEREAS, in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024), the Supreme Court
23 overturned its 1984 decision in Chevron USA Inc. v. Natural Resource Defense Council, 468 US 1227 (1984),
24 holding that it was fundamentally misguided to give judicial deference to agency interpretation of statutes; and
25 WHEREAS, if the Supreme Court follows Loper, then FDA rules and restrictions arbitrarily created by
26 the agency and foisted on the alternative nicotine and vapor product industry will likely be overturned, leaving a
27 regulatory vacuum that gives rise to this act.
