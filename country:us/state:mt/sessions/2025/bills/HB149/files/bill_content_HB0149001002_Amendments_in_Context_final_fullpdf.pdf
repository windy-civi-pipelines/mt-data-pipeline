4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT GENERALLY REVISING LAWS RELATING TO ALTERNATIVE
5 NICOTINE AND VAPOR PRODUCTS; ESTABLISHING THAT ALTERNATIVE NICOTINE AND VAPOR
6 PRODUCTS ARE SEPARATE FROM TOBACCO REGULATIONS; PROVIDING DEFINITIONS; PROVIDING

14 WHEREAS, the Supreme Court of the United States is considering Wages and White Lion Investments
15 LLC, dba Triton Distribution v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, No. 23-1038, a case that will address the
16 FDA's administrative restrictions on the alternative nicotine and vapor product industry. In this case, the U.S.
17 5th Circuit Court of Appeals already condemned the FDA's rules, finding the imposed requisites "unfair" and
18 that the FDA "unexpectedly demanded" requirements of the alternative nicotine and vapor industry that were
19 not in the enacting legislation; and
20 WHEREAS, in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024), the Supreme Court
21 overturned its 1984 decision in Chevron USA Inc. v. Natural Resource Defense Council, 468 US 1227 (1984),
22 holding that it was fundamentally misguided to give judicial deference to agency interpretation of statutes; and
23 WHEREAS, if the Supreme Court follows Loper, then FDA rules and restrictions arbitrarily created by
24 the agency and foisted on the alternative nicotine and vapor product industry will likely be overturned, leaving a
25 regulatory vacuum that gives rise to this act.
