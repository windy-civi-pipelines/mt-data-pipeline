the applicable Medicare administrative contractor; and

of a provider's cost report and subsequent adjustment after a desk review or audit of the cost report is
performed by the applicable medicare administrative contractor.

hospital, as defined 50-5-101.

Section 4:
Section 3. Retroactive adjustment and settlement of cost report. (1) (a) To reimburse a provider

adjustment when a cost report is received by the applicable medicare administrative contractor.
(b) Costs must be accepted as reported except for obvious errors or inconsistencies, subject to
adjustment by a later audit.
(c) The department shall make an interim settlement of the report and, if applicable, payment to
the provider within 240 days after receipt of the cost report by the medicare administrative contractor or within

indicated by the interim cost settlement to repay the amount of the overpayment, or to have an agreed upon
repayment schedule.
(2) (a) Upon receipt of the final desk review or audit of the cost report by the applicable medicare
administrative contractor, the department shall perform a final retroactive adjustment and, if applicable, a final
settlement of the cost report.
