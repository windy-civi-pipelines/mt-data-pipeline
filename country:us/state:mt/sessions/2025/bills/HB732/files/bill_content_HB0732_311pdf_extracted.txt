9
10 WHEREAS, critical access hospitals in Montana participating in the Montana Medicaid program are
11 reimbursed for medical services provided to their communities based on the cost of delivering these services;
12 and
13 WHEREAS, to effectuate this reimbursement, the critical access hospital submits a cost report to the
14 applicable Medicare administrative contractor identifying the cost of services, which forms the basis for settling
15 interim payments to ensure the Medicare and Medicaid programs have paid the proper amount in
16 reimbursement; and
17 WHEREAS, the Medicare program performs an interim settlement upon the filing of a cost report with
18 the applicable Medicare administrative contractor; and
19 WHEREAS, a Medicare administrative contractor periodically performs a desk audit to review
20 previously filed cost reports, and Medicare will perform an additional adjustment as required based upon the

23 cost report and instead waits to settle cost reports until the Medicare administrative contractor has performed
24 the final desk audit; and
