9
10 WHEREAS, critical access hospitals in Montana participating in the Montana Medicaid program are
11 reimbursed for medical services provided to their communities based on the cost of delivering these services;
12 and
13 WHEREAS, to effectuate this reimbursement, the critical access hospital submits a cost report to the
14 applicable Medicare administrative contractor identifying the cost of services, which forms the basis for settling
15 interim payments to ensure the Medicare and Medicaid programs have paid the proper amount in
16 reimbursement; and
17 WHEREAS, the Medicare program performs an interim settlement upon the filing of a cost report with
18 the applicable Medicare administrative contractor; and
19 WHEREAS, a Medicare administrative contractor periodically performs a desk audit to review
20 previously filed cost reports, and Medicare will perform an additional adjustment as required based upon the
21 final desk audit; and
22 WHEREAS, the Montana Medicaid program does not perform initial settlements upon the filing of the
23 cost report and instead waits to settle cost reports until the Medicare administrative contractor has performed
24 the final desk audit; and
25 WHEREAS, Montana Medicaid's practice of waiting to settle cost reports until the final desk audit is
26 performed has resulted in multiple-year delays in settling reimbursement for participating critical access
27 hospitals whose cost reports are selected for a Medicare audit; and

16 with the procedures utilized by the medicare program. This includes prompt initial settlement upon submission
17 of a provider's cost report and subsequent adjustment after a desk review or audit of the cost report is
18 performed by the applicable medicare administrative contractor.
19 (3) [Sections 1 through 3] apply to annual cost reports when submitted by a critical access
20 hospital, as defined 50-5-101.

24 a tentative retroactive adjustment when a cost report is received by the applicable medicare administrative
25 contractor.
26 (b) Costs must be accepted as reported except for obvious errors or inconsistencies, subject to
27 adjustment by a later audit.
