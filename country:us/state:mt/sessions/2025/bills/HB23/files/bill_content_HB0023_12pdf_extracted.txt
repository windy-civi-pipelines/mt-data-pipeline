13 "20-9-311. Calculation of average number belonging (ANB) -- 3-year averaging. (1) Average
14 number belonging (ANB) must be computed for each budget unit as follows:
15 (a) compute an average enrollment by adding a count of regularly enrolled pupils who were
16 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
17 the first Monday in February last Monday in January of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if
18 those dates do not fall on a school day, and divide the sum by two; and
19 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
20 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
21 (2) For the purpose purposes of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-
22 instruction-related days may be included in the calculation.
23 (3) When a school district has approval to operate less than the minimum aggregate hours under
24 20-9-806, the total ANB must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of 20-9-805.
