6 on finding that:

18 (a) the offender has maintained a clean record during their period of registration; and
19 (b) continued registration is not necessary for public protection and that relief from registration is in
20 the best interests of society.

6 subsections (2)(e) and (3) is closed to the public, the judge shall permit a victim of the offense to be present
7 unless the judge determines that exclusion of the victim is necessary to protect the offender's right of privacy or
8 the safety of the victim. If the victim is present, the judge, at the victim's request, shall permit the presence of an
9 individual to provide support to the victim unless the judge determines that exclusion of the individual is

12 (a) a violation of 45-5-503 if:
13 (i) the victim was compelled to submit by force, as defined in 45-5-501, against the victim or
