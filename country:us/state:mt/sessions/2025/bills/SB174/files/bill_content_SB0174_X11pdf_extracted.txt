the purpose of disclosing facts pertaining to boundary locations.
(2) "Cluster development" means a subdivision with lots clustered in a group of five or more lots

(3) "Dedication" means the deliberate appropriation of land by an owner for any general and public

the reviewing authority is not the governing body.

body, that is designated by the governing body to review subdivision applications prior to the subdivider
submitting the application;
