7 WHEREAS, from 1945 to 1962, the United States government conducted over 200 above-ground
8 nuclear tests, exposing tens of thousands of people in downwind areas to deadly radiation; and
9 WHEREAS, Montana is one of the most impacted "downwind" states and home to 15 of the 25 most
10 exposed counties in the United States, including Meagher, Broadwater, Beaverhead, Chouteau, Jefferson,
11 Powell, Judith Basin, Madison, Fergus, Gallatin, Petroleum, Lewis and Clark, Blaine, Silver Bow, and Deer
12 Lodge Counties; and
13 WHEREAS, this issue is important to many Montanans who have suffered and even died from radiation
14 exposure and may not even know their cancers were caused by our nation's nuclear testing; and
15 WHEREAS, the current compensation available for those impacted by United States nuclear weapons
16 development and testing is still not available for impacted Montanans, even though the 1997 study by the
17 United States government indicated that Montana should be included in the Radiation Exposure Compensation
18 Act.
