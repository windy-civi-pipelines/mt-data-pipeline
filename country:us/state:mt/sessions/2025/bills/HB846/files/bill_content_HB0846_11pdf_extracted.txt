14 and
15 (v) the cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years on

18 than 25% of the district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the
19 decision:
20 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8
21 years;
22 (B) the district's reduction or elimination of instructional staff or programs over the previous 8
23 years; and

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 846.1
1 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
2 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
3 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
4 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
5 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
6 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
7 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
8 shall deny the territory transfer.
9 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
10 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
11 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
12 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section. The county
13 superintendent shall notify the department of revenue of the approval of a petition to transfer territory from one
14 school district to another.
15 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
16 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
17 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
18 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
19 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
20 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
21 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
22 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
23 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
24 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
25 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
26 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
27 invalid for the purposes of this section.
28 (12) If a petition to transfer territory is granted under this section, for the 3 years immediately

7 in [section 1], based on the certified taxable value provided under subsection (12)(b) of this section; and

9 commissioners shall fix and levy one-half of the number of mills for each district's operational levies on the full
10 taxable value of all property within the transferred territory.
11 (13) (a) When a petition to transfer territory is granted for a school district that has paid a
12 reconciliation payment to another school district under [section 3]:
13 (i) the school district to which the territory is transferred shall budget and impose a levy for 3
14 consecutive years following the transfer to generate revenue equal to the most recent reconciliation payment it
15 received from the district from which the territory is transferred; and
16 (ii) the school district imposing the levy shall deposit the revenue in its tuition fund and pay the
17 district from which the territory is transferred an amount equal to the revenue raised in subsection (13)(a)(i) for
18 3 consecutive years following the transfer, with at least half of the annual payment made by December 31 and
19 the remainder made by June 15 of the same fiscal year.
20 (b) The school district from which territory is transferred shall deposit the received payment in its
21 flexibility fund or allocate it among its budgeted funds as determined by the trustees."

69th Legislature 2025 HB 846.1
1 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
2 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
3 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
4 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
5 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
6 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
7 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
8 shall deny the territory transfer.
9 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
10 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
11 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
12 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section. The county
13 superintendent shall notify the department of revenue of the approval of a petition to transfer territory from one
14 school district to another.
15 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
16 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
17 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
18 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
19 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
20 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
21 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
22 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
23 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
24 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
25 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
26 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
27 invalid for the purposes of this section.
28 (12) If a petition to transfer territory is granted under this section, for the 3 years immediately
