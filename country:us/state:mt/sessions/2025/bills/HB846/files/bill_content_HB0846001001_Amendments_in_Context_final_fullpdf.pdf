11 publicly owned and maintained road using the shortest passable route while complying with all applicable
12 speed limits to the school the pupil would attend in the resident school district.
13
14 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Qualification for reconciliation payment -- petition to qualify. (1) A
15 school district that has enrolled and admitted an isolated pupil is qualified for a reconciliation payment as
16 provided in this section when the isolated pupil is a resident of a contiguous school district that has a taxable
17 value of at least $100 million and a taxable value per-ANB that is greater than 1.5 times the taxable value per-
18 ANB in the school district of attendance.

20 the resident school district of an isolated pupil is located, a school district that meets the requirements of

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Pad McCracken, HB0846.001.001
1 a reasonable inquiry to assess the validity of the petition and eligibility for the reconciliation payment. The
2 county superintendent shall exercise their best judgment and make a determination based on available and
3 credible evidence, documentation, and applicable laws and policies. The county superintendent shall afford
4 deference to the petitioner's assertions, ensuring that the evaluation process remains fair, transparent, and

7 credibility of the evidence presented and to better ascertain the facts surrounding the petition.
8 (4) The county superintendent shall complete the inquiry and communicate the findings and
9 determination, including a designation of the number of full-time equivalent isolated pupils enrolled in the school
10 district of attendance, to the petitioner and the resident school district within 30 calendar days from the date of

17 the county superintendent's determination and the objective criteria set forth in [sections 1 through 4]. Filing and
18 serving the petition stays the county superintendent's decision until the court reaches a final determination on
19 the matter. The court shall schedule a hearing at the earliest possible convenience. The court shall review the

8 prior year as approved by the county superintendent pursuant to [section 2(4)] by the mill value per-ANB
9 determined pursuant to subsection (4); and

11 of attendance under subsection (2).
12 (4) The mill value per-ANB for the resident school district under subsection (3)(a) must be
13 calculated by the office of public instruction and reported by May 1 with the information required in 20-9-
14 369(1)(a) to the resident school district and to the school district of attendance based on the certified taxable
15 value of the resident school district for the prior school fiscal year divided by the resident school district's
16 budgeted ANB in the prior school fiscal year.
17 (5) Revenue generated from the reconciliation payment levy imposed on the resident school
18 district pursuant to subsection (4) must be deposited in the tuition fund of the resident school district and used

10 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
11 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
12 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a

24 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
25 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
26 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number

3 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
4 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
5 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
6 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
7 invalid for the purposes of this section.
8 (12) If a petition to transfer territory is granted under this section, for the 3 years immediately

17 commissioners shall fix and levy one-half of the number of mills for each district's operational levies on the full
18 taxable value of all property within the transferred territory.
19 (13) (a) When a petition to transfer territory is granted for a school district that has paid a
20 reconciliation payment to another school district under [section 3]:
21 (i) the school district to which the territory is transferred shall budget and impose a levy for 3
22 consecutive years following the transfer to generate revenue equal to the most recent reconciliation payment it
23 received from the district from which the territory is transferred; and
24 (ii) the school district imposing the levy shall deposit the revenue in its tuition fund and pay the
25 district from which the territory is transferred an amount equal to the revenue raised in subsection (13)(a)(i) for
26 3 consecutive years following the transfer, with at least half of the annual payment made by December 31 and
27 the remainder made by June 15 of the same fiscal year.
