15 and
16 (v) the cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years on
17 the taxable value of the district from which the territory is to be transferred. In cases where in which the
18 cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years is equal to or greater
19 than 25% of the district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the
20 decision:
21 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8
22 years;
23 (B) the district's reduction or elimination of instructional staff or programs over the previous 8
24 years; and

- 7 - LC 1143
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1143
1 hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order.
2 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
3 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
4 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
5 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
6 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
7 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
8 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
9 shall deny the territory transfer.
10 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
11 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
12 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
13 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section. The county
14 superintendent shall notify the department of revenue of the approval of a petition to transfer territory from one
15 school district to another.
16 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
17 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
18 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
19 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
20 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
21 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
22 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
23 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
24 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
25 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
26 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
27 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
28 invalid for the purposes of this section.

1 (12) If a petition to transfer territory is granted under this section, for the 3 years immediately
2 following the transfer:
3 (a) the taxable value of territory transferred must be divided equally between the school district
4 from which the territory is transferred and the school district to which the property is transferred;

6 half of the certified value of the transferred territory in each school district's certified taxable value;
7 (c) each school district shall calculate the mills required for its district operational levies, as defined
8 in [section 1], based on the certified taxable value provided under subsection (12)(b) of this section; and
9 (d) when levying taxes for district operational levies pursuant to 20-9-142, the county
10 commissioners shall fix and levy one-half of the number of mills for each district's operational levies on the full
11 taxable value of all property within the transferred territory.
12 (13) (a) When a petition to transfer territory is granted for a school district that has paid a
13 reconciliation payment to another school district under [section 3]:
14 (i) the school district to which the territory is transferred shall budget and impose a levy for 3
15 consecutive years following the transfer to generate revenue equal to the most recent reconciliation payment it
16 received from the district from which the territory is transferred; and
17 (ii) the school district imposing the levy shall deposit the revenue in its tuition fund and pay the
18 district from which the territory is transferred an amount equal to the revenue raised in subsection (13)(a)(i) for
19 3 consecutive years following the transfer, with at least half of the annual payment made by December 31 and
20 the remainder made by June 15 of the same fiscal year.
21 (b) The school district from which territory is transferred shall deposit the received payment in its
22 flexibility fund or allocate it among its budgeted funds as determined by the trustees."

7 (4) If both the trustees of the receiving and transferring school districts have approved the

9 (5) For any petition that meets the criteria specified in subsection (1) and contains the information
10 required by subsection (3) but that has not been approved in writing by the board of trustees of the school
11 district that would transfer the territory, the county superintendent shall:

1 (i) safety;
2 (ii) cost; and
3 (iii) travel time of students; and
4 (iv) whether there are isolated pupils in the territory proposed for transfer; and
5 (c) the economic viability of the proposed new districts, including but not limited to:
6 (i) the existence of a significant burden on the taxpayers of the district from which the territory will
7 be transferred if the transfer is approved and on the taxpayers of the school district to which the territory is to be
8 transferred if the transfer is rejected;
9 (ii) the significance of any loss in state funding for the students in both the receiving and
10 transferring districts;
11 (iii) the viability of the future bonding capacity of the receiving and transferring districts, including
12 but not limited to the ability of the receiving district and the transferring district to meet minimum bonding
13 requirements;
14 (iv) the ability of the receiving district and the transferring district to maintain sufficient reserves;
15 and
16 (v) the cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years on
17 the taxable value of the district from which the territory is to be transferred. In cases where in which the
18 cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years is equal to or greater
19 than 25% of the district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the
20 decision:
21 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8
22 years;
23 (B) the district's reduction or elimination of instructional staff or programs over the previous 8
24 years; and
25 (C) any increase in district taxes over the previous 8 years and the likely increase in district taxes if

- 7 - LC 1143

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1143
1 hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order.
2 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
3 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
4 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
5 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
6 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
7 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
8 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
9 shall deny the territory transfer.
10 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
11 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
12 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
13 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section. The county
14 superintendent shall notify the department of revenue of the approval of a petition to transfer territory from one
15 school district to another.
16 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
17 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
18 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
19 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
20 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
21 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
22 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
23 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
24 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
25 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
26 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
27 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
28 invalid for the purposes of this section.

12 (13) (a) When a petition to transfer territory is granted for a school district that has paid a
13 reconciliation payment to another school district under [section 3]:
14 (i) the school district to which the territory is transferred shall budget and impose a levy for 3
15 consecutive years following the transfer to generate revenue equal to the most recent reconciliation payment it
16 received from the district from which the territory is transferred; and
17 (ii) the school district imposing the levy shall deposit the revenue in its tuition fund and pay the
18 district from which the territory is transferred an amount equal to the revenue raised in subsection (13)(a)(i) for
19 3 consecutive years following the transfer, with at least half of the annual payment made by December 31 and
20 the remainder made by June 15 of the same fiscal year.
21 (b) The school district from which territory is transferred shall deposit the received payment in its
22 flexibility fund or allocate it among its budgeted funds as determined by the trustees."
