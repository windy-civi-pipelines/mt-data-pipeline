1 "18-4-302. Methods of source selection -- authorization for alternative procurement methods.
2 (1) (a) Unless otherwise authorized by law, all state contracts for supplies and services must be awarded by a
3 source selection method provided for in this title. Supplies or services offered for sale, lease, or rental by public
4 utilities are exempt from this requirement if the prices of the supplies or services are regulated by the public
5 service commission or other governmental authority.
6 (b) When a vendor submits a bid or proposal for the provision of supplies or services, the bid or
7 proposal must include payment of an application fee of $1 to the department. The department shall use the fees
8 collected under this subsection (1)(b) to offset costs of administering the department's transparency website
9 pursuant to 18-4-126(4).
10 (2) When the department or another agency opens bids or proposals, if a supplier's current
11 publicly advertised or established catalog price is received at or before the time that the bids or proposals are
12 opened and is less than the bid of the lowest responsible and responsive bidder or offeror or improves upon the
13 conditions for the best proposal received using the same factors and weights included in the proposal, the
14 department or agency may reject all bids and purchase the supply from that supplier without meeting the
15 requirements of 18-4-303 through 18-4-306.
16 (3) An office supply procured by the department may be purchased by an agency, without meeting
17 the requirements of 18-4-303 through 18-4-306, from a supplier whose publicly advertised price, established
18 catalog price, or discount price offered to the agency is less than the price offered by the department if the
19 office supply conforms in all material respects to the terms, conditions, and quality offered by the department. A
20 state office supply term contract must include a provision by which the contracting parties acknowledge and
21 agree to the provisions of this subsection.
22 (4) (a) Under rules adopted by the department, an agency may request from the department
23 authorization for an alternative procurement method.
24 (b) A request for authorization must specify:
25 (i) the problem to be solved;
26 (ii) the proposed alternative procurement method;
27 (iii) the reasons why the alternative procurement method may be more appropriate than a method
28 authorized by law; and

3 (i) evaluate the request;
4 (ii) approve or deny the request; and
5 (iii) issue a written statement providing the reasons for its decision.
6 (d) Whenever the department approves a request submitted under this section, the department:
7 (i) may authorize the alternative procurement method on a trial basis; and
8 (ii) if the alternative procurement method is employed, shall make a written determination as to the
9 success of the method.
10 (e) If the department determines that the alternative procurement method is successful and should
11 be an alternative that is generally available, it shall promulgate rules that establish the use of the alternative
12 procurement method as an additional source selection method. The rules promulgated by the department under
13 this subsection must reflect the purposes described in 18-4-122."
