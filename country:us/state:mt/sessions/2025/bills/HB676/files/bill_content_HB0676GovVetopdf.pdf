RE: Request for Veto on HB 676, Generally Revise State
Land and Water Laws
The Honorable Governor Greg Gianforte,
The Montana Stockgrowers Association (MSGA) greatly appreciates your commitment to
protecting one of Montana’s most precious resources and your leadership in working to make
Montana’s water and state trust lands policy better. We also applaud the work of Lt. Governor
Juras and the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) in educating
legislators and opposing House Bill (HB) 676. We are writing today with deep concerns
about HB 676, and respectfully urge you to veto the bill.
HB 676 complicates nearly 50 years of work done in the adjudication of water rights. MSGA
was steadfast in our efforts to oppose HB 676 throughout the legislative process, and continue
to do so through this request.
For decades, Montana’s ranchers and landowners have worked in good faith to bring certainty
and finality to our water rights system through the state’s water adjudication process. We’ve
invested time, resources, and legal fees to get these rights settled, often over the course of a
generation. HB 676 threatens to unravel that progress.
If enacted, HB 676 risks delaying the completion of Montana’s water adjudication, a process
that is already nearing its final stages after multiple decades of work. Even more troubling, it
opens the door to reopening previously settled water rights, potentially throwing thousands of
existing water rights into uncertainty. For producers who depend on secure water rights to plan
for livestock, irrigation, and drought resilience, that kind of legal instability is unacceptable.
Montana’s agricultural community has always led the way in preserving the state’s natural
resources. We’ve played by the rules, shown up during the adjudication process, and honored
our responsibilities as stewards of the land. Changing the rules now, after so much effort has
been invested, feels like a step backward.
Governor, MSGA urges you to stand with Montana’s ranchers and uphold Montana’s Water
Use Act, the comprehensive statewide water adjudication process, and our state trust lands by
vetoing HB 676. Let’s keep Montana’s water adjudication on track and ensure the rights we’ve
worked to finalize remain secure for generations to come.
Thank you for considering our veto request of HB 676.
Sincerely,
Raylee A. Honeycutt
Executive Vice President

Re: Veto Request of HB676, Generally Revise State Land and Water Laws
The Honorable Governor Gianforte:
Thank you for your continued commitment to the integrity of Montana’s Water Use
Act and to the shared land and water resources held by the people of Montana in
our state Trust lands. We greatly appreciate your continued leadership on these
matters. In that spirit, Montana Trout Unlimited (MTU) writes today to formally
request that you veto recently passed legislation in HB676, Generally Revise State
Land and Water Laws, sponsored by Rep. Brandon Ler (R-Savage). It is our belief
that this legislation fundamentally compromises the fiduciary responsibility to our
state Trust lands and complicates nearly five decades of settled adjudication of
state-based water rights. MTU opposed this legislation throughout the legislative
process, and we appreciated working with Lt. Governor Juras and the Department of
Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) in opposing the bill.
Founded in 1964, Montana Trout Unlimited is the only statewide grassroots
organization dedicated solely to the mission of conserving, protecting, and
restoring Montana’s coldwater fisheries and their watersheds. We carry out
our mission by advocating for stronger policies, education and outreach, and
on-the-ground projects. As the voice for healthy rivers and wild trout, MTU
represents more than 5,000 members and supports in Montana, including
local chapters across the state that prize our rivers, streams, their coldwater
fisheries and recreation opportunities.
As introduced, HB676 had disastrous consequences for the Montana Water Use Act,
the comprehensive statewide water adjudication process, and our state Trust lands.
We recognize that through the legislative process some of the most problematic
sections of the bill were amended out, notably those creating an arbitrary deadline
to the adjudication process and opening decrees up to legal challenges in state
district court from outside partes as well as the forced sale of isolated state Trust
land parcels with appurtenant water rights to lessees. However, the remaining bill,

as amended, still raises significant legal and constitutional issues regarding state
Trust lands as well as threatening to extend the adjudication process by years.
At its core, HB676 violates settled law and raises serious constitutional issues. First,
in its attempt to redefine water rights as improvements, the bill contradicts the
findings in Pettibone v. State (Montana Supreme Court) which held limitations to
what constitutes an improvement on Trust lands to physical infrastructure like
tanks and pipelines rather than water rights themselves. In terms of constitutional
issues, the bill fails to address the Land Board’s constitutional obligation to secure
full market value when appurtenant water rights are separated from Trust Lands. In
doing so, it bypasses the Land Board’s constitutional duty to maximize trust
beneficiaries’ value by preventing compensation for those severed water rights.
Even though the most egregious sections of the bill affecting the statewide
adjudication were removed, the bill still stands to significantly delay the completion
of the adjudication. For one, it would re-open nearly forty years of work by the
Water Court in the process of separating point of diversions from places of use on
settled water rights, meaning more litigation and delays in completing the
adjudication. Further, it complicates settled decrees through those legal processes
since legal rulings against any section may require vacating entire final decrees.
The bill also complicates water use on the ground, meaning that the effective
management and distribution of water would be stymied. Private water rights that
are combining Trust Land and non-Trust Land places of use might face mandatory
place of use removals, reducing legal water volumes to private landowners. Further,
lessees using water on both Trust and private lands could face irrigation restrictions
to comply with those reduced water rights.
For these reasons we respectfully ask you to veto HB676 under the powers granted
to you as Governor of the State of Montana under Article VI, Section 10 of the
Montana Constitution. The legislation stands to significantly affect the people of
Montana and our rich natural resource wealth into the future.
Thank you for considering our request to veto HB676. We appreciate your leadership
and commitment to our state’s public lands and waters. Please do not hesitate to
reach out if you have questions or need additional information

Sincerely,
Clayton R. Elliott
