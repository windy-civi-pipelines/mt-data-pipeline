14 proceedings include all claimants of reserved Indian water rights as necessary and indispensable parties under
15 authority granted the state by 43 U.S.C. 666. However, it is further intended that the state of Montana proceed
16 under the provisions of this part in an effort to conclude compacts for the equitable division and apportionment
17 of waters between the state and its people and the several Indian tribes claiming reserved water rights within
18 the state.
19 (2) To the maximum extent possible, the reserved water rights compact commission established
20 under 2-15-212 should make the negotiation of water rights claimed by the federal government or Indian tribes
21 in or affecting the basins identified by 85-2-218its highest priority. In negotiations, the commission is acting on

3 the written designation from the governing body of a tribe.
4 (2) When the compact commission and the Indian tribes or their authorized representatives have
5 agreed to a compact, they shall sign a copy and file an original copy with the department of state of the United
6 States of America and copies with the secretary of state of Montana and with the governing body for the tribe
7 involved. The compact is effective and binding upon all parties upon ratification by the legislature of Montana
8 and any affected tribal governing body, and approval by the appropriate federal authority.
9 (3) Upon its ratification by the Montana legislature and the tribe, the terms of a compact must be
10 included in the preliminary decree as provided by 85-2-231, and unless an objection to the compact is
11 sustained under 85-2-233, the terms of the compact must be included inthe final decree without alteration.
12 However, if approval of the state legislature and the tribe has not been accomplished by July 1, 2013, all Indian
13 claims for reserved water rights that have not been resolved by a compact must be filed with the department
14 within 24 months. These new filings must be used in the formulation of the preliminary decree and must be

14 proceedings include all claimants of reserved Indian water rights as necessary and indispensable parties under
15 authority granted the state by 43 U.S.C. 666. However, it is further intended that the state of Montana proceed
16 under the provisions of this part in an effort to conclude compacts for the equitable division and apportionment
17 of waters between the state and its people and the several Indian tribes claiming reserved water rights within
18 the state.
19 (2) To the maximum extent possible, the reserved water rights compact commission established
20 under 2-15-212 should make the negotiation of water rights claimed by the federal government or Indian tribes
21 in or affecting the basins identified by 85-2-218its highest priority. In negotiations, the commission is acting on

4 (2) When the compact commission and the Indian tribes or their authorized representatives have
5 agreed to a compact, they shall sign a copy and file an original copy with the department of state of the United
6 States of America and copies with the secretary of state of Montana and with the governing body for the tribe
7 involved. The compact is effective and binding upon all parties upon ratification by the legislature of Montana
8 and any affected tribal governing body, and approval by the appropriate federal authority.
9 (3) Upon its ratification by the Montana legislature and the tribe, the terms of a compact must be
10 included in the preliminary decree as provided by 85-2-231, and unless an objection to the compact is
11 sustained under 85-2-233, the terms of the compact must be included inthe final decree without alteration.
12 However, if approval of the state legislature and the tribe has not been accomplished by July 1, 2013, all Indian
13 claims for reserved water rights that have not been resolved by a compact must be filed with the department
