18 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Terms of wide applicability. (1) Unless the context requires otherwise,
19 the following definitions apply in the Montana Code Annotated:
20 (a) "FATHER" MEANS A MALE PARENT.
21 (B) "Female" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XX
22 chromosomes and produces or would produce relatively large, relatively immobile gametes, or eggs, during her
23 life cycle and has a reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An
24 individual who would otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is female, WHEN
25 USED TO REFER TO A NATURAL PERSON, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NATURALLY HAS, HAD, WILL HAVE, OR WOULD HAVE, BUT
26 FOR A CONGENITAL ANOMALY OR INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL DISRUPTION, THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM THAT AT
27 SOME POINT PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, AND UTILIZES THE LARGE GAMETE, OR OVA, FOR FERTILIZATION.
28 (b)(C) "Male" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XY

1 chromosomes and produces or would produce small, mobile gametes, or sperm, during his life cycle and has a
2 reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An individual who would
3 otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is male, WHEN USED TO REFER TO A
4 NATURAL PERSON, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NATURALLY HAS, HAD, WILL HAVE, OR WOULD HAVE, BUT FOR A CONGENITAL
5 ANOMALY OR INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL DISRUPTION, THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM THAT AT SOME POINT
6 PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, AND UTILIZES THE SMALL GAMETE, OR SPERM, FOR FERTILIZATION.
7 (c)(D) "MAN" MEANS AN ADULT HUMAN MALE, EXCEPT WHEN USED AS A GENERIC REFERENCE TO HUMAN
8 BEINGS.
9 (E) "MOTHER" MEANS A FEMALE PARENT.
10 (F) "Oath" includes an affirmation or declaration.
11 (d)(G) "Person" includes a corporation or other entity as well as a natural person.
12 (e)(H) "Several" means two or more.
13 (f)(I) "Sex" means the organization of the body parts and gametes for reproduction in human beings
14 and other organisms. In human beings, there are exactly two sexes, male and female, with two corresponding
15 types of gametes. The sexes are determined by the biological and genetic indication of male or female,
16 including sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex chromosomes, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and
17 external genitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual's psychological, behavioral, social, chosen, or
18 subjective experience of gender WHETHER SOMEONE IS MALE OR FEMALE, WHICH IS DISTINGUISHED BASED ON THE
19 TYPE OF GAMETE, SPERM OR EGGS, THEY ARE CAPABLE OF OR EXPECTED TO PRODUCE, AS DICTATED BY THEIR PRIMARY
20 SEXUAL ANATOMY. BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY TWO TYPES OF GAMETES, SPERM AND OVA, WITH TWO CORRESPONDING
21 REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS, THERE ARE ONLY TWO SEXES: MALE AND FEMALE. AN INDIVIDUAL'S SEX IS ROOTED IN
22 REPRODUCTIVE ANATOMY AND IS IN NO WAY INFLUENCED OR DEFINED BY ONE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE, BEHAVIOR,
23 EXPRESSION, OR PERSONAL IDENTITY.
24 (g)(J) "State", when applied to the different parts of the United States, includes the District of
25 Columbia and the territories.
26 (h)(K) "United States" includes the District of Columbia and the territories.
27 (L) "WOMAN" MEANS AN ADULT HUMAN FEMALE.
28 (2) Wherever the word "man" or "men" or a word that includes the syllable "man" or "men" in

1 combination with other syllables, such as "workman", appears in this code, the word or syllable includes
2 "woman" or "women" unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intent and unless the subject matter of the
3 statute relates clearly and necessarily to a specific sex only.
4 (3) Whenever the term "heretofore" occurs in any statute, it must be construed to mean any time
5 previous to the day the statute takes effect. Whenever the word "hereafter" occurs, it must be construed to
6 mean the time after the statute containing the term takes effect.
7 (4) (A) THE TERM "GENDER", WHEN USED ALONE TO REFER TO A MALE, FEMALE, OR THE NATURAL
8 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A MALE AND FEMALE:
9 (I) MUST BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM FOR SEX; AND
10 (II) MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM OR SHORT-HAND EXPRESSION FOR GENDER IDENTITY,
11 EXPERIENCED GENDER, GENDER EXPRESSION, OR GENDER ROLE.
12 (B) THE TERM "GENDER" DOES NOT APPLY WHEN IT IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER WORDS OR AS
13 AN ADJECTIVE TO MODIFY OTHER WORDS, OR WHEN CONTEXT OR EXPLICIT DEFINITION IN PREEXISTING STATE LAW,
14 ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, OR GUIDELINES INDICATES OTHERWISE.
15 (C) THE TERM "GENDER IDENTITY", IF USED IN STATE LAW, ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, OR GUIDELINES, MAY
16 NOT BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM OR SUBSTITUTE FOR SEX OR GENDER.

19 the following definitions apply in the Montana Code Annotated:
20 (a) "FATHER" MEANS A MALE PARENT.
21 (B) "Female" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XX
22 chromosomes and produces or would produce relatively large, relatively immobile gametes, or eggs, during her
23 life cycle and has a reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An
24 individual who would otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is female, WHEN
25 USED TO REFER TO A NATURAL PERSON, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NATURALLY HAS, HAD, WILL HAVE, OR WOULD HAVE, BUT
26 FOR A CONGENITAL ANOMALY OR INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL DISRUPTION, THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM THAT AT
27 SOME POINT PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, AND UTILIZES THE LARGE GAMETE, OR OVA, FOR FERTILIZATION.
28 (b)(C) "Male" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XY

1 chromosomes and produces or would produce small, mobile gametes, or sperm, during his life cycle and has a
2 reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An individual who would
3 otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is male, WHEN USED TO REFER TO A
4 NATURAL PERSON, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NATURALLY HAS, HAD, WILL HAVE, OR WOULD HAVE, BUT FOR A CONGENITAL
5 ANOMALY OR INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL DISRUPTION, THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM THAT AT SOME POINT
6 PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, AND UTILIZES THE SMALL GAMETE, OR SPERM, FOR FERTILIZATION.
7 (c)(D) "MAN" MEANS AN ADULT HUMAN MALE, EXCEPT WHEN USED AS A GENERIC REFERENCE TO HUMAN
8 BEINGS.
9 (E) "MOTHER" MEANS A FEMALE PARENT.

12 (e)(H) "Several" means two or more.
13 (f)(I) "Sex" means the organization of the body parts and gametes for reproduction in human beings
14 and other organisms. In human beings, there are exactly two sexes, male and female, with two corresponding
15 types of gametes. The sexes are determined by the biological and genetic indication of male or female,
16 including sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex chromosomes, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and
17 external genitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual's psychological, behavioral, social, chosen, or
18 subjective experience of gender WHETHER SOMEONE IS MALE OR FEMALE, WHICH IS DISTINGUISHED BASED ON THE
19 TYPE OF GAMETE, SPERM OR EGGS, THEY ARE CAPABLE OF OR EXPECTED TO PRODUCE, AS DICTATED BY THEIR PRIMARY
20 SEXUAL ANATOMY. BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY TWO TYPES OF GAMETES, SPERM AND OVA, WITH TWO CORRESPONDING
21 REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS, THERE ARE ONLY TWO SEXES: MALE AND FEMALE. AN INDIVIDUAL'S SEX IS ROOTED IN
22 REPRODUCTIVE ANATOMY AND IS IN NO WAY INFLUENCED OR DEFINED BY ONE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE, BEHAVIOR,
23 EXPRESSION, OR PERSONAL IDENTITY.
24 (g)(J) "State", when applied to the different parts of the United States, includes the District of
25 Columbia and the territories.
26 (h)(K) "United States" includes the District of Columbia and the territories.
27 (L) "WOMAN" MEANS AN ADULT HUMAN FEMALE.

1 combination with other syllables, such as "workman", appears in this code, the word or syllable includes
2 "woman" or "women" unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intent and unless the subject matter of the
3 statute relates clearly and necessarily to a specific sex only.
4 (3) Whenever the term "heretofore" occurs in any statute, it must be construed to mean any time
5 previous to the day the statute takes effect. Whenever the word "hereafter" occurs, it must be construed to
6 mean the time after the statute containing the term takes effect.
7 (4) (A) THE TERM "GENDER", WHEN USED ALONE TO REFER TO A MALE, FEMALE, OR THE NATURAL
8 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A MALE AND FEMALE:
9 (I) MUST BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM FOR SEX; AND
10 (II) MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM OR SHORT-HAND EXPRESSION FOR GENDER IDENTITY,
11 EXPERIENCED GENDER, GENDER EXPRESSION, OR GENDER ROLE.
12 (B) THE TERM "GENDER" DOES NOT APPLY WHEN IT IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER WORDS OR AS
13 AN ADJECTIVE TO MODIFY OTHER WORDS, OR WHEN CONTEXT OR EXPLICIT DEFINITION IN PREEXISTING STATE LAW,
14 ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, OR GUIDELINES INDICATES OTHERWISE.
15 (C) THE TERM "GENDER IDENTITY", IF USED IN STATE LAW, ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, OR GUIDELINES, MAY
16 NOT BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM OR SUBSTITUTE FOR SEX OR GENDER.
