21 WHEREAS, in human beings, there are two -- and only two -- sexes: male and female, which refer to

1 truth and its relationship to concepts and terms including but not limited to sex assigned at birth, gender, gender
2 identity, gender role, gender expression, and experienced gender; and
3 WHEREAS, confusion and ambiguities surrounding the definitions of sex, male, female, and related
4 terms can hinder individual efforts to enjoy equal treatment under the law; and
5 WHEREAS, legal equality of the two sexes -- male and female -- does not imply that the sexes are
6 identical to each other or are the same in every respect; and
7 WHEREAS, with respect to the two sexes -- male and female -- separate facilities or sports leagues
8 established because of or organized according to physical differences between the sexes do not constitute
9 unequal treatment under the law; and
10 WHEREAS, physical differences between males and females are enduring, and the two sexes are not
11 fungible.
12 THEREFORE, it is the intent of the Legislature of this state to clarify and reconcile the meaning of sex,
13 male, female, and related terms in state laws, administrative rules, and guidelines.
14
15 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
16
17 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Terms of wide applicability. (1) Unless the context requires otherwise,
18 the following definitions apply in the Montana Code Annotated:
19 (a) "Father" means a male parent.
20 (b) "Female" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XX
21 chromosomes and produces or would produce relatively large, relatively immobile gametes, or eggs, during her
22 life cycle and has a reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An
23 individual who would otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is female, when
24 used to refer to a natural person, an individual who naturally has, had, will have, or would have, but for a
25 congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive system that at some point
26 produces, transports, and utilizes the large gamete, or ova, for fertilization.
27 (b)(c) "Male" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XY
28 chromosomes and produces or would produce small, mobile gametes, or sperm, during his life cycle and has a

1 reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An individual who would
2 otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is male, when used to refer to a
3 natural person, an individual who naturally has, had, will have, or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or
4 intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive system that at some point produces, transports, and
5 utilizes the small gamete, or sperm, for fertilization.
6 (c)(d) "Man" means an adult human male, except when used as a generic reference to human
7 beings.
8 (e) "Mother" means a female parent.
9 (f) "Oath" includes an affirmation or declaration.
10 (d)(g) "Person" includes a corporation or other entity as well as a natural person.
11 (e)(h) "Several" means two or more.
12 (f)(i) "Sex" means the organization of the body parts and gametes for reproduction in human beings
13 and other organisms. In human beings, there are exactly two sexes, male and female, with two corresponding
14 types of gametes. The sexes are determined by the biological and genetic indication of male or female,
15 including sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex chromosomes, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and
16 external genitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual's psychological, behavioral, social, chosen, or
17 subjective experience of gender whether someone is male or female, which is distinguished based on the type
18 of gamete, sperm or eggs, they are capable of or expected to produce, as dictated by their primary sexual
19 anatomy. Because there are only two types of gametes, sperm and ova, with two corresponding reproductive
20 systems, there are only two sexes: male and female. An individual's sex is rooted in reproductive anatomy and
21 is in no way influenced or defined by one's psychological state, behavior, expression, or personal identity.
22 (g)(j) "State", when applied to the different parts of the United States, includes the District of
23 Columbia and the territories.
24 (h)(k) "United States" includes the District of Columbia and the territories.
25 (l) "Woman" means an adult human female.
26 (2) Wherever the word "man" or "men" or a word that includes the syllable "man" or "men" in
27 combination with other syllables, such as "workman", appears in this code, the word or syllable includes
28 "woman" or "women" unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intent and unless the subject matter of the

1 statute relates clearly and necessarily to a specific sex only.
2 (3) Whenever the term "heretofore" occurs in any statute, it must be construed to mean any time
3 previous to the day the statute takes effect. Whenever the word "hereafter" occurs, it must be construed to
4 mean the time after the statute containing the term takes effect.
5 (4) (a) The term "gender", when used alone to refer to a male, female, or the natural differences
6 between a male and female:
7 (i) must be considered a synonym for sex; and
8 (ii) may not be considered a synonym or short-hand expression for gender identity, experienced
9 gender, gender expression, or gender role.
10 (b) The term "gender" does not apply when it is used in conjunction with other words or as an
11 adjective to modify other words, or when context or explicit definition in preexisting state law, administrative
12 rules, or guidelines indicates otherwise.
13 (c) The term "gender identity", if used in state law, administrative rules, or guidelines, may not be
14 considered a synonym or substitute for sex or gender.

20 (1) eliminating, in the classification of positions, the use of judgments and factors that contain
21 inherent biases based on sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1]; and
22 (2) comparing, in the classification of positions, the factors for determining job worth across

16 prevent the board of trustees of such hospital district from establishing reasonable minimum rates for hospital
17 quarters, services, and supplies. Indigents needing such services, for the rendition of which provision is made
18 by the laws of Montana, must be admitted to such public hospitals on terms and rates prescribed or authorized

21 Therefore:
22 I will conduct my campaign in the best American tradition, discussing the issues as I see them,
23 presenting my record and policies with sincerity and frankness, and criticizing without fear or favor the record

26 electoral process.
27 I will conduct my campaign without the use of personal vilification, character defamation, whispering
28 campaigns, libel, slander, or scurrilous attacks on my opposition or my opposition's personal or family life.

3 as to the loyalty and patriotism of my opposition.
4 I will not make any appeal to prejudice based on race, sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1], creed, or

18 electronically transfer to the federally designated organ procurement organization all information that appears
19 on the front of a driver's license, including the name, gender, as provided in [section 1], date of birth, and most
20 recent address of any person who obtains a driver's license and who volunteers to donate organs or tissue

22 information, as provided in subsection (5). However, all subsequent electronic transfers of donor information
23 must be at no charge to the federally designated organ procurement organization.
24 (2) Information obtained by the federally designated organ procurement organization must be used
25 for the purpose of establishing a statewide organ and tissue donation registry accessible to in-state, recognized
26 cadaveric organ and cadaveric tissue agencies for the recovery or placement of organs and tissue and to
27 procurement agencies in another state when a Montana resident is a donor of an anatomical gift and is not
28 located in the state at the time of death or immediately before the death of the donor.

1 (3) An organ or tissue donation organization may not obtain information from the organ and tissue
2 donation registry for the purpose of fundraising. Organ and tissue donation registry information may not be
3 further disseminated unless authorized in this section or by federal law. Dissemination of organ and tissue
4 donation registry information may be made by the organ procurement organization to a recognized, in-state
5 procurement agency for other tissue recovery or to an out-of-state, federally designated organ procurement
6 organization.
7 (4) The federally designated organ procurement organization may acquire donor information from
8 sources other than the department of justice.
9 (5) All reasonable costs associated with the creation and maintenance of the organ and tissue
10 donation registry, as determined by the department of justice, must be paid by the organ and tissue
11 procurement organizations. Any money collected by the department of justice must be deposited in an account
12 in the state special revenue fund established by the department of justice for the purpose of the payment of
13 reasonable costs associated with the development and maintenance of the organ and tissue donation registry
14 and necessary for the initial installation and setup for electronic transfer of the donor information.
15 (6) An individual does not need to participate in the organ and tissue donation registry to be a
16 donor of organs or tissue. The registry is intended to facilitate organ and tissue donation and not inhibit persons
17 from being donors upon death."
