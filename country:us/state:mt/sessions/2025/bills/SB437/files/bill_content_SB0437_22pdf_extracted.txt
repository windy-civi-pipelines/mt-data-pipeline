21 WHEREAS, in human beings, there are two -- and only two -- sexes: male and female, which refer to
22 the two body structures (phenotypes) that, in normal development, correspond to one or the other gamete --
23 sperm for males and ova for females; and
24 WHEREAS, every individual is either male or female; and
25 WHEREAS, an individual's sex can be observed or clinically verified at or before birth; and
26 WHEREAS, rare disorders of sexual development are not exceptions to the binary nature of sex; and
27
28 WHEREAS, in no case is an individual's sex determined by stipulation or self-identification; and

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0437.2
1 WHEREAS, there is increasing confusion about the definition and implications of sex as a biological
2 truth and its relationship to concepts and terms including but not limited to sex assigned at birth, gender, gender
3 identity, gender role, gender expression, and experienced gender; and
4 WHEREAS, confusion and ambiguities surrounding the definitions of sex, male, female, and related
5 terms can hinder individual efforts to enjoy equal treatment under the law; and
6 WHEREAS, legal equality of the two sexes -- male and female -- does not imply that the sexes are
7 identical to each other or are the same in every respect; and
8 WHEREAS, with respect to the two sexes -- male and female -- separate facilities or sports leagues
9 established because of or organized according to physical differences between the sexes do not constitute
10 unequal treatment under the law; and
11 WHEREAS, physical differences between males and females are enduring, and the two sexes are not
12 fungible.
13 THEREFORE, it is the intent of the Legislature of this state to clarify and reconcile the meaning of sex,
14 male, female, and related terms in state laws, administrative rules, and guidelines.
15
16 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
17
18 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Terms of wide applicability. (1) Unless the context requires otherwise,
19 the following definitions apply in the Montana Code Annotated:
20 (a) "FATHER" MEANS A MALE PARENT.
21 (B) "Female" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XX
22 chromosomes and produces or would produce relatively large, relatively immobile gametes, or eggs, during her
23 life cycle and has a reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An
24 individual who would otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is female, WHEN
25 USED TO REFER TO A NATURAL PERSON, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NATURALLY HAS, HAD, WILL HAVE, OR WOULD HAVE, BUT
26 FOR A CONGENITAL ANOMALY OR INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL DISRUPTION, THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM THAT AT
27 SOME POINT PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, AND UTILIZES THE LARGE GAMETE, OR OVA, FOR FERTILIZATION.
28 (b) (C) "Male" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XY
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0437.2
1 chromosomes and produces or would produce small, mobile gametes, or sperm, during his life cycle and has a
2 reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An individual who would
3 otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is male, WHEN USED TO REFER TO A
4 NATURAL PERSON, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NATURALLY HAS, HAD, WILL HAVE, OR WOULD HAVE, BUT FOR A CONGENITAL
5 ANOMALY OR INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL DISRUPTION, THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM THAT AT SOME POINT
6 PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, AND UTILIZES THE SMALL GAMETE, OR SPERM, FOR FERTILIZATION.
7 (c) (D) "MAN" MEANS AN ADULT HUMAN MALE, EXCEPT WHEN USED AS A GENERIC REFERENCE TO HUMAN
8 BEINGS.
9 (E) "MOTHER" MEANS A FEMALE PARENT.
10 (F) "Oath" includes an affirmation or declaration.
11 (d) (G) "Person" includes a corporation or other entity as well as a natural person.
12 (e) (H) "Several" means two or more.
13 (f) (I) "Sex" means the organization of the body parts and gametes for reproduction in human beings
14 and other organisms. In human beings, there are exactly two sexes, male and female, with two corresponding
15 types of gametes. The sexes are determined by the biological and genetic indication of male or female,
16 including sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex chromosomes, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and
17 external genitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual's psychological, behavioral, social, chosen, or
18 subjective experience of gender WHETHER SOMEONE IS MALE OR FEMALE, WHICH IS DISTINGUISHED BASED ON THE
19 TYPE OF GAMETE, SPERM OR EGGS, THEY ARE CAPABLE OF OR EXPECTED TO PRODUCE, AS DICTATED BY THEIR PRIMARY
20 SEXUAL ANATOMY. BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY TWO TYPES OF GAMETES, SPERM AND OVA, WITH TWO CORRESPONDING
21 REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS, THERE ARE ONLY TWO SEXES: MALE AND FEMALE. AN INDIVIDUAL'S SEX IS ROOTED IN
22 REPRODUCTIVE ANATOMY AND IS IN NO WAY INFLUENCED OR DEFINED BY ONE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE, BEHAVIOR,
23 EXPRESSION, OR PERSONAL IDENTITY.
24 (g) (J) "State", when applied to the different parts of the United States, includes the District of
25 Columbia and the territories.
26 (h) (K) "United States" includes the District of Columbia and the territories.
27 (L) "WOMAN" MEANS AN ADULT HUMAN FEMALE.
28 (2) Wherever the word "man" or "men" or a word that includes the syllable "man" or "men" in
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0437.2
1 combination with other syllables, such as "workman", appears in this code, the word or syllable includes
2 "woman" or "women" unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intent and unless the subject matter of the
3 statute relates clearly and necessarily to a specific sex only.
4 (3) Whenever the term "heretofore" occurs in any statute, it must be construed to mean any time
5 previous to the day the statute takes effect. Whenever the word "hereafter" occurs, it must be construed to
6 mean the time after the statute containing the term takes effect.
7 (4) (A) THE TERM "GENDER", WHEN USED ALONE TO REFER TO A MALE, FEMALE, OR THE NATURAL
8 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A MALE AND FEMALE:
9 (I) MUST BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM FOR SEX; AND
10 (II) MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM OR SHORT-HAND EXPRESSION FOR GENDER IDENTITY,
11 EXPERIENCED GENDER, GENDER EXPRESSION, OR GENDER ROLE.
12 (B) THE TERM "GENDER" DOES NOT APPLY WHEN IT IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER WORDS OR AS
13 AN ADJECTIVE TO MODIFY OTHER WORDS, OR WHEN CONTEXT OR EXPLICIT DEFINITION IN PREEXISTING STATE LAW,
14 ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, OR GUIDELINES INDICATES OTHERWISE.
15 (C) THE TERM "GENDER IDENTITY", IF USED IN STATE LAW, ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, OR GUIDELINES, MAY
16 NOT BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM OR SUBSTITUTE FOR SEX OR GENDER.

18 prevent the board of trustees of such hospital district from establishing reasonable minimum rates for hospital

21 fairly conducted campaigns, our citizens may exercise their constitutional right to a free and untrammeled
22 choice and the will of the people may be fully and clearly expressed on the issues before the country.
23 Therefore:
24 I will conduct my campaign in the best American tradition, discussing the issues as I see them,
25 presenting my record and policies with sincerity and frankness, and criticizing without fear or favor the record
26 and policies of my opponent and my opponent's party that merit such criticism.
27 I will defend and uphold the right of every qualified American voter to full and equal participation in the

2 campaigns, libel, slander, or scurrilous attacks on my opposition or my opposition's personal or family life.
3 I will not use campaign material of any sort that misrepresents, distorts, or otherwise falsifies the facts,
4 nor will I use malicious or unfounded accusations that aim at creating or exploiting doubts, without justification,
5 as to the loyalty and patriotism of my opposition.
6 I will not make any appeal to prejudice based on race, sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1], creed, or
7 national origin.
8 I will not undertake or condone any dishonest or unethical practice that tends to corrupt or undermine
9 our American system of free elections or that hampers or prevents the full and free expression of the will of the
10 voters.
11 Insofar as is possible, I will immediately and publicly repudiate support deriving from any individual or
12 group that resorts, on behalf of my candidacy or in opposition to that of my opponent, to the methods and

21 WHEREAS, in human beings, there are two -- and only two -- sexes: male and female, which refer to
22 the two body structures (phenotypes) that, in normal development, correspond to one or the other gamete --
23 sperm for males and ova for females; and
24 WHEREAS, every individual is either male or female; and
25 WHEREAS, an individual's sex can be observed or clinically verified at or before birth; and
26 WHEREAS, rare disorders of sexual development are not exceptions to the binary nature of sex; and
27
28 WHEREAS, in no case is an individual's sex determined by stipulation or self-identification; and
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0437.2
1 WHEREAS, there is increasing confusion about the definition and implications of sex as a biological
2 truth and its relationship to concepts and terms including but not limited to sex assigned at birth, gender, gender
3 identity, gender role, gender expression, and experienced gender; and
4 WHEREAS, confusion and ambiguities surrounding the definitions of sex, male, female, and related
5 terms can hinder individual efforts to enjoy equal treatment under the law; and
6 WHEREAS, legal equality of the two sexes -- male and female -- does not imply that the sexes are
7 identical to each other or are the same in every respect; and
8 WHEREAS, with respect to the two sexes -- male and female -- separate facilities or sports leagues
9 established because of or organized according to physical differences between the sexes do not constitute
10 unequal treatment under the law; and
11 WHEREAS, physical differences between males and females are enduring, and the two sexes are not
12 fungible.
13 THEREFORE, it is the intent of the Legislature of this state to clarify and reconcile the meaning of sex,
14 male, female, and related terms in state laws, administrative rules, and guidelines.
15
16 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
17
18 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Terms of wide applicability. (1) Unless the context requires otherwise,
19 the following definitions apply in the Montana Code Annotated:
20 (a) "FATHER" MEANS A MALE PARENT.
21 (B) "Female" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XX
22 chromosomes and produces or would produce relatively large, relatively immobile gametes, or eggs, during her
23 life cycle and has a reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An
24 individual who would otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is female, WHEN
25 USED TO REFER TO A NATURAL PERSON, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NATURALLY HAS, HAD, WILL HAVE, OR WOULD HAVE, BUT
26 FOR A CONGENITAL ANOMALY OR INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL DISRUPTION, THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM THAT AT
27 SOME POINT PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, AND UTILIZES THE LARGE GAMETE, OR OVA, FOR FERTILIZATION.
28 (b) (C) "Male" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XY
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0437.2
1 chromosomes and produces or would produce small, mobile gametes, or sperm, during his life cycle and has a
2 reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An individual who would
3 otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is male, WHEN USED TO REFER TO A
4 NATURAL PERSON, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NATURALLY HAS, HAD, WILL HAVE, OR WOULD HAVE, BUT FOR A CONGENITAL
5 ANOMALY OR INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL DISRUPTION, THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM THAT AT SOME POINT
6 PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, AND UTILIZES THE SMALL GAMETE, OR SPERM, FOR FERTILIZATION.
7 (c) (D) "MAN" MEANS AN ADULT HUMAN MALE, EXCEPT WHEN USED AS A GENERIC REFERENCE TO HUMAN
8 BEINGS.
9 (E) "MOTHER" MEANS A FEMALE PARENT.
10 (F) "Oath" includes an affirmation or declaration.
11 (d) (G) "Person" includes a corporation or other entity as well as a natural person.
12 (e) (H) "Several" means two or more.
13 (f) (I) "Sex" means the organization of the body parts and gametes for reproduction in human beings
14 and other organisms. In human beings, there are exactly two sexes, male and female, with two corresponding
15 types of gametes. The sexes are determined by the biological and genetic indication of male or female,
16 including sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex chromosomes, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and
17 external genitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual's psychological, behavioral, social, chosen, or
18 subjective experience of gender WHETHER SOMEONE IS MALE OR FEMALE, WHICH IS DISTINGUISHED BASED ON THE
19 TYPE OF GAMETE, SPERM OR EGGS, THEY ARE CAPABLE OF OR EXPECTED TO PRODUCE, AS DICTATED BY THEIR PRIMARY
20 SEXUAL ANATOMY. BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY TWO TYPES OF GAMETES, SPERM AND OVA, WITH TWO CORRESPONDING
21 REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS, THERE ARE ONLY TWO SEXES: MALE AND FEMALE. AN INDIVIDUAL'S SEX IS ROOTED IN
22 REPRODUCTIVE ANATOMY AND IS IN NO WAY INFLUENCED OR DEFINED BY ONE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE, BEHAVIOR,
23 EXPRESSION, OR PERSONAL IDENTITY.
24 (g) (J) "State", when applied to the different parts of the United States, includes the District of
25 Columbia and the territories.
26 (h) (K) "United States" includes the District of Columbia and the territories.
27 (L) "WOMAN" MEANS AN ADULT HUMAN FEMALE.
28 (2) Wherever the word "man" or "men" or a word that includes the syllable "man" or "men" in
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0437.2
1 combination with other syllables, such as "workman", appears in this code, the word or syllable includes
2 "woman" or "women" unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intent and unless the subject matter of the
3 statute relates clearly and necessarily to a specific sex only.
4 (3) Whenever the term "heretofore" occurs in any statute, it must be construed to mean any time
5 previous to the day the statute takes effect. Whenever the word "hereafter" occurs, it must be construed to
6 mean the time after the statute containing the term takes effect.
7 (4) (A) THE TERM "GENDER", WHEN USED ALONE TO REFER TO A MALE, FEMALE, OR THE NATURAL
8 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A MALE AND FEMALE:
9 (I) MUST BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM FOR SEX; AND
10 (II) MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM OR SHORT-HAND EXPRESSION FOR GENDER IDENTITY,
11 EXPERIENCED GENDER, GENDER EXPRESSION, OR GENDER ROLE.
12 (B) THE TERM "GENDER" DOES NOT APPLY WHEN IT IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER WORDS OR AS
13 AN ADJECTIVE TO MODIFY OTHER WORDS, OR WHEN CONTEXT OR EXPLICIT DEFINITION IN PREEXISTING STATE LAW,
14 ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, OR GUIDELINES INDICATES OTHERWISE.
15 (C) THE TERM "GENDER IDENTITY", IF USED IN STATE LAW, ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, OR GUIDELINES, MAY
16 NOT BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM OR SUBSTITUTE FOR SEX OR GENDER.
17
18 Section 2. Section 2-18-208, MCA, is amended to read:
19 "2-18-208. Comparable worth. The department of administration shall, in its continuous efforts to
20 enhance the current classification plan and pay schedules, work toward the goal of establishing a standard of
21 equal pay for comparable worth. This standard for the classification plan shall be reached by:
22 (1) eliminating, in the classification of positions, the use of judgments and factors that contain
23 inherent biases based on sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1]; and
24 (2) comparing, in the classification of positions, the factors for determining job worth across
25 occupational groups whenever those groups are dominated by males or females."
26
27 SECTION 3. Section 2-18-606, MCA, is amended to read:
28 "2-18-606. Parental leave for state employees. (1) The department of administration shall develop a
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0437.2
1 parental leave policy for permanent state employees. The policy must permit an employee to take a reasonable
2 leave of absence and permit the employee to use sick leave immediately following the birth or placement of a
3 child for a period not to exceed 15 working days if:
4 (a) the employee is adopting a child; or
5 (b) the employee is a birth father, as defined in [section 1].
6 (2) As used in this section, "placement" means placement for adoption as defined in 33-22-130.
7 (3) A state agency that is not subject to the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act of
8 1993, 29 U.S.C. 2601 through 2654, may extend the provisions of that act to the employees of the agency."
9
10 Section 4. Section 7-15-4207, MCA, is amended to read:
11 "7-15-4207. Prohibition against discrimination. For all of the purposes of this part and part 43, a
12 person may not be subjected to discrimination because of sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1], race, creed,
13 religion, age, physical or mental disability, color, or national origin."
14
15 Section 5. Section 7-34-2123, MCA, is amended to read:
16 "7-34-2123. Admission to district hospital facilities. Such a hospital district must admit persons to
17 its facilities without regard to race, color, or sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1]. Such obligation shall not
18 prevent the board of trustees of such hospital district from establishing reasonable minimum rates for hospital
19 quarters, services, and supplies. Indigents needing such services, for the rendition of which provision is made
20 by the laws of Montana, must be admitted to such public hospitals on terms and rates prescribed or authorized
21 by law."
22
23 SECTION 6. Section 10-2-403, MCA, is amended to read:
24 "10-2-403. Eligibility for residence in home. To be eligible for residence in a Montana veterans'
25 home under rules prescribed by the department of public health and human services, a person must be a
26 veteran or the spouse or surviving spouse of a veteran. Consideration must also be given to:

25 presenting my record and policies with sincerity and frankness, and criticizing without fear or favor the record
26 and policies of my opponent and my opponent's party that merit such criticism.

3 I will not use campaign material of any sort that misrepresents, distorts, or otherwise falsifies the facts,
4 nor will I use malicious or unfounded accusations that aim at creating or exploiting doubts, without justification,
5 as to the loyalty and patriotism of my opposition.
6 I will not make any appeal to prejudice based on race, sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1], creed, or
7 national origin.
8 I will not undertake or condone any dishonest or unethical practice that tends to corrupt or undermine
9 our American system of free elections or that hampers or prevents the full and free expression of the will of the
10 voters.
11 Insofar as is possible, I will immediately and publicly repudiate support deriving from any individual or
