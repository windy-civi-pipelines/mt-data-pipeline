Section 2:
SECTION 1-1-201, MCA; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE.
WHEREAS, in human beings, there are two -- and only two -- sexes: male and female, which refer to
the two body structures (phenotypes) that, in normal development, correspond to one or the other gamete --
sperm for males and ova for females; and
WHEREAS, every individual is either male or female; and
WHEREAS, an individual's sex can be observed or clinically verified at or before birth; and
WHEREAS, rare disorders of sexual development are not exceptions to the binary nature of sex; and
WHEREAS, in no case is an individual's sex determined by stipulation or self-identification; and
WHEREAS, there is increasing confusion about the definition and implications of sex as a biological
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 437
truth and its relationship to concepts and terms including but not limited to sex assigned at birth, gender, gender
identity, gender role, gender expression, and experienced gender; and
WHEREAS, confusion and ambiguities surrounding the definitions of sex, male, female, and related
terms can hinder individual efforts to enjoy equal treatment under the law; and
WHEREAS, legal equality of the two sexes -- male and female -- does not imply that the sexes are
identical to each other or are the same in every respect; and
WHEREAS, with respect to the two sexes -- male and female -- separate facilities or sports leagues
established because of or organized according to physical differences between the sexes do not constitute
unequal treatment under the law; and
WHEREAS, physical differences between males and females are enduring, and the two sexes are not
fungible.
THEREFORE, it is the intent of the Legislature of this state to clarify and reconcile the meaning of sex,
male, female, and related terms in state laws, administrative rules, and guidelines.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:

Section 3:
Section 1. Terms of wide applicability. (1) Unless the context requires otherwise, the following
definitions apply in the Montana Code Annotated:
(a) "Father" means a male parent.
(b) "Female" means, when used to refer to a natural person, an individual who naturally has, had,
will have, or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive
system that at some point produces, transports, and utilizes the large gamete, or ova, for fertilization.
(c) "Male" means, when used to refer to a natural person, an individual who naturally has, had, will
have, or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive
system that at some point produces, transports, and utilizes the small gamete, or sperm, for fertilization.
(d) "Man" means an adult human male, except when used as a generic reference to human
beings.
(e) "Mother" means a female parent.
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 437
(f) "Oath" includes an affirmation or declaration.
(g) "Person" includes a corporation or other entity as well as a natural person.
(h) "Several" means two or more.
(i) "Sex" means whether someone is male or female, which is distinguished based on the type of
gamete, sperm or eggs, they are capable of or expected to produce, as dictated by their primary sexual
anatomy. Because there are only two types of gametes, sperm and ova, with two corresponding reproductive
systems, there are only two sexes: male and female. An individual's sex is rooted in reproductive anatomy and
is in no way influenced or defined by one's psychological state, behavior, expression, or personal identity.
(j) "State", when applied to the different parts of the United States, includes the District of
Columbia and the territories.
(k) "United States" includes the District of Columbia and the territories.
(l) "Woman" means an adult human female.
(2) Wherever the word "man" or "men" or a word that includes the syllable "man" or "men" in
combination with other syllables, such as "workman", appears in this code, the word or syllable includes
"woman" or "women" unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intent and unless the subject matter of the
statute relates clearly and necessarily to a specific sex only.
(3) Whenever the term "heretofore" occurs in any statute, it must be construed to mean any time
previous to the day the statute takes effect. Whenever the word "hereafter" occurs, it must be construed to
mean the time after the statute containing the term takes effect.
(4) (a) The term "gender", when used alone to refer to a male, female, or the natural differences
between a male and female:
(i) must be considered a synonym for sex; and
(ii) may not be considered a synonym or short-hand expression for gender identity, experienced
gender, gender expression, or gender role.
(b) The term "gender" does not apply when it is used in conjunction with other words or as an
adjective to modify other words, or when context or explicit definition in preexisting state law, administrative
rules, or guidelines indicates otherwise.
(c) The term "gender identity", if used in state law, administrative rules, or guidelines, may not be
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 437

libelous, or defamatory matter; any language that in any way incites, counsels, promotes, or advocates hatred,
abuse, violence, or hostility toward, or that tends to cast ridicule or shame upon, a group of persons by reason

"13-35-301. Adoption of code of fair campaign practices. The following code of fair campaign

"There are basic principles of decency, honesty, and fair play that every candidate for public office in
the United States has a moral obligation to observe and uphold, in order that, after vigorously contested but
fairly conducted campaigns, our citizens may exercise their constitutional right to a free and untrammeled
choice and the will of the people may be fully and clearly expressed on the issues before the country.
Therefore:
I will conduct my campaign in the best American tradition, discussing the issues as I see them,
presenting my record and policies with sincerity and frankness, and criticizing without fear or favor the record
and policies of my opponent and my opponent's party that merit such criticism.
I will defend and uphold the right of every qualified American voter to full and equal participation in the
electoral process.
I will conduct my campaign without the use of personal vilification, character defamation, whispering
campaigns, libel, slander, or scurrilous attacks on my opposition or my opposition's personal or family life.
I will not use campaign material of any sort that misrepresents, distorts, or otherwise falsifies the facts,
nor will I use malicious or unfounded accusations that aim at creating or exploiting doubts, without justification,
as to the loyalty and patriotism of my opposition.
I will not make any appeal to prejudice based on race, sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1], creed, or
national origin.
I will not undertake or condone any dishonest or unethical practice that tends to corrupt or undermine
our American system of free elections or that hampers or prevents the full and free expression of the will of the
voters.
Insofar as is possible, I will immediately and publicly repudiate support deriving from any individual or
group that resorts, on behalf of my candidacy or in opposition to that of my opponent, to the methods and
tactics that I have pledged not to use or condone.""

SECTION 1-1-201, MCA; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE.
WHEREAS, in human beings, there are two -- and only two -- sexes: male and female, which refer to
the two body structures (phenotypes) that, in normal development, correspond to one or the other gamete --
sperm for males and ova for females; and
WHEREAS, every individual is either male or female; and
WHEREAS, an individual's sex can be observed or clinically verified at or before birth; and
WHEREAS, rare disorders of sexual development are not exceptions to the binary nature of sex; and
WHEREAS, in no case is an individual's sex determined by stipulation or self-identification; and
WHEREAS, there is increasing confusion about the definition and implications of sex as a biological

ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 437
truth and its relationship to concepts and terms including but not limited to sex assigned at birth, gender, gender
identity, gender role, gender expression, and experienced gender; and
WHEREAS, confusion and ambiguities surrounding the definitions of sex, male, female, and related
terms can hinder individual efforts to enjoy equal treatment under the law; and
WHEREAS, legal equality of the two sexes -- male and female -- does not imply that the sexes are
identical to each other or are the same in every respect; and
WHEREAS, with respect to the two sexes -- male and female -- separate facilities or sports leagues
established because of or organized according to physical differences between the sexes do not constitute
unequal treatment under the law; and
WHEREAS, physical differences between males and females are enduring, and the two sexes are not
fungible.
THEREFORE, it is the intent of the Legislature of this state to clarify and reconcile the meaning of sex,
male, female, and related terms in state laws, administrative rules, and guidelines.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
Section 1. Terms of wide applicability. (1) Unless the context requires otherwise, the following
definitions apply in the Montana Code Annotated:
(a) "Father" means a male parent.
(b) "Female" means, when used to refer to a natural person, an individual who naturally has, had,
will have, or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive
system that at some point produces, transports, and utilizes the large gamete, or ova, for fertilization.
(c) "Male" means, when used to refer to a natural person, an individual who naturally has, had, will
have, or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive
system that at some point produces, transports, and utilizes the small gamete, or sperm, for fertilization.
(d) "Man" means an adult human male, except when used as a generic reference to human
beings.
(e) "Mother" means a female parent.
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 437
(f) "Oath" includes an affirmation or declaration.
(g) "Person" includes a corporation or other entity as well as a natural person.
(h) "Several" means two or more.
(i) "Sex" means whether someone is male or female, which is distinguished based on the type of
gamete, sperm or eggs, they are capable of or expected to produce, as dictated by their primary sexual
anatomy. Because there are only two types of gametes, sperm and ova, with two corresponding reproductive
systems, there are only two sexes: male and female. An individual's sex is rooted in reproductive anatomy and
is in no way influenced or defined by one's psychological state, behavior, expression, or personal identity.
(j) "State", when applied to the different parts of the United States, includes the District of
Columbia and the territories.
(k) "United States" includes the District of Columbia and the territories.
(l) "Woman" means an adult human female.
(2) Wherever the word "man" or "men" or a word that includes the syllable "man" or "men" in
combination with other syllables, such as "workman", appears in this code, the word or syllable includes
"woman" or "women" unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intent and unless the subject matter of the
statute relates clearly and necessarily to a specific sex only.
(3) Whenever the term "heretofore" occurs in any statute, it must be construed to mean any time
previous to the day the statute takes effect. Whenever the word "hereafter" occurs, it must be construed to
mean the time after the statute containing the term takes effect.
(4) (a) The term "gender", when used alone to refer to a male, female, or the natural differences
between a male and female:
(i) must be considered a synonym for sex; and
(ii) may not be considered a synonym or short-hand expression for gender identity, experienced
gender, gender expression, or gender role.
(b) The term "gender" does not apply when it is used in conjunction with other words or as an
adjective to modify other words, or when context or explicit definition in preexisting state law, administrative
rules, or guidelines indicates otherwise.
(c) The term "gender identity", if used in state law, administrative rules, or guidelines, may not be
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 437
considered a synonym or substitute for sex or gender.
Section 2. Section 2-18-208, MCA, is amended to read:
"2-18-208. Comparable worth. The department of administration shall, in its continuous efforts to
enhance the current classification plan and pay schedules, work toward the goal of establishing a standard of
equal pay for comparable worth. This standard for the classification plan shall be reached by:
(1) eliminating, in the classification of positions, the use of judgments and factors that contain
inherent biases based on sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1]; and
(2) comparing, in the classification of positions, the factors for determining job worth across
occupational groups whenever those groups are dominated by males or females."
Section 3. Section 2-18-606, MCA, is amended to read:
"2-18-606. Parental leave for state employees. (1) The department of administration shall develop a
parental leave policy for permanent state employees. The policy must permit an employee to take a reasonable
leave of absence and permit the employee to use sick leave immediately following the birth or placement of a
child for a period not to exceed 15 working days if:
(a) the employee is adopting a child; or
(b) the employee is a birth father, as defined in [section 1].
(2) As used in this section, "placement" means placement for adoption as defined in 33-22-130.
(3) A state agency that is not subject to the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act of
1993, 29 U.S.C. 2601 through 2654, may extend the provisions of that act to the employees of the agency."
Section 4. Section 7-15-4207, MCA, is amended to read:
"7-15-4207. Prohibition against discrimination. For all of the purposes of this part and part 43, a
person may not be subjected to discrimination because of sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1], race, creed,
religion, age, physical or mental disability, color, or national origin."
Section 5. Section 7-34-2123, MCA, is amended to read:
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 437
"7-34-2123. Admission to district hospital facilities. Such a hospital district must admit persons to
its facilities without regard to race, color, or sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1]. Such obligation shall not
prevent the board of trustees of such hospital district from establishing reasonable minimum rates for hospital
quarters, services, and supplies. Indigents needing such services, for the rendition of which provision is made
by the laws of Montana, must be admitted to such public hospitals on terms and rates prescribed or authorized
by law."

veteran or the spouse or surviving spouse of a veteran. Consideration must also be given to:
(1) the person's age;
(2) the person's physical and mental status;
(3) the person's ability or inability to locate suitable alternative accommodations;
(4) the person's term of residence in Montana;
(5) the person's gender, as provided in [section 1], as it relates to availability of appropriate living
space;
(6) the ability of the Montana veterans' home to meet the person's needs; and
(7) other admission requirements established by the department."
Section 7. Section 13-27-408, MCA, is amended to read:
"13-27-408. Rejection of improper arguments. The secretary of state shall reject, with the approval
of the attorney general, an argument or other matter held to contain obscene, vulgar, profane, scandalous,
libelous, or defamatory matter; any language that in any way incites, counsels, promotes, or advocates hatred,
abuse, violence, or hostility toward, or that tends to cast ridicule or shame upon, a group of persons by reason
of race, color, religion, or sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1]; or any matter not allowed to be sent through
the mail. Such arguments may not be filed or printed in the voter information pamphlet."

Section 8. Section 13-35-301, MCA, is amended to read:
"13-35-301. Adoption of code of fair campaign practices. The following code of fair campaign
practices is adopted by Montana:
"There are basic principles of decency, honesty, and fair play that every candidate for public office in
the United States has a moral obligation to observe and uphold, in order that, after vigorously contested but
fairly conducted campaigns, our citizens may exercise their constitutional right to a free and untrammeled
choice and the will of the people may be fully and clearly expressed on the issues before the country.
Therefore:
I will conduct my campaign in the best American tradition, discussing the issues as I see them,
presenting my record and policies with sincerity and frankness, and criticizing without fear or favor the record
and policies of my opponent and my opponent's party that merit such criticism.
I will defend and uphold the right of every qualified American voter to full and equal participation in the
electoral process.
I will conduct my campaign without the use of personal vilification, character defamation, whispering
campaigns, libel, slander, or scurrilous attacks on my opposition or my opposition's personal or family life.
I will not use campaign material of any sort that misrepresents, distorts, or otherwise falsifies the facts,
nor will I use malicious or unfounded accusations that aim at creating or exploiting doubts, without justification,
as to the loyalty and patriotism of my opposition.
I will not make any appeal to prejudice based on race, sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1], creed, or
national origin.
I will not undertake or condone any dishonest or unethical practice that tends to corrupt or undermine
our American system of free elections or that hampers or prevents the full and free expression of the will of the
voters.
Insofar as is possible, I will immediately and publicly repudiate support deriving from any individual or
group that resorts, on behalf of my candidacy or in opposition to that of my opponent, to the methods and
tactics that I have pledged not to use or condone.""

- 52 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 437
implement the policy established by this section.

rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders back into the community.

principles:

(b) Sentences should be commensurate with the punishment imposed on other persons
committing the same offenses.

obeying the law and must hold the offender accountable for the offender's actions.

treatment.
