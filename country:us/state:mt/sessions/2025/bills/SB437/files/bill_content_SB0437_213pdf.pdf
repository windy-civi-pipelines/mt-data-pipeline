21 WHEREAS, in human beings, there are two -- and only two -- sexes: male and female, which refer to
22 the two body structures (phenotypes) that, in normal development, correspond to one or the other gamete --
23 sperm for males and ova for females; and
24 WHEREAS, every individual is either male or female; and
25 WHEREAS, an individual's sex can be observed or clinically verified at or before birth; and
26 WHEREAS, rare disorders of sexual development are not exceptions to the binary nature of sex; and
27 WHEREAS, in no case is an individual's sex determined by stipulation or self-identification; and
28 WHEREAS, there is increasing confusion about the definition and implications of sex as a biological
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0437.2
1 truth and its relationship to concepts and terms including but not limited to sex assigned at birth, gender, gender
2 identity, gender role, gender expression, and experienced gender; and
3 WHEREAS, confusion and ambiguities surrounding the definitions of sex, male, female, and related
4 terms can hinder individual efforts to enjoy equal treatment under the law; and
5 WHEREAS, legal equality of the two sexes -- male and female -- does not imply that the sexes are
6 identical to each other or are the same in every respect; and
7 WHEREAS, with respect to the two sexes -- male and female -- separate facilities or sports leagues
8 established because of or organized according to physical differences between the sexes do not constitute
9 unequal treatment under the law; and
10 WHEREAS, physical differences between males and females are enduring, and the two sexes are not
11 fungible.
12 THEREFORE, IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE OF THIS STATE TO CLARIFY AND RECONCILE THE
13 MEANING OF SEX, MALE, FEMALE, AND RELATED TERMS IN STATE LAWS, ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, AND GUIDELINES.
14
15 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
16
17 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Terms of wide applicability. (1) Unless the context requires otherwise,
18 the following definitions apply in the Montana Code Annotated:
19 (a) "FATHER" MEANS A MALE PARENT.
20 (B) "Female" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XX
21 chromosomes and produces or would produce relatively large, relatively immobile gametes, or eggs, during her
22 life cycle and has a reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An
23 individual who would otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is female, WHEN
24 USED TO REFER TO A NATURAL PERSON, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NATURALLY HAS, HAD, WILL HAVE, OR WOULD HAVE, BUT
25 FOR A CONGENITAL ANOMALY OR INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL DISRUPTION, THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM THAT AT
26 SOME POINT PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, AND UTILIZES THE LARGE GAMETE, OR OVA, FOR FERTILIZATION.
27 (b) (C) "Male" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XY
28 chromosomes and produces or would produce small, mobile gametes, or sperm, during his life cycle and has a
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0437.2
1 reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An individual who would
2 otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is male, WHEN USED TO REFER TO A
3 NATURAL PERSON, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO NATURALLY HAS, HAD, WILL HAVE, OR WOULD HAVE, BUT FOR A CONGENITAL
4 ANOMALY OR INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL DISRUPTION, THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM THAT AT SOME POINT
5 PRODUCES, TRANSPORTS, AND UTILIZES THE SMALL GAMETE, OR SPERM, FOR FERTILIZATION.
6 (c) (D) "MAN" MEANS AN ADULT HUMAN MALE, EXCEPT WHEN USED AS A GENERIC REFERENCE TO HUMAN
7 BEINGS.
8 (E) "MOTHER" MEANS A FEMALE PARENT.
9 (F) "Oath" includes an affirmation or declaration.
10 (d) (G) "Person" includes a corporation or other entity as well as a natural person.
11 (e) (H) "Several" means two or more.
12 (f) (I) "Sex" means the organization of the body parts and gametes for reproduction in human beings
13 and other organisms. In human beings, there are exactly two sexes, male and female, with two corresponding
14 types of gametes. The sexes are determined by the biological and genetic indication of male or female,
15 including sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex chromosomes, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and
16 external genitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual's psychological, behavioral, social, chosen, or
17 subjective experience of gender WHETHER SOMEONE IS MALE OR FEMALE, WHICH IS DISTINGUISHED BASED ON THE
18 TYPE OF GAMETE, SPERM OR EGGS, THEY ARE CAPABLE OF OR EXPECTED TO PRODUCE, AS DICTATED BY THEIR PRIMARY
19 SEXUAL ANATOMY. BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY TWO TYPES OF GAMETES, SPERM AND OVA, WITH TWO CORRESPONDING
20 REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS, THERE ARE ONLY TWO SEXES: MALE AND FEMALE. AN INDIVIDUAL'S SEX IS ROOTED IN
21 REPRODUCTIVE ANATOMY AND IS IN NO WAY INFLUENCED OR DEFINED BY ONE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE, BEHAVIOR,
22 EXPRESSION, OR PERSONAL IDENTITY.
23 (g) (J) "State", when applied to the different parts of the United States, includes the District of
24 Columbia and the territories.
25 (h) (K) "United States" includes the District of Columbia and the territories.
26 (L) "WOMAN" MEANS AN ADULT HUMAN FEMALE.
27 (2) Wherever the word "man" or "men" or a word that includes the syllable "man" or "men" in
28 combination with other syllables, such as "workman", appears in this code, the word or syllable includes
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 437

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0437.2
1 "woman" or "women" unless the context clearly indicates a contrary intent and unless the subject matter of the
2 statute relates clearly and necessarily to a specific sex only.
3 (3) Whenever the term "heretofore" occurs in any statute, it must be construed to mean any time
4 previous to the day the statute takes effect. Whenever the word "hereafter" occurs, it must be construed to
5 mean the time after the statute containing the term takes effect.
6 (4) (A) THE TERM "GENDER", WHEN USED ALONE TO REFER TO A MALE, FEMALE, OR THE NATURAL
7 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A MALE AND FEMALE:
8 (I) MUST BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM FOR SEX; AND
9 (II) MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM OR SHORT-HAND EXPRESSION FOR GENDER IDENTITY,
10 EXPERIENCED GENDER, GENDER EXPRESSION, OR GENDER ROLE.
11 (B) THE TERM "GENDER" DOES NOT APPLY WHEN IT IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER WORDS OR AS
12 AN ADJECTIVE TO MODIFY OTHER WORDS, OR WHEN CONTEXT OR EXPLICIT DEFINITION IN PREEXISTING STATE LAW,
13 ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, OR GUIDELINES INDICATES OTHERWISE.
14 (C) THE TERM "GENDER IDENTITY", IF USED IN STATE LAW, ADMINISTRATIVE RULES, OR GUIDELINES, MAY
15 NOT BE CONSIDERED A SYNONYM OR SUBSTITUTE FOR SEX OR GENDER.

22 Therefore:
23 I will conduct my campaign in the best American tradition, discussing the issues as I see them,
24 presenting my record and policies with sincerity and frankness, and criticizing without fear or favor the record
25 and policies of my opponent and my opponent's party that merit such criticism.

4 as to the loyalty and patriotism of my opposition.
5 I will not make any appeal to prejudice based on race, sex, as defined in 1-1-201 [section 1], creed, or
6 national origin.
7 I will not undertake or condone any dishonest or unethical practice that tends to corrupt or undermine
8 our American system of free elections or that hampers or prevents the full and free expression of the will of the
9 voters.
10 Insofar as is possible, I will immediately and publicly repudiate support deriving from any individual or
