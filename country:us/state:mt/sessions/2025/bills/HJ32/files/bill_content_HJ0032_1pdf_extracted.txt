Section 1:
69th Legislature HJ 32.1
1 HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 32
3
4 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
5 MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY OF THE AVAILABILITY OF TRAINING AND THE
6 QUALIFICATIONS OF INVESTIGATORS WITHIN MONTANA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES; AND
7 REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
8
9 WHEREAS, victims of serious crimes in Montana deserve to have those crimes investigated by
10 members of law enforcement with training and expertise specific to those offenses; and
11 WHEREAS, according to the most recent Montana Law Enforcement Employment Survey administered
12 by the Montana Board of Crime Control, there are approximately 117 law enforcement agencies across
13 Montana, which are made up of officers with varying levels of training and experience in advanced investigation
14 techniques; and
15 WHEREAS, of the 55 county sheriff's departments in Montana, 16 of those departments employ five or
16 fewer law enforcement officers, and of the 46 municipal police departments, 22 employ five or fewer officers;
17 and
18 WHEREAS, investigations of sexual assaults and homicides demand a higher level of training and skill
19 than is acquired by obtaining a basic POST certification from the Public Safety Officer Standards and Training
20 Council; and
21 WHEREAS, requiring law enforcement officers to receive advanced training increases the probability of
22 successful resolutions to sexual assault and homicide cases and helps to avoid false charges and inadequate
23 case preparation and decreases the likelihood of a successful appeal following a conviction.
24
25 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
26 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
27 That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory

3 5, part 5, that are currently available to Montana peace officers;
4 (2) survey Montana law enforcement agencies and review the availability and quantity of peace
5 officers who are qualified to investigate the crimes enumerated in subsection (1); and
6 (3) examine opportunities to increase the number of qualified investigators in Montana and, if
7 necessary, consider legislation to help mitigate current deficiencies.
8 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all aspects of the study, including presentation and review
9 requirements, be concluded prior to September 15, 2026.
