Section 1:
69th Legislature HJ 32
MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY OF THE AVAILABILITY OF TRAINING AND THE
QUALIFICATIONS OF INVESTIGATORS WITHIN MONTANA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES; AND
REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, victims of serious crimes in Montana deserve to have those crimes investigated by
members of law enforcement with training and expertise specific to those offenses; and
WHEREAS, according to the most recent Montana Law Enforcement Employment Survey administered
by the Montana Board of Crime Control, there are approximately 117 law enforcement agencies across
Montana, which are made up of officers with varying levels of training and experience in advanced investigation
techniques; and
WHEREAS, of the 55 county sheriff's departments in Montana, 16 of those departments employ five or
fewer law enforcement officers, and of the 46 municipal police departments, 22 employ five or fewer officers;
and
WHEREAS, investigations of sexual assaults and homicides demand a higher level of training and skill
than is acquired by obtaining a basic POST certification from the Public Safety Officer Standards and Training
Council; and
WHEREAS, requiring law enforcement officers to receive advanced training increases the probability of
successful resolutions to sexual assault and homicide cases and helps to avoid false charges and inadequate
case preparation and decreases the likelihood of a successful appeal following a conviction.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:

officers who are qualified to investigate the crimes enumerated in subsection (1); and
(3) examine opportunities to increase the number of qualified investigators in Montana and, if
necessary, consider legislation to help mitigate current deficiencies.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all aspects of the study, including presentation and review
requirements, be concluded prior to September 15, 2026.
