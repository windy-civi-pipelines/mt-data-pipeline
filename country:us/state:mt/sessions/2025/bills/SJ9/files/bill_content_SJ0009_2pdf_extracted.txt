NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:

and decisive action to devise disciplined fiscal rules, such as the gold-linked dollar and a balanced budget
amendment to the United States Constitution.
(2) That the legislatures of the several states join with the State of Montana and send their own
unique resolutions to the United States Congress demanding action to address the fiscal vulnerabilities of the
United States and the inflationary harm inflicted on its citizens by repeated failures to address mounting debt,
deficits, and debt service being incurred by the federal government.
(3) That this resolution be sent to the Montana Congressional Delegation, including Senator
Daines, Senator Sheehy, Representative Zinke, and Representative Downing, and the presiding officers and
