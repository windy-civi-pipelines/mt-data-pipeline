69th Legislature 2025 SJ 9.1
1 WHEREAS, the International Monetary Fund has warned the United States that increased government
2 spending, growing public debt, and loose fiscal policy are leading to elevated interest rates and sustained
3 inflation; and
4 WHEREAS, sustained inflation and interest rates have led to crippling price increases on essential
5 food, transportation, energy, and housing, harming Montanans and American consumers; and
6 WHEREAS, inflationary theft that has been caused by the loose monetary policy and fiscal
7 recklessness of Congress is immoral, repugnant, and devastating to those who are least able to afford it; and
8 WHEREAS, expansive fiscal and monetary policy rewards the government, corporations, and wealthy
9 investors at the expense of the middle class and to the detriment of real growth; and
10 WHEREAS, the people of Montana and the United States have grave concerns about the ability of our
11 military to protect our nation from foreign adversaries and our citizens' ability to provide the most basic
12 necessities for their families.
13
14 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
15 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
16 (1) That the United States Congress address the exigent needs of our nation and take immediate
17 and decisive action to devise disciplined fiscal rules, such as the gold-linked dollar and a balanced budget
18 amendment to the United States Constitution.
19 (2) That the legislatures of the several states join with the State of Montana and send their own
20 unique resolutions to the United States Congress demanding action to address the fiscal vulnerabilities of the
21 United States and the inflationary harm inflicted on its citizens by repeated failures to address mounting debt,
22 deficits, and debt service being incurred by the federal government.
23 (3) That this resolution be sent to the Montana Congressional Delegation, including Senator
24 Daines, Senator Sheehy, Representative Zinke, and Representative Downing, and the presiding officers and
