CONFORMITY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS
As required pursuant to section 5-11-112(1)(c), MCA, it is the Legislative Services Division's
statutory responsibility to conduct "legal review of draft bills". The comments noted below
regarding conformity with state and federal constitutions are provided to assist the Legislature
in making its own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill. The comments are based
on an analysis of jurisdictionally relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the
bill. The comments are not written for the purpose of influencing whether the bill should
become law but are written to provide information relevant to the Legislature's consideration
of this bill. The comments are not a formal legal opinion and are not a substitute for the
judgment of the judiciary, which has the authority to determine the constitutionality of a law in
the context of a specific case.
This review is intended to inform the bill draft requestor of potential constitutional conformity
issues that may be raised by the bill as drafted. This review IS NOT dispositive of the issue of
constitutional conformity and the general rule as repeatedly stated by the Montana Supreme
Court is that an enactment of the Legislature is presumed to be constitutional unless it is
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the enactment is unconstitutional. See Alexander v.
Bozeman Motors, Inc., 356 Mont. 439, 234 P.3d 880 (2010); Eklund v. Wheatland County,
351 Mont. 370, 212 P.3d 297 (2009); St. v. Pyette, 337 Mont. 265, 159 P.3d 232 (2007); and
Elliott v. Dept. of Revenue, 334 Mont. 195, 146 P.3d 741 (2006).
Legal Reviewer Comments:
HB 439 provides that federal employees who are not Montana peace officers must obtain the
written permission of a county sheriff to execute an arrest, search, or seizure in the county where
the arrest, search, or seizure will occur, except under certain circumstances. The county sheriff
may refuse permission for any reason. Federal employees may exercise one of the enumerated
exceptions in the draft by requesting and receiving the written permission of the Montana
Attorney General. Similarly, the Attorney General may refuse the request for any reason.
There are several consequences provided in the proposed legislation for noncompliance. For
example, as drafted, any arrest, search, or seizure in violation of the legislation would subject a
federal employee to prosecution by the county attorney for kidnapping or various other offenses.
A county attorney would be required to prosecute a claim by the county sheriff, and any failure to
prosecute could subject the county attorney to recall by the voters and prosecution for official
misconduct.
As drafted, HB 439 may raise potential legal issues regarding whether the proposed legislation
complies with federal law. The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution provides:
This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in
pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the
authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges
in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any
State to the contrary notwithstanding.
U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. The Supremacy Clause provides that if a conflict between state and
federal law exists, federal law controls and state law is preempted.
If a federal agent is charged with a violation of state law, the federal agent can assert a
Supremacy Clause immunity defense. In a United State Supreme Court decision dating back to
1890, a federal officer was released from a state criminal charge where the alleged crime arose
during the performance of federal duties. In re Neagle, 135 U.S. 1, 75-76, 10 S. Ct. 658 (1890).
The case law has been expanded since 1890, but ultimately once a Supremacy Clause immunity
defense is established the prosecution has no basis upon which to prosecute a federal agent.
Clifton v. Cox, 549 F.2d 722, 730 (9th Cir. 1977). The defense is established by showing that a
federal agent "employed means which he could . . . honestly consider reasonable in discharging
his duties." Id. at 730.
Likewise, the Supremacy clause immunity defense does not exist when a federal agent "was
acting outside the scope of his authority or ... [when] he employed means which he could not
honestly consider reasonable in discharging his duties. Id. The defense also does not exist if a
federal agent acts out of "out of malice or with some criminal intent". Id. at 728.
The proposed legislation may hinder federal agents from reasonably discharging duties while
enforcing federal law. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 3052, 3107 (subpoena enforcement and arrests by
FBI agents). As such, HB 439 may raise potential conformity issues with the Supremacy Clause
of the U.S. Constitution.
Requester Comments:
This Legal Note makes several errors fatal to its argument.
First, the Note ignores the prime principle of our form of government, dual sovereignty. The Note
assumes, as may be taught in law schools favoring a limitless federal government, that the
Supremacy Clause empowers the federal government to exercise any power it wishes,
notwithstanding state powers and laws. If this were correct, all employees of the federal
government would be exempt from state laws criminalizing murder, rape, robbery, and other
prohibited conduct. They are not so exempt because of dual sovereignty and states' retention of
police powers. There are substantial limits on application of the Supremacy Clause consistent with
dual sovereignty.
Second, the Note conveniently ignores the fact that the Supremacy Clause was amended. The
effect of an amendment is to change or modify the underlying law that it amends. Whatever the
Supremacy Clause may have meant when adopted, that meaning was amended and changed
forever by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. Those two amendments clarify and assert
substantial restraints on application of the Supremacy Clause, an effect the Legal Note seeks to
ignore or wish away. That wish is unimpressive as a legal argument.
Third, the Legal Note commits a fatal error of overt omission, an omission that leads to a wrong
conclusion. The "Supremacy Clause" of the U.S. Constitution, says, in part, "This Constitution,
and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof ..." (emphasis added.)
The fatal omission of the Legal Note is the failure to account for or admit the import of the words
"in pursuance thereof". These words control to the extent of allowing the Supremacy Clause to
apply ONLY to federal laws made with authority granted Congress in the Constitution, specifically
in the "enumerated powers."
Alexander Hamilton, at New York’s convention: “I maintain that the word supreme imports no
more than this — that the Constitution, and laws made in pursuance thereof, cannot be controlled
or defeated by any other law. The acts of the United States, therefore, will be absolutely obligatory
as to all the proper objects and powers of the general government ... but the laws of Congress are
restricted to a certain sphere, and when they depart from this sphere, they are no longer supreme
or binding” (emphasis added).
In Federalist #33, Hamilton added: “It will not, I presume, have escaped observation that it
expressly confines this supremacy to laws made pursuant to the Constitution ....”
Thomas McKean, at the Pennsylvania convention: “The meaning [of the Supremacy Clause] which
appears to be plain and well expressed is simply this, that Congress have the power of making laws
upon any subject over which the proposed plan gives them a jurisdiction, and that those laws, thus
made in pursuance of the Constitution, shall be binding upon the states”. (emphasis added).
James Iredell, at the First North Carolina convention: “When Congress passes a law consistent
with the Constitution, it is to be binding on the people. If Congress, under pretense of executing
one power, should, in fact, usurp another, they will violate the Constitution.”
It is widely understood and accepted that the states did not delegate the "police powers" to the
federal government in the Constitution, but reserved those to the states. If there were any question
about this, one merely needs to observe that police powers are not among the enumerated powers
the states delegated to Congress, and then refer to the Tenth Amendment to see that the police
powers, not having been delegated, were reserved to the states and the people.
In Printz v.U.S., 521 U.S. 898, 913 (1997), the U.S. Supreme Court declared:
"It is incontestible that the Constitution established a system of 'dual sovereignty.' Gregory v.
Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 457 (1991); Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, 458 (1990). Although the States
surrendered many of their powers to the new Federal Government, they retained 'a residuary and
inviolable sovereignty,' The Federalist No. 39, at 245 (J. Madison). This is reflected throughout the
Constitution's text, Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869); Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700,
725 (1869), including (to mention only a few examples) the prohibition on any involuntary
reduction or combination of a State's territory, Art. IV, §3; the Judicial Power Clause, Art. III, §2,
and the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Art. IV, §2, which speak of the 'Citizens' of the States;
the amendment provision, Article V, which requires the votes of three fourths of the States to
amend the Constitution; and the Guarantee Clause, Art. IV, §4, which 'presupposes the continued
existence of the states and . . . those means and instrumentalities which are the creation of their
sovereign and reserved rights,' Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U.S. 405, 414-415 (1938). Residual
state sovereignty was also implicit, of course, in the Constitution's conferral upon Congress of not
all governmental powers, but only discrete, enumerated ones, Art. I, §8, which implication was
rendered express by the Tenth Amendment's assertion that '[t]he powers not delegated to the
United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people.' "
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said in Idaho v. Horiuchi:
"Power being almost always the rival of power, the general government will at times stand ready to
check the usurpations of the state governments, and these will have the same disposition towards
the general government. If [the people's] rights are invaded by either, they can make use of the
other as the instrument of redress.
The Federalist No. 28, at 181 (Alexander Hamilton) (C. Rossiter ed., 1961).
We have grown accustomed to relying on the federal government to protect our liberties against
the excesses of state law enforcement. Federal prosecutors may bring criminal charges against
state police who violate the rights of citizens. See, e.g., Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 116
S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). Those citizens may also seek redress by bringing private suits
in federal court. See 42 U.S.C. §1983. While state prosecutions of federal officers are less
common, they provide an avenue of redress on the flip side of the federalism coin. When federal
officers violate the Constitution, either through malice or excessive zeal, they can be held
accountable for violating the state's criminal laws."
Concerning the issue of qualified immunity for federal officers raised by the Note, that also is not
without limits. The reader is referred to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Groh v. Ramirez,
540 US 551 - Supreme Court 2004. In that decision, SCOTUS clarified that qualified immunity
depends on "whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the
situation he confronted." Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 202 (2001). Thus, a federal officer
violating the law is not entitled to qualified immunity as a defense against a state prosecution.
In conclusion, by reading the Constitution as if Supremacy Clause words "in pursuance thereof"
had been removed, as if the Ninth and Tenth Amendments were absent, and by ignoring the prime
principle of dual sovereignty, the Legal Note arrives at an incorrect conclusion. This view may be
favored by those who prefer a strong federal government of limitless power, but it is not correct.
The Legal Note that relies on the legal philosophy of limitless federal power is also incorrect.
