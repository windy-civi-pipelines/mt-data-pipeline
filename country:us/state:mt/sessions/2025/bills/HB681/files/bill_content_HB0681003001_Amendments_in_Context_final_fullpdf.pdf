14 acres, the governing body may require approval by the department of environmental quality as a condition of
15 approval of the final plat.
16 (b) For a proposed subdivision that will create one or more parcels containing 20 acres or more,
17 the governing body may condition approval of the final plat upon the subdivider demonstrating, pursuant to 76-
18 3-622, that there is an adequate water source and at least one area for a septic system and a replacement
19 drainfield for each lot.
20 (c) Except for lots served by a hauled water cistern, an adequate municipal facility, or an adequate
21 county water and/or sewer district facility, as defined in 76-4-102, or that are determined to not need water, a

1 (9) (a) Review and approval, conditional approval, or denial of a proposed subdivision under this
2 chapter may occur only under those regulations in effect at the time a subdivision application is determined to
3 contain sufficient information for review as provided in subsection (2).
4 (b) If regulations change during the review periods provided in subsections (1) and (2), the

11 Section 3. Section 76-3-608, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "76-3-608. Criteria for local government review. (1) The basis for the governing body's decision to
13 approve, conditionally approve, or deny a proposed subdivision is whether the subdivision application,
14 preliminary plat, applicable environmental assessment, public hearing, planning board recommendations, or
15 additional information demonstrates that development of the proposed subdivision meets the requirements of
16 this chapter. A governing body may not deny approval of a proposed subdivision based solely on the
17 subdivision's impacts on educational services or based solely on parcels within the subdivision having been
18 designated as wildland-urban interface parcels under 76-13-145.
19 (2) The governing body shall issue written findings of fact that weigh the criteria in subsection (3),
20 as applicable.
21 (3) A subdivision proposal must undergo review for the following primary criteria:
22 (a) except when the governing body has established an exemption pursuant to subsection (6) or
23 except as provided in 76-3-509, 76-3-609(2) or (4), or 76-3-616, the specific, documentable, and clearly defined
24 impact on agriculture, agricultural water user facilities, local services, the natural environment, wildlife, wildlife
25 habitat, and public health and safety, excluding any consideration of whether the proposed subdivision will
26 result in a loss of agricultural soils;
27 (b) compliance with:

1 (i) the survey requirements provided for in part 4 of this chapter;
2 (ii) the local subdivision regulations provided for in part 5 of this chapter; and
3 (iii) the local subdivision review procedure provided for in this part;
4 (c) the provision of easements within and to the proposed subdivision for the location and
5 installation of any planned utilities; and
6 (d) the provision of legal and physical access to each parcel within the proposed subdivision and
7 the required notation of that access on the applicable plat and any instrument of transfer concerning the parcel.
8 (4) The governing body may require the subdivider to design the proposed subdivision to
9 reasonably minimize potentially significant adverse impacts identified through the review required under
10 subsection (3) but may not require a set-aside of land or monetary contribution for the loss of agricultural soils.
11 Pursuant to 76-3-620, the governing body shall issue written findings to justify the reasonable mitigation
12 required under this subsection (4).
13 (5) (a) In reviewing a proposed subdivision under subsection (3) and when requiring mitigation
14 under subsection (4), a governing body may not unreasonably restrict a landowner's ability to develop land, but
15 it is recognized that in some instances the impacts of a proposed development may be deemed unmitigable
16 and will preclude approval of the subdivision.
17 (b) When requiring mitigation under subsection (4) and consistent with 76-3-620, a governing body
18 shall consult with the subdivider and shall give due weight and consideration to the expressed preference of the
19 subdivider.
20 (6) (a) A governing body may conditionally approve or deny a proposed subdivision as a result of
21 the water and sanitation information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 or public comment received pursuant to 76-
22 3-604 on the information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 only if the conditional approval or denial is based on
23 existing subdivision, zoning, or other regulations that the governing body has the authority to enforce.
24 (b) Except for proposed subdivisions served by a hauled water cistern, an adequate municipal
25 facility, or an adequate county water and/or sewer district facility, as defined in 76-4-102, or that are determined
26 to not need water, a governing body may require as a condition of subdivision approval that an applicant obtain
27 approval from the department of natural resources and conservation to appropriate water pursuant to Title 85,

1 chapter 2.
2 (7) A governing body may not require as a condition of subdivision approval that a property owner
3 waive a right to protest the creation of a special improvement district or a rural improvement district for capital
4 improvement projects that does not identify the specific capital improvements for which protest is being waived.
5 A waiver of a right to protest may not be valid for a time period longer than 20 years after the date that the final
6 subdivision plat is filed with the county clerk and recorder.
7 (8) A governing body may not approve a proposed subdivision if any of the features and
8 improvements of the subdivision encroach onto adjoining private property in a manner that is not otherwise
9 provided for under chapter 4 or this chapter or if the well isolation zone of any proposed well to be drilled for the
10 proposed subdivision encroaches onto adjoining private property unless the owner of the private property
11 authorizes the encroachment. For the purposes of this section, "well isolation zone" has the meaning provided
12 in 76-4-102.
13 (9) If a federal or state governmental entity submits a written or oral comment or an opinion
14 regarding wildlife, wildlife habitat, or the natural environment relating to a subdivision application for the purpose
15 of assisting a governing body's review, the comment or opinion may be included in the governing body's written
16 statement under 76-3-620 only if the comment or opinion provides scientific information or a published study
17 that supports the comment or opinion. A governmental entity that is or has been involved in an effort to acquire
18 or assist others in acquiring an interest in the real property identified in the subdivision application shall disclose
19 that the entity has been involved in that effort prior to submitting a comment, an opinion, or information as
20 provided in this subsection.
21 (10) Findings of fact by the governing body concerning whether the development of the proposed
22 subdivision meets the requirements of this chapter must be based on the record as a whole. The governing
23 body's findings of fact must be sustained unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful."
