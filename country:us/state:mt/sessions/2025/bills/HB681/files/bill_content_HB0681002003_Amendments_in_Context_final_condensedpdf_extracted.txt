6 emergency fire-related operations, which may include enclosed storage;
7 (ii) when a maximum appropriation of 350 gallons a minute or less is used in nonconsumptive
8 geothermal heating or cooling exchange applications, all of the water extracted is returned without delay to the
9 same source aquifer, and the distance between the extraction well and both the nearest existing well and the
10 hydraulically connected surface waters is more than twice the distance between the extraction well and the
11 injection well;
12 (iii) when the appropriation is outside a stream depletion zone, is 35 gallons a minute or less, and
13 does not exceed 10 acre-feet a year, except that a combined appropriation from the same source by two or
14 more wells or developed springs exceeding 10 acre-feet, regardless of the flow rate, requires a permit; or
15 (iv) when the appropriation is within a stream depletion zone, is 20 gallons a minute or less, and
16 does not exceed 2 acre-feet a year, except that a combined appropriation from the same source by two or more
17 wells or developed springs exceeding this limitation requires a permit.

4 necessary under subsection (1). The original of the certificate must be sent to the appropriator and a duplicate
5 must be maintained in the department's centralized database. The department shall keep a copy of the
6 certificate in its office in Helena. The date of filing of the notice of completion is the date of priority of the right.
7 (d) (i) Construction of a water supply system subject to Title 75, chapter 6, part 1, and use of a
8 permit exception for the appropriation of water pursuant to this section is proof of beneficial use.

10 certificate of water right after the conditions in subsection (3)(d)(i) are met.
11 (iii) The department shall consider a water right as perfected after the conditions in subsection
12 (3)(d)(i) are met.
13 (iv) When the appropriation is for a water supply system that is subject to Title 75, chapter 6, part 1,
14 and is located outside of a stream depletion zone and does not exceed 10 acre-feet a year:
15 (A) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b)(i), the appropriation will be considered perfected upon
16 completion of construction of the water supply system.
17 (B) A copy of the department of environmental quality approval for the water supply system must
18 be submitted with the notice of completion. This section does not preclude the public water supply developer or
19 any subsequent owners from expanding the water system or from revising the water use restrictions within the
20 subdivision, provided that the total amount does not exceed 10 acre-feet per year.
21 (C) Water appropriated under this exception must be measured and reported annually to the
22 department.
23 (4) An appropriator of ground water by means of a well or developed spring first put to beneficial

25 force prior to April 14, 1981, with the county clerk and recorder shall file a notice of completion, as provided in
26 subsection (3), with the department to perfect the water right. The filing of a claim pursuant to 85-2-221 is
27 sufficient notice of completion under this subsection. The priority date of the appropriation is the date of the

2 (5) An appropriation under subsection (4) is an existing right, and a permit is not required.
3 However, the department shall acknowledge the receipt of a correct and complete filing of a notice of
4 completion, except that for an appropriation of 35 gallons a minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet a year,

6 need not be issued under the adjudication proceedings provided for in 85-2-236.
7 (6) A permit is not required before constructing an impoundment or pit and appropriating water for
8 use by livestock if:
9 (a) the maximum capacity of the impoundment or pit is less than 15 acre-feet;
10 (b) the appropriation is less than 30 acre-feet a year;
11 (c) the appropriation is from an ephemeral stream, an intermittent stream, or another source other
12 than a perennial flowing stream; and
13 (d) the impoundment or pit is to be constructed on and will be accessible to a parcel of land that is
14 owned or under the control of the applicant and that is 40 acres or larger.
15 (7) (a) Within 60 days after constructing an impoundment or pit, the appropriator shall apply for a
16 permit as prescribed by this part. Subject to subsection (7)(b), upon receipt of a correct and complete
17 application for a stock water provisional permit, the department shall automatically issue a provisional permit. If
18 the department determines after a hearing that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely
19 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
20 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
21 of other appropriators.
22 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
23 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
24 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
25 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
26 (8) A person may also appropriate water without applying for or prior to receiving a permit under
27 rules adopted by the department under 85-2-113.

1 filing of a notice, as provided in subsection (3), or the date of the filing of the claim of existing water right.
2 (5) An appropriation under subsection (4) is an existing right, and a permit is not required.
3 However, the department shall acknowledge the receipt of a correct and complete filing of a notice of
4 completion, except that for an appropriation of 35 gallons a minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet a year,
5 the department shall issue a certificate of water right. If a certificate is issued under this section, a certificate
6 need not be issued under the adjudication proceedings provided for in 85-2-236.
7 (6) A permit is not required before constructing an impoundment or pit and appropriating water for
8 use by livestock if:
9 (a) the maximum capacity of the impoundment or pit is less than 15 acre-feet;
10 (b) the appropriation is less than 30 acre-feet a year;
11 (c) the appropriation is from an ephemeral stream, an intermittent stream, or another source other
12 than a perennial flowing stream; and
13 (d) the impoundment or pit is to be constructed on and will be accessible to a parcel of land that is
14 owned or under the control of the applicant and that is 40 acres or larger.
15 (7) (a) Within 60 days after constructing an impoundment or pit, the appropriator shall apply for a
16 permit as prescribed by this part. Subject to subsection (7)(b), upon receipt of a correct and complete
17 application for a stock water provisional permit, the department shall automatically issue a provisional permit. If
18 the department determines after a hearing that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely
19 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
20 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
21 of other appropriators.
22 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
23 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
24 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
25 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
26 (8) A person may also appropriate water without applying for or prior to receiving a permit under
27 rules adopted by the department under 85-2-113.
