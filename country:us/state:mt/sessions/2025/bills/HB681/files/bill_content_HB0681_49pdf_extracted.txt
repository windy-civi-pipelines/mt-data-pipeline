1 to allow for review of the proposed subdivision, the reviewing agent or agency shall identify the insufficient
2 information in its notification.
3 (c) A determination that an application contains sufficient information for review as provided in this
4 subsection (2) does not ensure that the proposed subdivision will be approved or conditionally approved by the
5 governing body and does not limit the ability of the reviewing agent or agency or the governing body to request
6 additional information during the review process.
7 (3) The time limits provided in subsections (1) and (2) apply to each submittal of the application

7 Section 3. Section 76-3-608, MCA, is amended to read:
8 "76-3-608. Criteria for local government review. (1) The basis for the governing body's decision to
9 approve, conditionally approve, or deny a proposed subdivision is whether the subdivision application,
10 preliminary plat, applicable environmental assessment, public hearing, planning board recommendations, or
11 additional information demonstrates that development of the proposed subdivision meets the requirements of
12 this chapter. A governing body may not deny approval of a proposed subdivision based solely on the
13 subdivision's impacts on educational services or based solely on parcels within the subdivision having been
14 designated as wildland-urban interface parcels under 76-13-145.
15 (2) The governing body shall issue written findings of fact that weigh the criteria in subsection (3),
16 as applicable.
17 (3) A subdivision proposal must undergo review for the following primary criteria:
18 (a) except when the governing body has established an exemption pursuant to subsection (6) or
19 except as provided in 76-3-509, 76-3-609(2) or (4), or 76-3-616, the specific, documentable, and clearly defined
20 impact on agriculture, agricultural water user facilities, local services, the natural environment, wildlife, wildlife
21 habitat, and public health and safety, excluding any consideration of whether the proposed subdivision will
22 result in a loss of agricultural soils;
23 (b) compliance with:
24 (i) the survey requirements provided for in part 4 of this chapter;
25 (ii) the local subdivision regulations provided for in part 5 of this chapter; and
26 (iii) the local subdivision review procedure provided for in this part;
27 (c) the provision of easements within and to the proposed subdivision for the location and
28 installation of any planned utilities; and
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 681
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0681.4
1 (d) the provision of legal and physical access to each parcel within the proposed subdivision and
2 the required notation of that access on the applicable plat and any instrument of transfer concerning the parcel.
3 (4) The governing body may require the subdivider to design the proposed subdivision to
4 reasonably minimize potentially significant adverse impacts identified through the review required under
5 subsection (3) but may not require a set-aside of land or monetary contribution for the loss of agricultural soils.
6 Pursuant to 76-3-620, the governing body shall issue written findings to justify the reasonable mitigation
7 required under this subsection (4).
8 (5) (a) In reviewing a proposed subdivision under subsection (3) and when requiring mitigation
9 under subsection (4), a governing body may not unreasonably restrict a landowner's ability to develop land, but
10 it is recognized that in some instances the impacts of a proposed development may be deemed unmitigable
11 and will preclude approval of the subdivision.
12 (b) When requiring mitigation under subsection (4) and consistent with 76-3-620, a governing body
13 shall consult with the subdivider and shall give due weight and consideration to the expressed preference of the
14 subdivider.
15 (6) (a) A governing body may conditionally approve or deny a proposed subdivision as a result of
16 the water and sanitation information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 or public comment received pursuant to 76-
17 3-604 on the information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 only if the conditional approval or denial is based on
18 existing subdivision, zoning, or other regulations that the governing body has the authority to enforce.
19 (b) Except for proposed subdivisions served by a hauled water cistern, an adequate municipal
20 facility, or an adequate county water and/or sewer district facility, as defined in 76-4-102, or that are determined
21 to not need water, a governing body may require as a condition of subdivision approval that an applicant obtain
22 approval from the department of natural resources and conservation to appropriate water pursuant to Title 85,
23 chapter 2.
24 (7) A governing body may not require as a condition of subdivision approval that a property owner
25 waive a right to protest the creation of a special improvement district or a rural improvement district for capital
26 improvement projects that does not identify the specific capital improvements for which protest is being waived.
27 A waiver of a right to protest may not be valid for a time period longer than 20 years after the date that the final
28 subdivision plat is filed with the county clerk and recorder.

69th Legislature 2025 HB0681.4
1 (8) A governing body may not approve a proposed subdivision if any of the features and
2 improvements of the subdivision encroach onto adjoining private property in a manner that is not otherwise
3 provided for under chapter 4 or this chapter or if the well isolation zone of any proposed well to be drilled for the
4 proposed subdivision encroaches onto adjoining private property unless the owner of the private property
5 authorizes the encroachment. For the purposes of this section, "well isolation zone" has the meaning provided
6 in 76-4-102.
7 (9) If a federal or state governmental entity submits a written or oral comment or an opinion
8 regarding wildlife, wildlife habitat, or the natural environment relating to a subdivision application for the purpose
9 of assisting a governing body's review, the comment or opinion may be included in the governing body's written
10 statement under 76-3-620 only if the comment or opinion provides scientific information or a published study
11 that supports the comment or opinion. A governmental entity that is or has been involved in an effort to acquire
12 or assist others in acquiring an interest in the real property identified in the subdivision application shall disclose
13 that the entity has been involved in that effort prior to submitting a comment, an opinion, or information as
14 provided in this subsection.
15 (10) Findings of fact by the governing body concerning whether the development of the proposed
16 subdivision meets the requirements of this chapter must be based on the record as a whole. The governing
17 body's findings of fact must be sustained unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful."

22 (2) (a) Within 15 working days after the reviewing agent or agency notifies the subdivider or the
23 subdivider's agent that the application contains all of the required elements as provided in subsection (1), the
24 reviewing agent or agency shall determine whether the application and required elements contain detailed,
25 supporting information that is sufficient to allow for the review of the proposed subdivision under the provisions
26 of this chapter and the local regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter and shall notify the subdivider or, with
27 the subdivider's written permission, the subdivider's agent of the reviewing agent's or agency's determination.

- 2 - Authorized Print Version – HB 681

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0681.4
1 to allow for review of the proposed subdivision, the reviewing agent or agency shall identify the insufficient
2 information in its notification.
3 (c) A determination that an application contains sufficient information for review as provided in this
4 subsection (2) does not ensure that the proposed subdivision will be approved or conditionally approved by the
5 governing body and does not limit the ability of the reviewing agent or agency or the governing body to request
6 additional information during the review process.
7 (3) The time limits provided in subsections (1) and (2) apply to each submittal of the application
8 until:
9 (a) a determination is made that the application contains the required elements and sufficient
10 information; and

12 (4) After the reviewing agent or agency has notified the subdivider or the subdivider's agent that an
13 application contains sufficient information as provided in subsection (2), the governing body shall approve,
14 conditionally approve, or deny the proposed subdivision within 60 working days or 80 working days if the
15 proposed subdivision contains 50 or more lots, based on its determination of whether the application conforms

23 application, until the governing body denies, approves, or conditionally approves the subdivision.
24 (b) The provisions of subsection (5)(a) do not apply if the review period is extended or suspended
25 pursuant to subsection (4).
26 (6) If the governing body denies or conditionally approves the proposed subdivision, it shall send

2 summary of the comments submitted available to the subdivider within 30 days after conditional approval or
3 approval of the subdivision application and preliminary plat.
4 (b) The subdivider shall, as part of the subdivider's application for sanitation approval, forward the
5 comments or the summary provided by the governing body to the:
6 (i) reviewing authority provided for in Title 76, chapter 4, for subdivisions that will create one or
7 more parcels containing less than 20 acres; and
8 (ii) local health department or board of health for proposed subdivisions that will create one or
9 more parcels containing 20 acres or more and less than 160 acres.
10 (8) (a) For a proposed subdivision that will create one or more parcels containing less than 20
11 acres, the governing body may require approval by the department of environmental quality as a condition of
12 approval of the final plat.
13 (b) For a proposed subdivision that will create one or more parcels containing 20 acres or more,
14 the governing body may condition approval of the final plat upon the subdivider demonstrating, pursuant to 76-
15 3-622, that there is an adequate water source and at least one area for a septic system and a replacement
16 drainfield for each lot.
17 (c) Except for lots served by a hauled water cistern, an adequate municipal facility, or an adequate
18 county water and/or sewer district facility, as defined in 76-4-102, or that are determined to not need water, a

27 contain sufficient information for review as provided in subsection (2).
28 (b) If regulations change during the review periods provided in subsections (1) and (2), the
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 681

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0681.4
1 determination of whether the application contains the required elements and sufficient information must be
2 based on the new regulations.
3 (10) Unless otherwise provided by law, the governing body may review but does not have approval
4 authority of the governing documents of the subdivision or amendments to the governing documents unless the
5 governing documents directly and materially impact a condition of subdivision approval."
6
7 Section 3. Section 76-3-608, MCA, is amended to read:
8 "76-3-608. Criteria for local government review. (1) The basis for the governing body's decision to
9 approve, conditionally approve, or deny a proposed subdivision is whether the subdivision application,
10 preliminary plat, applicable environmental assessment, public hearing, planning board recommendations, or
11 additional information demonstrates that development of the proposed subdivision meets the requirements of
12 this chapter. A governing body may not deny approval of a proposed subdivision based solely on the
13 subdivision's impacts on educational services or based solely on parcels within the subdivision having been
14 designated as wildland-urban interface parcels under 76-13-145.
15 (2) The governing body shall issue written findings of fact that weigh the criteria in subsection (3),
16 as applicable.
17 (3) A subdivision proposal must undergo review for the following primary criteria:
18 (a) except when the governing body has established an exemption pursuant to subsection (6) or
19 except as provided in 76-3-509, 76-3-609(2) or (4), or 76-3-616, the specific, documentable, and clearly defined
20 impact on agriculture, agricultural water user facilities, local services, the natural environment, wildlife, wildlife
21 habitat, and public health and safety, excluding any consideration of whether the proposed subdivision will
22 result in a loss of agricultural soils;
23 (b) compliance with:
24 (i) the survey requirements provided for in part 4 of this chapter;
25 (ii) the local subdivision regulations provided for in part 5 of this chapter; and
26 (iii) the local subdivision review procedure provided for in this part;
27 (c) the provision of easements within and to the proposed subdivision for the location and
28 installation of any planned utilities; and
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 681

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0681.4
1 (d) the provision of legal and physical access to each parcel within the proposed subdivision and
2 the required notation of that access on the applicable plat and any instrument of transfer concerning the parcel.
3 (4) The governing body may require the subdivider to design the proposed subdivision to
4 reasonably minimize potentially significant adverse impacts identified through the review required under
5 subsection (3) but may not require a set-aside of land or monetary contribution for the loss of agricultural soils.
6 Pursuant to 76-3-620, the governing body shall issue written findings to justify the reasonable mitigation
7 required under this subsection (4).
8 (5) (a) In reviewing a proposed subdivision under subsection (3) and when requiring mitigation
9 under subsection (4), a governing body may not unreasonably restrict a landowner's ability to develop land, but
10 it is recognized that in some instances the impacts of a proposed development may be deemed unmitigable
11 and will preclude approval of the subdivision.
12 (b) When requiring mitigation under subsection (4) and consistent with 76-3-620, a governing body
13 shall consult with the subdivider and shall give due weight and consideration to the expressed preference of the
14 subdivider.
15 (6) (a) A governing body may conditionally approve or deny a proposed subdivision as a result of
16 the water and sanitation information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 or public comment received pursuant to 76-
17 3-604 on the information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 only if the conditional approval or denial is based on
18 existing subdivision, zoning, or other regulations that the governing body has the authority to enforce.
19 (b) Except for proposed subdivisions served by a hauled water cistern, an adequate municipal
20 facility, or an adequate county water and/or sewer district facility, as defined in 76-4-102, or that are determined
21 to not need water, a governing body may require as a condition of subdivision approval that an applicant obtain
22 approval from the department of natural resources and conservation to appropriate water pursuant to Title 85,
23 chapter 2.
24 (7) A governing body may not require as a condition of subdivision approval that a property owner
25 waive a right to protest the creation of a special improvement district or a rural improvement district for capital
26 improvement projects that does not identify the specific capital improvements for which protest is being waived.
27 A waiver of a right to protest may not be valid for a time period longer than 20 years after the date that the final
28 subdivision plat is filed with the county clerk and recorder.

69th Legislature 2025 HB0681.4
1 (8) A governing body may not approve a proposed subdivision if any of the features and
2 improvements of the subdivision encroach onto adjoining private property in a manner that is not otherwise
3 provided for under chapter 4 or this chapter or if the well isolation zone of any proposed well to be drilled for the
4 proposed subdivision encroaches onto adjoining private property unless the owner of the private property
5 authorizes the encroachment. For the purposes of this section, "well isolation zone" has the meaning provided
6 in 76-4-102.
7 (9) If a federal or state governmental entity submits a written or oral comment or an opinion
8 regarding wildlife, wildlife habitat, or the natural environment relating to a subdivision application for the purpose
9 of assisting a governing body's review, the comment or opinion may be included in the governing body's written
10 statement under 76-3-620 only if the comment or opinion provides scientific information or a published study
11 that supports the comment or opinion. A governmental entity that is or has been involved in an effort to acquire
12 or assist others in acquiring an interest in the real property identified in the subdivision application shall disclose
13 that the entity has been involved in that effort prior to submitting a comment, an opinion, or information as
14 provided in this subsection.
15 (10) Findings of fact by the governing body concerning whether the development of the proposed
16 subdivision meets the requirements of this chapter must be based on the record as a whole. The governing
17 body's findings of fact must be sustained unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful."
18
19 Section 4. Section 76-3-622, MCA, is amended to read:
20 "76-3-622. Water and sanitation information to accompany preliminary plat. (1) Except as
