8 Section 3. Section 76-3-608, MCA, is amended to read:
9 "76-3-608. Criteria for local government review. (1) The basis for the governing body's decision to
10 approve, conditionally approve, or deny a proposed subdivision is whether the subdivision application,
11 preliminary plat, applicable environmental assessment, public hearing, planning board recommendations, or
12 additional information demonstrates that development of the proposed subdivision meets the requirements of
13 this chapter. A governing body may not deny approval of a proposed subdivision based solely on the
14 subdivision's impacts on educational services or based solely on parcels within the subdivision having been
15 designated as wildland-urban interface parcels under 76-13-145.
16 (2) The governing body shall issue written findings of fact that weigh the criteria in subsection (3),
17 as applicable.
18 (3) A subdivision proposal must undergo review for the following primary criteria:
19 (a) except when the governing body has established an exemption pursuant to subsection (6) or
20 except as provided in 76-3-509, 76-3-609(2) or (4), or 76-3-616, the specific, documentable, and clearly defined
21 impact on agriculture, agricultural water user facilities, local services, the natural environment, wildlife, wildlife
22 habitat, and public health and safety, excluding any consideration of whether the proposed subdivision will
23 result in a loss of agricultural soils;
24 (b) compliance with:
25 (i) the survey requirements provided for in part 4 of this chapter;
26 (ii) the local subdivision regulations provided for in part 5 of this chapter; and
27 (iii) the local subdivision review procedure provided for in this part;
28 (c) the provision of easements within and to the proposed subdivision for the location and

1 installation of any planned utilities; and
2 (d) the provision of legal and physical access to each parcel within the proposed subdivision and
3 the required notation of that access on the applicable plat and any instrument of transfer concerning the parcel.
4 (4) The governing body may require the subdivider to design the proposed subdivision to
5 reasonably minimize potentially significant adverse impacts identified through the review required under
6 subsection (3) but may not require a set-aside of land or monetary contribution for the loss of agricultural soils.
7 Pursuant to 76-3-620, the governing body shall issue written findings to justify the reasonable mitigation
8 required under this subsection (4).
9 (5) (a) In reviewing a proposed subdivision under subsection (3) and when requiring mitigation
10 under subsection (4), a governing body may not unreasonably restrict a landowner's ability to develop land, but
11 it is recognized that in some instances the impacts of a proposed development may be deemed unmitigable
12 and will preclude approval of the subdivision.
13 (b) When requiring mitigation under subsection (4) and consistent with 76-3-620, a governing body
14 shall consult with the subdivider and shall give due weight and consideration to the expressed preference of the
15 subdivider.
16 (6) (a) A governing body may conditionally approve or deny a proposed subdivision as a result of
17 the water and sanitation information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 or public comment received pursuant to 76-
18 3-604 on the information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 only if the conditional approval or denial is based on
19 existing subdivision, zoning, or other regulations that the governing body has the authority to enforce.
20 (b) Except for proposed subdivisions served by a hauled water cistern, an adequate municipal
21 facility, or an adequate county water and/or sewer district facility, as defined in 76-4-102, or that are determined
22 to not need water, a governing body may require as a condition of subdivision approval that an applicant obtain
23 approval from the department of natural resources and conservation to appropriate water pursuant to Title 85,
24 chapter 2.
25 (7) A governing body may not require as a condition of subdivision approval that a property owner
26 waive a right to protest the creation of a special improvement district or a rural improvement district for capital
27 improvement projects that does not identify the specific capital improvements for which protest is being waived.
28 A waiver of a right to protest may not be valid for a time period longer than 20 years after the date that the final

1 subdivision plat is filed with the county clerk and recorder.
2 (8) A governing body may not approve a proposed subdivision if any of the features and
3 improvements of the subdivision encroach onto adjoining private property in a manner that is not otherwise
4 provided for under chapter 4 or this chapter or if the well isolation zone of any proposed well to be drilled for the
5 proposed subdivision encroaches onto adjoining private property unless the owner of the private property
6 authorizes the encroachment. For the purposes of this section, "well isolation zone" has the meaning provided
7 in 76-4-102.
8 (9) If a federal or state governmental entity submits a written or oral comment or an opinion
9 regarding wildlife, wildlife habitat, or the natural environment relating to a subdivision application for the purpose
10 of assisting a governing body's review, the comment or opinion may be included in the governing body's written
11 statement under 76-3-620 only if the comment or opinion provides scientific information or a published study
12 that supports the comment or opinion. A governmental entity that is or has been involved in an effort to acquire
13 or assist others in acquiring an interest in the real property identified in the subdivision application shall disclose
14 that the entity has been involved in that effort prior to submitting a comment, an opinion, or information as
15 provided in this subsection.
16 (10) Findings of fact by the governing body concerning whether the development of the proposed
17 subdivision meets the requirements of this chapter must be based on the record as a whole. The governing
18 body's findings of fact must be sustained unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful."
19
20 Section 4. Section 76-3-622, MCA, is amended to read:
21 "76-3-622. Water and sanitation information to accompany preliminary plat. (1) Except as

1 (b) If the reviewing agent or agency determines that information in the application is not sufficient
2 to allow for review of the proposed subdivision, the reviewing agent or agency shall identify the insufficient
3 information in its notification.
4 (c) A determination that an application contains sufficient information for review as provided in this
5 subsection (2) does not ensure that the proposed subdivision will be approved or conditionally approved by the
6 governing body and does not limit the ability of the reviewing agent or agency or the governing body to request
7 additional information during the review process.
8 (3) The time limits provided in subsections (1) and (2) apply to each submittal of the application
9 until:
10 (a) a determination is made that the application contains the required elements and sufficient
11 information; and
12 (b) the subdivider or the subdivider's agent is notified.
13 (4) After the reviewing agent or agency has notified the subdivider or the subdivider's agent that an

1 (7) (a) The governing body shall collect public comment submitted at a hearing or hearings
2 regarding the information presented pursuant to 76-3-622 and shall make any comments submitted or a

7 (i) reviewing authority provided for in Title 76, chapter 4, for subdivisions that will create one or
8 more parcels containing less than 20 acres; and

12 acres, the governing body may require approval by the department of environmental quality as a condition of
13 approval of the final plat.
14 (b) For a proposed subdivision that will create one or more parcels containing 20 acres or more,
15 the governing body may condition approval of the final plat upon the subdivider demonstrating, pursuant to 76-
16 3-622, that there is an adequate water source and at least one area for a septic system and a replacement
17 drainfield for each lot.
18 (c) Except for lots served by a hauled water cistern, an adequate municipal facility, or an adequate
19 county water and/or sewer district facility, as defined in 76-4-102, or that are determined to not need water, a
20 determination may be made that an application for a proposed subdivision contains the required elements and
21 sufficient information for review if the applicant demonstrates that each lot has:

1 (b) If regulations change during the review periods provided in subsections (1) and (2), the
2 determination of whether the application contains the required elements and sufficient information must be
3 based on the new regulations.
4 (10) Unless otherwise provided by law, the governing body may review but does not have approval
5 authority of the governing documents of the subdivision or amendments to the governing documents unless the
6 governing documents directly and materially impact a condition of subdivision approval."

8 Section 3. Section 76-3-608, MCA, is amended to read:
9 "76-3-608. Criteria for local government review. (1) The basis for the governing body's decision to
10 approve, conditionally approve, or deny a proposed subdivision is whether the subdivision application,
11 preliminary plat, applicable environmental assessment, public hearing, planning board recommendations, or
12 additional information demonstrates that development of the proposed subdivision meets the requirements of
13 this chapter. A governing body may not deny approval of a proposed subdivision based solely on the
14 subdivision's impacts on educational services or based solely on parcels within the subdivision having been
15 designated as wildland-urban interface parcels under 76-13-145.
16 (2) The governing body shall issue written findings of fact that weigh the criteria in subsection (3),
17 as applicable.
18 (3) A subdivision proposal must undergo review for the following primary criteria:
19 (a) except when the governing body has established an exemption pursuant to subsection (6) or
20 except as provided in 76-3-509, 76-3-609(2) or (4), or 76-3-616, the specific, documentable, and clearly defined
21 impact on agriculture, agricultural water user facilities, local services, the natural environment, wildlife, wildlife
22 habitat, and public health and safety, excluding any consideration of whether the proposed subdivision will
23 result in a loss of agricultural soils;
24 (b) compliance with:
25 (i) the survey requirements provided for in part 4 of this chapter;
26 (ii) the local subdivision regulations provided for in part 5 of this chapter; and
27 (iii) the local subdivision review procedure provided for in this part;
28 (c) the provision of easements within and to the proposed subdivision for the location and

1 installation of any planned utilities; and
2 (d) the provision of legal and physical access to each parcel within the proposed subdivision and
3 the required notation of that access on the applicable plat and any instrument of transfer concerning the parcel.
4 (4) The governing body may require the subdivider to design the proposed subdivision to
5 reasonably minimize potentially significant adverse impacts identified through the review required under
6 subsection (3) but may not require a set-aside of land or monetary contribution for the loss of agricultural soils.
7 Pursuant to 76-3-620, the governing body shall issue written findings to justify the reasonable mitigation
8 required under this subsection (4).
9 (5) (a) In reviewing a proposed subdivision under subsection (3) and when requiring mitigation
10 under subsection (4), a governing body may not unreasonably restrict a landowner's ability to develop land, but
11 it is recognized that in some instances the impacts of a proposed development may be deemed unmitigable
12 and will preclude approval of the subdivision.
13 (b) When requiring mitigation under subsection (4) and consistent with 76-3-620, a governing body
14 shall consult with the subdivider and shall give due weight and consideration to the expressed preference of the
15 subdivider.
16 (6) (a) A governing body may conditionally approve or deny a proposed subdivision as a result of
17 the water and sanitation information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 or public comment received pursuant to 76-
18 3-604 on the information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 only if the conditional approval or denial is based on
19 existing subdivision, zoning, or other regulations that the governing body has the authority to enforce.
20 (b) Except for proposed subdivisions served by a hauled water cistern, an adequate municipal
21 facility, or an adequate county water and/or sewer district facility, as defined in 76-4-102, or that are determined
22 to not need water, a governing body may require as a condition of subdivision approval that an applicant obtain
23 approval from the department of natural resources and conservation to appropriate water pursuant to Title 85,
24 chapter 2.
25 (7) A governing body may not require as a condition of subdivision approval that a property owner
26 waive a right to protest the creation of a special improvement district or a rural improvement district for capital
27 improvement projects that does not identify the specific capital improvements for which protest is being waived.
28 A waiver of a right to protest may not be valid for a time period longer than 20 years after the date that the final

1 subdivision plat is filed with the county clerk and recorder.
2 (8) A governing body may not approve a proposed subdivision if any of the features and
3 improvements of the subdivision encroach onto adjoining private property in a manner that is not otherwise
4 provided for under chapter 4 or this chapter or if the well isolation zone of any proposed well to be drilled for the
5 proposed subdivision encroaches onto adjoining private property unless the owner of the private property
6 authorizes the encroachment. For the purposes of this section, "well isolation zone" has the meaning provided
7 in 76-4-102.
8 (9) If a federal or state governmental entity submits a written or oral comment or an opinion
9 regarding wildlife, wildlife habitat, or the natural environment relating to a subdivision application for the purpose
10 of assisting a governing body's review, the comment or opinion may be included in the governing body's written
11 statement under 76-3-620 only if the comment or opinion provides scientific information or a published study
12 that supports the comment or opinion. A governmental entity that is or has been involved in an effort to acquire
13 or assist others in acquiring an interest in the real property identified in the subdivision application shall disclose
14 that the entity has been involved in that effort prior to submitting a comment, an opinion, or information as
15 provided in this subsection.
16 (10) Findings of fact by the governing body concerning whether the development of the proposed
17 subdivision meets the requirements of this chapter must be based on the record as a whole. The governing
18 body's findings of fact must be sustained unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful."
19
20 Section 4. Section 76-3-622, MCA, is amended to read:
21 "76-3-622. Water and sanitation information to accompany preliminary plat. (1) Except as
22 provided in subsection (2), the subdivider shall submit to the governing body or to the agent or agency
23 designated by the governing body the information listed in this section for proposed subdivisions that will
24 include new water supply or wastewater facilities. The information must include:
25 (a) a vicinity map or plan that shows:

7 environmental quality;
8 (F) for parcels less than 20 acres, mixing zones identified as provided in subsection (1)(g) (1)(h);
9 and
10 (G) the representative drainfield site used for the soil profile description as required under
11 subsection (1)(d); and

13 water and sewer facilities;
14 (b) a description of the proposed subdivision's water supply systems, storm water systems, solid
15 waste disposal systems, and wastewater treatment systems, including:
16 (i) whether the water supply and wastewater treatment systems are individual, shared, multiple
17 user, or public as those systems are defined in rules published by the department of environmental quality; and
18 (ii) if the water supply and wastewater treatment systems are shared, multiple user, or public, a
19 statement of whether the systems will be public utilities as defined in 69-3-101 and subject to the jurisdiction of

21 explanation for the exemption;
22 (c) a drawing of the conceptual lot layout at a scale no smaller than 1 inch equal to 200 feet that
23 shows all information required for a lot layout document in rules adopted by the department of environmental
24 quality pursuant to 76-4-104;
25 (d) evidence of suitability for new onsite wastewater treatment systems that, at a minimum,

6 of the natural ground surface, evidence that the ground water will not exceed the minimum vertical separation
7 distance provided in subsection (1)(d)(ii);
8 (e) for new water supply systems, unless cisterns are proposed, evidence of adequate water
9 availability:
10 (i) obtained from well logs or testing of onsite or nearby wells;
