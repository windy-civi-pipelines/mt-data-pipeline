11 filing of a notice, as provided in subsection (3), or the date of the filing of the claim of existing water right.
12 (5) An appropriation under subsection (4) is an existing right, and a permit is not required.

1 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
2 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
3 of other appropriators.
4 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
5 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
6 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
7 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
