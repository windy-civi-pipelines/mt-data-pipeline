wildland fire, or the lack of water, drainage, access, transportation, or other public services or that would
necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of the services.
(2) Any action that is not specifically prohibited in the conditions of subdivision approval is
specifically allowed or is otherwise subject to additional restrictions that may be provided in the governing
documents of the subdivision and applicable zoning regulations.
(3) If a local government has historically interpreted and enforced or chosen not to enforce a
condition of subdivision approval to the benefit of a parcel owner, the local government may not undertake a
different interpretation or enforcement action against a similarly situated parcel owner in the same subdivision.
(4) A review and decision made by a governing body under the authority of this chapter:
(a) relates specifically and only to the criteria for review and authority provided in this chapter; and
(b) is not constrained, influenced, or restricted by a decision made by a state agency or entity

reviewing agent or agency and when accompanied by the review fee submitted as provided in 76-3-602.
(b) Within 5 working days of receipt of a subdivision application, the reviewing agent or agency
shall determine whether the application contains all of the listed materials as required by 76-3-504(1)(a) and
shall notify the subdivider or, with the subdivider's written permission, the subdivider's agent of the reviewing
agent's or agency's determination. If the reviewing agent or agency determines that elements are missing from
the application, the reviewing agent or agency shall identify those elements in the notification.
(2) (a) Within 15 working days after the reviewing agent or agency notifies the subdivider or the
subdivider's agent that the application contains all of the required elements as provided in subsection (1), the
reviewing agent or agency shall determine whether the application and required elements contain detailed,
supporting information that is sufficient to allow for the review of the proposed subdivision under the provisions
of this chapter and the local regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter and shall notify the subdivider or, with
the subdivider's written permission, the subdivider's agent of the reviewing agent's or agency's determination.

69th Legislature 2025 HB 681
(b) If the reviewing agent or agency determines that information in the application is not sufficient
to allow for review of the proposed subdivision, the reviewing agent or agency shall identify the insufficient
information in its notification.
(c) A determination that an application contains sufficient information for review as provided in this
subsection (2) does not ensure that the proposed subdivision will be approved or conditionally approved by the
governing body and does not limit the ability of the reviewing agent or agency or the governing body to request
additional information during the review process.
(3) The time limits provided in subsections (1) and (2) apply to each submittal of the application
until:
(a) a determination is made that the application contains the required elements and sufficient
information; and
(b) the subdivider or the subdivider's agent is notified.
(4) After the reviewing agent or agency has notified the subdivider or the subdivider's agent that an
application contains sufficient information as provided in subsection (2), the governing body shall approve,
conditionally approve, or deny the proposed subdivision within 60 working days or 80 working days if the
proposed subdivision contains 50 or more lots, based on its determination of whether the application conforms
to the provisions of this chapter and to the local regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter, unless:
(a) the subdivider and the reviewing agent or agency agree to an extension or suspension of the
review period, not to exceed 1 year; or
(b) a subsequent public hearing is scheduled and held as provided in 76-3-615.
(5) (a) If the governing body fails to comply with the time limits under subsection (4), the governing
body shall pay to the subdivider a financial penalty of $50 per lot per month or a pro rata portion of a month, not
to exceed the total amount of the subdivision review fee collected by the governing body for the subdivision
application, until the governing body denies, approves, or conditionally approves the subdivision.
(b) The provisions of subsection (5)(a) do not apply if the review period is extended or suspended
pursuant to subsection (4).
(6) If the governing body denies or conditionally approves the proposed subdivision, it shall send
the subdivider a letter, with the appropriate signature, that complies with the provisions of 76-3-620.

regarding the information presented pursuant to 76-3-622 and shall make any comments submitted or a
summary of the comments submitted available to the subdivider within 30 days after conditional approval or
approval of the subdivision application and preliminary plat.
(b) The subdivider shall, as part of the subdivider's application for sanitation approval, forward the
comments or the summary provided by the governing body to the:
(i) reviewing authority provided for in Title 76, chapter 4, for subdivisions that will create one or
more parcels containing less than 20 acres; and
(ii) local health department or board of health for proposed subdivisions that will create one or
more parcels containing 20 acres or more and less than 160 acres.
(8) (a) For a proposed subdivision that will create one or more parcels containing less than 20
acres, the governing body may require approval by the department of environmental quality as a condition of
approval of the final plat.
(b) For a proposed subdivision that will create one or more parcels containing 20 acres or more,
the governing body may condition approval of the final plat upon the subdivider demonstrating, pursuant to 76-
3-622, that there is an adequate water source and at least one area for a septic system and a replacement
drainfield for each lot.
(c) Except for lots served by a hauled water cistern, an adequate municipal facility, or an adequate
county water and/or sewer district facility, as defined in 76-4-102, or that are determined to not need water, a
determination may be made that an application for a proposed subdivision contains the required elements and
sufficient information for review if the applicant demonstrates that each lot has:
(i) a water right under Title 85, chapter 2;
(ii) a completed technical analysis for a permit or change application under Title 85, chapter 2; or
(iii) a notice of intent to appropriate groundwater authorized by the department of natural resources
and conservation pursuant to 85-2-306.
(9) (a) Review and approval, conditional approval, or denial of a proposed subdivision under this
chapter may occur only under those regulations in effect at the time a subdivision application is determined to
contain sufficient information for review as provided in subsection (2).

69th Legislature 2025 HB 681
(b) If regulations change during the review periods provided in subsections (1) and (2), the
determination of whether the application contains the required elements and sufficient information must be
based on the new regulations.
(10) Unless otherwise provided by law, the governing body may review but does not have approval
authority of the governing documents of the subdivision or amendments to the governing documents unless the
governing documents directly and materially impact a condition of subdivision approval."

Section 4:
Section 3. Section 76-3-608, MCA, is amended to read:
"76-3-608. Criteria for local government review. (1) The basis for the governing body's decision to
approve, conditionally approve, or deny a proposed subdivision is whether the subdivision application,
preliminary plat, applicable environmental assessment, public hearing, planning board recommendations, or
additional information demonstrates that development of the proposed subdivision meets the requirements of
this chapter. A governing body may not deny approval of a proposed subdivision based solely on the
subdivision's impacts on educational services or based solely on parcels within the subdivision having been
designated as wildland-urban interface parcels under 76-13-145.
(2) The governing body shall issue written findings of fact that weigh the criteria in subsection (3),
as applicable.
(3) A subdivision proposal must undergo review for the following primary criteria:
(a) except when the governing body has established an exemption pursuant to subsection (6) or
except as provided in 76-3-509, 76-3-609(2) or (4), or 76-3-616, the specific, documentable, and clearly defined
impact on agriculture, agricultural water user facilities, local services, the natural environment, wildlife, wildlife
habitat, and public health and safety, excluding any consideration of whether the proposed subdivision will
result in a loss of agricultural soils;
(b) compliance with:
(i) the survey requirements provided for in part 4 of this chapter;
(ii) the local subdivision regulations provided for in part 5 of this chapter; and
(iii) the local subdivision review procedure provided for in this part;
(c) the provision of easements within and to the proposed subdivision for the location and
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 681
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 681
installation of any planned utilities; and
(d) the provision of legal and physical access to each parcel within the proposed subdivision and
the required notation of that access on the applicable plat and any instrument of transfer concerning the parcel.
(4) The governing body may require the subdivider to design the proposed subdivision to
reasonably minimize potentially significant adverse impacts identified through the review required under
subsection (3) but may not require a set-aside of land or monetary contribution for the loss of agricultural soils.
Pursuant to 76-3-620, the governing body shall issue written findings to justify the reasonable mitigation
required under this subsection (4).
(5) (a) In reviewing a proposed subdivision under subsection (3) and when requiring mitigation
under subsection (4), a governing body may not unreasonably restrict a landowner's ability to develop land, but
it is recognized that in some instances the impacts of a proposed development may be deemed unmitigable
and will preclude approval of the subdivision.
(b) When requiring mitigation under subsection (4) and consistent with 76-3-620, a governing body
shall consult with the subdivider and shall give due weight and consideration to the expressed preference of the
subdivider.
(6) (a) A governing body may conditionally approve or deny a proposed subdivision as a result of
the water and sanitation information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 or public comment received pursuant to 76-
3-604 on the information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 only if the conditional approval or denial is based on
existing subdivision, zoning, or other regulations that the governing body has the authority to enforce.
(b) Except for proposed subdivisions served by a hauled water cistern, an adequate municipal
facility, or an adequate county water and/or sewer district facility, as defined in 76-4-102, or that are determined
to not need water, a governing body may require as a condition of subdivision approval that an applicant obtain
approval from the department of natural resources and conservation to appropriate water pursuant to Title 85,
chapter 2.
(7) A governing body may not require as a condition of subdivision approval that a property owner
waive a right to protest the creation of a special improvement district or a rural improvement district for capital
improvement projects that does not identify the specific capital improvements for which protest is being waived.
A waiver of a right to protest may not be valid for a time period longer than 20 years after the date that the final
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 681
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 681
subdivision plat is filed with the county clerk and recorder.
(8) A governing body may not approve a proposed subdivision if any of the features and
improvements of the subdivision encroach onto adjoining private property in a manner that is not otherwise
provided for under chapter 4 or this chapter or if the well isolation zone of any proposed well to be drilled for the
proposed subdivision encroaches onto adjoining private property unless the owner of the private property
authorizes the encroachment. For the purposes of this section, "well isolation zone" has the meaning provided
in 76-4-102.
(9) If a federal or state governmental entity submits a written or oral comment or an opinion
regarding wildlife, wildlife habitat, or the natural environment relating to a subdivision application for the purpose
of assisting a governing body's review, the comment or opinion may be included in the governing body's written
statement under 76-3-620 only if the comment or opinion provides scientific information or a published study
that supports the comment or opinion. A governmental entity that is or has been involved in an effort to acquire
or assist others in acquiring an interest in the real property identified in the subdivision application shall disclose
that the entity has been involved in that effort prior to submitting a comment, an opinion, or information as
provided in this subsection.
(10) Findings of fact by the governing body concerning whether the development of the proposed
subdivision meets the requirements of this chapter must be based on the record as a whole. The governing
body's findings of fact must be sustained unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful."

Section 5:
Section 4. Section 76-3-622, MCA, is amended to read:
"76-3-622. Water and sanitation information to accompany preliminary plat. (1) Except as
provided in subsection (2), the subdivider shall submit to the governing body or to the agent or agency
designated by the governing body the information listed in this section for proposed subdivisions that will
include new water supply or wastewater facilities. The information must include:
(a) a vicinity map or plan that shows:
(i) the location, within 100 feet outside of the exterior property line of the subdivision and on the

(g)(h) a preliminary analysis of potential impacts to ground water quality from new wastewater
treatment systems, using as guidance rules adopted pursuant to 75-5-301 and 75-5-303 related to standard
mixing zones for ground water, source specific mixing zones, and nonsignificant changes in water quality. The
preliminary analysis may be based on currently available information and must consider the effects of
overlapping mixing zones from proposed and existing wastewater treatment systems within and directly
adjacent to the subdivision. Instead of performing the preliminary analysis required under this subsection
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 681
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 681
(1)(g)(h), the subdivider may perform a complete nondegradation analysis in the same manner as is required
for an application that is reviewed under Title 76, chapter 4.
(2) A subdivider whose land division is excluded from review under 76-4-125(1) is not required to
submit the information required in this section.
(3) A governing body may not, through adoption of regulations, require water and sanitation

permit as prescribed by this part. Subject to subsection (7)(b), upon receipt of a correct and complete
application for a stock water provisional permit, the department shall automatically issue a provisional permit. If
the department determines after a hearing that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely
affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
of other appropriators.
(b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – HB 681
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 681
complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
(8) A person may also appropriate water without applying for or prior to receiving a permit under
rules adopted by the department under 85-2-113.

Section 3. Section 76-3-608, MCA, is amended to read:
"76-3-608. Criteria for local government review. (1) The basis for the governing body's decision to
approve, conditionally approve, or deny a proposed subdivision is whether the subdivision application,
preliminary plat, applicable environmental assessment, public hearing, planning board recommendations, or
additional information demonstrates that development of the proposed subdivision meets the requirements of
this chapter. A governing body may not deny approval of a proposed subdivision based solely on the
subdivision's impacts on educational services or based solely on parcels within the subdivision having been
designated as wildland-urban interface parcels under 76-13-145.
(2) The governing body shall issue written findings of fact that weigh the criteria in subsection (3),
as applicable.
(3) A subdivision proposal must undergo review for the following primary criteria:
(a) except when the governing body has established an exemption pursuant to subsection (6) or
except as provided in 76-3-509, 76-3-609(2) or (4), or 76-3-616, the specific, documentable, and clearly defined
impact on agriculture, agricultural water user facilities, local services, the natural environment, wildlife, wildlife
habitat, and public health and safety, excluding any consideration of whether the proposed subdivision will
result in a loss of agricultural soils;
(b) compliance with:
(i) the survey requirements provided for in part 4 of this chapter;
(ii) the local subdivision regulations provided for in part 5 of this chapter; and
(iii) the local subdivision review procedure provided for in this part;
(c) the provision of easements within and to the proposed subdivision for the location and
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 681
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 681
installation of any planned utilities; and
(d) the provision of legal and physical access to each parcel within the proposed subdivision and
the required notation of that access on the applicable plat and any instrument of transfer concerning the parcel.
(4) The governing body may require the subdivider to design the proposed subdivision to
reasonably minimize potentially significant adverse impacts identified through the review required under
subsection (3) but may not require a set-aside of land or monetary contribution for the loss of agricultural soils.
Pursuant to 76-3-620, the governing body shall issue written findings to justify the reasonable mitigation
required under this subsection (4).
(5) (a) In reviewing a proposed subdivision under subsection (3) and when requiring mitigation
under subsection (4), a governing body may not unreasonably restrict a landowner's ability to develop land, but
it is recognized that in some instances the impacts of a proposed development may be deemed unmitigable
and will preclude approval of the subdivision.
(b) When requiring mitigation under subsection (4) and consistent with 76-3-620, a governing body
shall consult with the subdivider and shall give due weight and consideration to the expressed preference of the
subdivider.
(6) (a) A governing body may conditionally approve or deny a proposed subdivision as a result of
the water and sanitation information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 or public comment received pursuant to 76-
3-604 on the information provided pursuant to 76-3-622 only if the conditional approval or denial is based on
existing subdivision, zoning, or other regulations that the governing body has the authority to enforce.
(b) Except for proposed subdivisions served by a hauled water cistern, an adequate municipal
facility, or an adequate county water and/or sewer district facility, as defined in 76-4-102, or that are determined
to not need water, a governing body may require as a condition of subdivision approval that an applicant obtain
approval from the department of natural resources and conservation to appropriate water pursuant to Title 85,
chapter 2.
(7) A governing body may not require as a condition of subdivision approval that a property owner
waive a right to protest the creation of a special improvement district or a rural improvement district for capital
improvement projects that does not identify the specific capital improvements for which protest is being waived.
A waiver of a right to protest may not be valid for a time period longer than 20 years after the date that the final
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 681

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 681
subdivision plat is filed with the county clerk and recorder.
(8) A governing body may not approve a proposed subdivision if any of the features and
improvements of the subdivision encroach onto adjoining private property in a manner that is not otherwise
provided for under chapter 4 or this chapter or if the well isolation zone of any proposed well to be drilled for the
proposed subdivision encroaches onto adjoining private property unless the owner of the private property
authorizes the encroachment. For the purposes of this section, "well isolation zone" has the meaning provided
in 76-4-102.
(9) If a federal or state governmental entity submits a written or oral comment or an opinion
regarding wildlife, wildlife habitat, or the natural environment relating to a subdivision application for the purpose
of assisting a governing body's review, the comment or opinion may be included in the governing body's written
statement under 76-3-620 only if the comment or opinion provides scientific information or a published study
that supports the comment or opinion. A governmental entity that is or has been involved in an effort to acquire
or assist others in acquiring an interest in the real property identified in the subdivision application shall disclose
that the entity has been involved in that effort prior to submitting a comment, an opinion, or information as
provided in this subsection.
(10) Findings of fact by the governing body concerning whether the development of the proposed
subdivision meets the requirements of this chapter must be based on the record as a whole. The governing
body's findings of fact must be sustained unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful."
Section 4. Section 76-3-622, MCA, is amended to read:
"76-3-622. Water and sanitation information to accompany preliminary plat. (1) Except as
provided in subsection (2), the subdivider shall submit to the governing body or to the agent or agency
designated by the governing body the information listed in this section for proposed subdivisions that will
include new water supply or wastewater facilities. The information must include:
