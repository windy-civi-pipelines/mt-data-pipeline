insurer shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the required aspects of the examination prior to purchase and
disclose that examination documentation may result in a preexisting condition exclusion.
(7) Waiting periods and the requirements applicable to them must be clearly and prominently
disclosed to consumers prior to the policy purchase.
