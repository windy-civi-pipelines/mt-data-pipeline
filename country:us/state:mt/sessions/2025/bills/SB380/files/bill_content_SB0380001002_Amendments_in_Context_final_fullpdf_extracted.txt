9 determining any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol or drugs in the person's body.
10 (2) (a) Except as permitted by law, a person whose license or privilege to drive a motor vehicle on

2 (4) (a) Upon receiving a report of an implied consent violation, the department shall:
3 (i) for a first violation, suspend the driver's license or driving privilege for 6 months with no
4 provision for a restricted probationary license; or
5 (ii) for a second or subsequent violation within 5 years of a previous refusal, as determined from
6 the records of the department, suspend the driver's license or driving privilege for 1 year with no provision for a
7 restricted probationary license.
8 (b) If a person who refuses to submit to one or more tests under this section is the holder of a
9 commercial driver's license, in addition to any action taken against the driver's noncommercial driving
10 privileges, the department shall:
11 (i) upon a first refusal, suspend the person's commercial driver's license for 1 year; and
12 (ii) upon a second or subsequent refusal, suspend the person's commercial driver's license for life,
13 subject to department rules adopted to implement federal rules allowing for license reinstatement, if the person
14 is otherwise eligible, upon completion of a minimum suspension period of 10 years. If the person has a prior
15 conviction of a major offense listed in 61-8-802(2) arising from a separate incident, the conviction has the same
16 effect as a previous testing refusal.
17 (5) A nonresident driver's license seized under this section must be sent by the department to the
18 licensing authority of the nonresident's home state with a report of the nonresident's refusal to submit to one or
19 more tests.
20 (6) The department may recognize the seizure of a license of a tribal member by a peace officer
21 acting under the authority of a tribal government or an order issued by a tribal court suspending, revoking, or
22 reinstating a license or adjudicating a license seizure if the actions are conducted pursuant to tribal law or
23 regulation requiring alcohol or drug testing of motor vehicle operators and the conduct giving rise to the actions
24 occurred within the exterior boundaries of a federally recognized Indian reservation in this state. Action by the
25 department under this subsection is not reviewable under 61-8-1017."
