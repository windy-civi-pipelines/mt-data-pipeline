10 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Coal severance tax bonds authorized. (1) The legislature finds that
11 Title 17, chapter 5, part 7, provides for the issuance of coal severance tax bonds for financing specific,
12 approved, renewable resource projects as part of the state renewable resource grant and loan program.
13 Available funds from previous sales of coal severance tax bonds, plus any additional principal amount on bonds
14 as may be necessary, pursuant to the conditions described in 85-1-605, to fund emergency loans, as
15 authorized and approved in accordance with 85-1-605(4), may also be used for the projects approved in
16 [sections 1 and 2]. The board of examiners is authorized to issue coal severance tax bonds in an amount not to
17 exceed $121,198,444 in the biennium beginning July 1, 2025, of which up to $12,119,844 is to be used to
18 establish a reserve for the bonds. Proceeds of the bonds are appropriated to the department of natural
19 resources and conservation for financing the projects identified in [sections 1 and 2] and may be used as
20 authorized in 85-1-605(4). Loans made under 85-1-605(4) must bear interest at the rate borne by the state
21 bonds unless the legislature in a subsequent session provides for a lower interest rate, in which case the rate
22 must be reduced to the rate specified by the legislature.
23 (2) In connection with the issuance of coal severance tax bonds, the board of examiners may pay
24 the principal and interest on the bonds when due from the debt service account and in all other respects
25 manage and use the funds within each special bond account for the benefit of the bonds. The board of
26 examiners shall exercise its discretion to enhance the marketability of the bonds and to secure the most
27 advantageous financial arrangements for the state.
28 (3) Earnings on the bond proceeds prior to the completion of any loan must be allocated to the

1 debt service account to pay the debt service on the bonds during this period. Earnings in excess of debt
2 service, if any, must be allocated to the natural resources projects state special revenue account established in
3 15-38-302.
4 (4) Loan repayments from loans financed with coal severance tax bonds are pledged, dedicated,
5 and appropriated to the debt service account in the state treasury for the benefit of bonds approved for loans
6 under this section.

8 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Condition of loans. (1) Disbursement of funds under [sections 1 through
9 3] for loans is subject to the following conditions that must be met by project sponsors:
10 (a) approval of a scope of work and budget for the project by the department of natural resources
11 and conservation. Reductions in a scope of work or budget may not affect priority activities or improvements.
12 (b) documented commitment of other funds required for project completion;
13 (c) satisfactory completion of conditions described in the recommendations section of the project

16 (e) completion of other specific requirements considered necessary by the department of natural
17 resources and conservation to accomplish the purpose of the loan as evidenced from the application to the
18 department or from the proposal to the legislature.
19 (2) Each sponsor authorized for a loan from coal severance tax bond proceeds may be required to
20 pay to the department of natural resources and conservation a pro rata share of the bond issuance costs and
21 the administrative costs incurred by the department to complete the loan transaction.
22
23 NEW SECTION. Section 5. Private and discount purchase of loans. Loans to political subdivisions
24 and local government entities pursuant to [sections 1 through 3] and bonds, warrants, and notes issued in
25 evidence of those loans may be made, purchased by, and sold to the department of natural resources and
