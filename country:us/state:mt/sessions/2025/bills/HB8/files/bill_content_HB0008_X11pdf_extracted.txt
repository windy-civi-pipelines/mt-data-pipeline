Section 3. Coal severance tax bonds authorized. (1) The legislature finds that Title 17, chapter 5,
part 7, provides for the issuance of coal severance tax bonds for financing specific, approved, renewable
resource projects as part of the state renewable resource grant and loan program. Available funds from
previous sales of coal severance tax bonds, plus any additional principal amount on bonds as may be
necessary, pursuant to the conditions described in 85-1-605, to fund emergency loans, as authorized and
approved in accordance with 85-1-605(4), may also be used for the projects approved in [sections 1 and 2].
The board of examiners is authorized to issue coal severance tax bonds in an amount not to exceed
$121,198,444 in the biennium beginning July 1, 2025, of which up to $12,119,844 is to be used to establish a
reserve for the bonds. Proceeds of the bonds are appropriated to the department of natural resources and
conservation for financing the projects identified in [sections 1 and 2] and may be used as authorized in 85-1-
605(4). Loans made under 85-1-605(4) must bear interest at the rate borne by the state bonds unless the
legislature in a subsequent session provides for a lower interest rate, in which case the rate must be reduced to
the rate specified by the legislature.
(2) In connection with the issuance of coal severance tax bonds, the board of examiners may pay
the principal and interest on the bonds when due from the debt service account and in all other respects
manage and use the funds within each special bond account for the benefit of the bonds. The board of
examiners shall exercise its discretion to enhance the marketability of the bonds and to secure the most
advantageous financial arrangements for the state.
(3) Earnings on the bond proceeds prior to the completion of any loan must be allocated to the
debt service account to pay the debt service on the bonds during this period. Earnings in excess of debt
service, if any, must be allocated to the natural resources projects state special revenue account established in
15-38-302.

Section 5:
Section 4. Condition of loans. (1) Disbursement of funds under [sections 1 through 3] for loans is
subject to the following conditions that must be met by project sponsors:
(a) approval of a scope of work and budget for the project by the department of natural resources
and conservation. Reductions in a scope of work or budget may not affect priority activities or improvements.

(2) Each sponsor authorized for a loan from coal severance tax bond proceeds may be required to
pay to the department of natural resources and conservation a pro rata share of the bond issuance costs and
the administrative costs incurred by the department to complete the loan transaction.

government entities pursuant to [sections 1 through 3] and bonds, warrants, and notes issued in evidence of
those loans may be made, purchased by, and sold to the department of natural resources and conservation at
a discount and at a private negotiated sale, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law applicable to
political subdivisions or local government entities.

Section 7:
Section 6. Appropriations established. For any entity of state government that receives a loan
under [sections 1 through 3], an appropriation is established for the amount of the loan upon award of the loan
