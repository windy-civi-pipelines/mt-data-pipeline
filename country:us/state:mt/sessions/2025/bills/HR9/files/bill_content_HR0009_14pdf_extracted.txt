5 PARDON OF DEREK CHAUVIN, INVESTIGATIONS INTO JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT, AND THE RETURN OF
6 SETTLEMENT FUNDS.
7
8 WHEREAS, Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was convicted of federal and state
9 charges in connection with the death of George Floyd in May 2020; and
10 WHEREAS, the Montana House of Representatives believes that Derek Chauvin is innocent of the
11 charges brought against him and that the convictions were based on insufficient evidence and improper legal
12 proceedings; and
13 WHEREAS, George Floyd had a documented criminal history, including multiple convictions for
14 offenses such as theft, drug possession, and armed robbery, which raises questions about the narrative
15 surrounding the events of May 25, 2020; and
16 WHEREAS, evidence from the incident indicates that George Floyd stated "I can’t breathe" prior to
17 being restrained by Officer Chauvin, suggesting that his medical distress may have been influenced by factors
18 unrelated to the officer's actions; and
19 WHEREAS, toxicology reports confirmed that George Floyd had fentanyl and other substances in his
20 system at the time of his death, which may have contributed significantly to his medical distress and ultimate
21 demise; and
22 WHEREAS, the federal and state prosecutions of Derek Chauvin were driven by political motivations,
23 with activist groups and elected officials exploiting the case to advance partisan agendas, thereby undermining
24 the impartial administration of justice; and
25 WHEREAS, the mainstream media's sensationalized and biased coverage of the events of May 25,
26 2020, created a prejudiced public narrative that vilified Derek Chauvin, effectively denying him a fair trial by
27 tainting the jury pool and public perception; and
28 WHEREAS, the violent riots and property destruction orchestrated by groups such as Black Lives

69th Legislature 2025 HR 9.1
1 Matter and Antifa constituted acts of domestic terrorism, designed to intimidate the judiciary and coerce the jury
2 into delivering an unjust verdict against Derek Chauvin; and
3 WHEREAS, Derek Chauvin’s convictions reflect a disturbing trend of law enforcement officers being
4 unjustly targeted and scapegoated to appease public unrest, undermining the ability of police to protect
5 communities; and
6 WHEREAS, the City of Minneapolis's decision to pay a $27 million settlement to George Floyd's family
7 was premature and unjustified, given the questionable circumstances of the case and Derek Chauvin's
8 innocence, and those funds should be returned to the city to restore public trust and fiscal responsibility; and
9 WHEREAS, concerns have been raised regarding the fairness of the legal proceedings, including the
10 influence of public, media, and political pressures, which collectively compromised the integrity of the judicial
11 process; and
12 WHEREAS, the Montana House of Representatives believes that a thorough investigation into the
13 handling of Derek Chauvin's case is necessary to uncover any misconduct, bias, or external pressures that led
14 to his wrongful convictions; and
15 WHEREAS, the Montana House of Representatives believes that justice must be administered without
16 bias and that convictions driven by external pressures and questionable grounds erode public trust in the
17 judicial system; and
18 WHEREAS, the power of executive clemency exists to correct potential injustices and restore fairness
19 in cases where convictions lack sufficient merit; and
20 WHEREAS, President Donald J. Trump has the authority to grant pardons for federal offenses, and
21 Governor Tim Walz has the authority to grant pardons for state offenses in Minnesota; and
22 WHEREAS, the Montana House of Representatives seeks to urge the exercise of clemency to address
23 the wrongful convictions of Derek Chauvin, demand accountability for systemic failures in the judicial process,
24 and rectify the misuse of public funds.
25
26 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
27 MONTANA:
28 That the Montana House of Representatives respectfully urges:
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – HR 9
69th Legislature 2025 HR 9.1
1 (1) President Donald J. Trump to exercise his constitutional authority to grant a full and
2 unconditional pardon to Derek Chauvin for all federal charges and convictions related to the events of May 25,
3 2020, which are believed to be baseless, unjust, and the result of a compromised judicial process; and
4 (2) Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota to exercise his authority to grant a full and unconditional
5 pardon to Derek Chauvin for all state charges and convictions related to the events of May 25, 2020, which are
6 believed to be baseless, unjust, and the result of a compromised judicial process.
7 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Montana House of Representatives:
8 (1) affirms its belief in Derek Chauvin's innocence, noting George Floyd's criminal history, his
9 statements of "I can’t breathe" prior to restraint, and the presence of fentanyl and other substances in his
10 system as critical context that challenges the validity of the charges against Chauvin;
11 (2) condemns the political motivations, biased media coverage, and acts of domestic terrorism by
12 groups such as Black Lives Matter and Antifa, which collectively pressured the judicial system and led to an
13 unfair verdict;
14 (3) decries the broader trend of persecuting law enforcement officers like Derek Chauvin to placate
15 public unrest, which undermines public safety and the rule of law;
16 (4) urges the City of Minneapolis to demand the return of the $27 million settlement paid to George
17 Floyd's family, because the payment was based on a flawed narrative and constitutes an irresponsible use of
18 taxpayer funds in light of Derek Chauvin's innocence;
19 (5) calls for a thorough and independent investigation into the handling of Derek Chauvin's federal
20 and state prosecutions to uncover any misconduct, bias, or external pressures that compromised the judicial
21 process, and urges Congress and the Minnesota Legislature to initiate these investigations to restore public
22 trust in the justice system; and
23 (6) reaffirms its commitment to the principles of justice, fairness, and the rule of law and believes
24 that these pardons and investigations and the return of settlement funds would serve the cause of justice and
25 restore public confidence in the legal system.
26 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State of Montana send a copy of this resolution to
27 President Donald J. Trump, Governor Tim Walz, Derek Chauvin, the Speaker of the United States House of
28 Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, the Minnesota Secretary of State, the leadership of
