be of a size and scale determined by the department.
(d) if the small miner's operations are placer or dredge mining, that the small miner shall salvage
and protect all soil materials for use in reclamation of that site and shall reclaim all land disturbed by the
operations to comparable utility and stability as that of adjacent areas.
(2) For small-miner exemptions obtained after September 30, 1985, a small miner may not obtain
or continue an exemption under subsection (1) unless the small miner annually certifies in writing:
(a) if the small miner is an individual, that:
(i) no business association or partnership of which the small miner is a member or partner has a
small-miner exemption; and
(ii) no corporation of which the small miner is an officer, director, or owner of record of 25% or
more of any class of voting stock has a small-miner exemption; or

(3) A small miner whose operations are placer or dredge mining shall post a performance bond
equal to the state's documented cost estimate of reclaiming the disturbed land, although the bond may not
exceed $10,000 for each operation. If the small miner has posted a bond for reclamation with another
government agency, the small miner is exempt from the requirement of this subsection.
(4) If a small miner who conducts a placer or dredge mining operation fails to reclaim the
operation, the small miner is liable to the department for all of its reasonable costs of reclamation, including a

reasonable charge for services performed by state personnel and for state materials and equipment used. If the
small miner posts a surety bond, the surety is liable to the state to the extent of the bond amount and the small
miner is liable for the remainder of the reasonable costs to the state of reclaiming the operation.
(5) If a small miner who conducts a placer or dredge mining operation fails to commence
reclamation of the operation within 6 months after cessation of mining or within an extended period allowed by
the department for good cause shown or if the small miner fails to diligently complete reclamation, the
department shall notify the small miner by certified mail that it intends to reclaim the operation unless the small
miner commences reclamation within 30 days and diligently completes the reclamation. The notice must be
mailed to the address stated on the small miner exclusion statement or, if the small miner has notified the
department of a different address by letter or in the annual certification form, to the most recent address given
to the department. If the small miner fails to commence reclamation within 30 days or to diligently complete
reclamation, the department may revoke the small miner exclusion statement, forfeit any bond that has been
posted with the department, and enter and reclaim the operation. If the small miner has not posted a bond with
the department or if the reasonable costs of reclamation exceed the amount of the bond, the department may
also collect additional reclamation costs, as set forth in subsection (6), before or after it incurs those costs.
(6) To collect additional reclamation costs, the department shall notify the small miner by certified
mail, at the address determined under subsection (5), of the additional reasonable reclamation costs and
request payment within 30 days. If the small miner does not pay the additional reclamation costs within 30
days, the department may bring an action in district court for payment of the estimated future costs and, if the
department has performed any reclamation, of its reasonable actual costs. The court shall order payment of
costs that it determines to be reasonable and shall retain jurisdiction until reclamation of the operation is
completed. Upon completion of reclamation, the court shall order payment of any additional costs that it
considers reasonable or the refund of any portion of any payment for estimated costs that exceeds the actual
reasonable costs incurred by the department.

to the department for all of its reasonable costs of reclamation, including a reasonable charge for services
performed by state personnel and for state materials and equipment used. If the small miner posts a surety
bond, the surety is liable to the state to the extent of the bond amount and the small miner is liable for the
remainder of the reasonable costs to the state of reclaiming the operation.
(d) If a small miner under this subsection (8) fails to commence reclamation of the operation within
6 months after cessation of mining or within an extended period allowed by the department for good cause
shown or if the small miner fails to diligently complete reclamation, the department shall notify the small miner
by certified mail that it intends to reclaim the operation unless the small miner commences reclamation within
30 days and diligently completes the reclamation. The notice must be mailed to the address stated on the small
miner exclusion statement or, if the small miner has notified the department of a different address by letter or in
the annual certification form, to the most recent address given to the department. If the small miner fails to

be of a size and scale determined by the department.
(d) if the small miner's operations are placer or dredge mining, that the small miner shall salvage
and protect all soil materials for use in reclamation of that site and shall reclaim all land disturbed by the
operations to comparable utility and stability as that of adjacent areas.
(2) For small-miner exemptions obtained after September 30, 1985, a small miner may not obtain
or continue an exemption under subsection (1) unless the small miner annually certifies in writing:
(a) if the small miner is an individual, that:
(i) no business association or partnership of which the small miner is a member or partner has a

(3) A small miner whose operations are placer or dredge mining shall post a performance bond
equal to the state's documented cost estimate of reclaiming the disturbed land, although the bond may not
exceed $10,000 for each operation. If the small miner has posted a bond for reclamation with another
government agency, the small miner is exempt from the requirement of this subsection.
(4) If a small miner who conducts a placer or dredge mining operation fails to reclaim the
operation, the small miner is liable to the department for all of its reasonable costs of reclamation, including a

reasonable charge for services performed by state personnel and for state materials and equipment used. If the
small miner posts a surety bond, the surety is liable to the state to the extent of the bond amount and the small
miner is liable for the remainder of the reasonable costs to the state of reclaiming the operation.
(5) If a small miner who conducts a placer or dredge mining operation fails to commence
reclamation of the operation within 6 months after cessation of mining or within an extended period allowed by
the department for good cause shown or if the small miner fails to diligently complete reclamation, the
department shall notify the small miner by certified mail that it intends to reclaim the operation unless the small
miner commences reclamation within 30 days and diligently completes the reclamation. The notice must be
mailed to the address stated on the small miner exclusion statement or, if the small miner has notified the
department of a different address by letter or in the annual certification form, to the most recent address given

reclamation, the department may revoke the small miner exclusion statement, forfeit any bond that has been
posted with the department, and enter and reclaim the operation. If the small miner has not posted a bond with
the department or if the reasonable costs of reclamation exceed the amount of the bond, the department may
also collect additional reclamation costs, as set forth in subsection (6), before or after it incurs those costs.
(6) To collect additional reclamation costs, the department shall notify the small miner by certified
mail, at the address determined under subsection (5), of the additional reasonable reclamation costs and
request payment within 30 days. If the small miner does not pay the additional reclamation costs within 30
days, the department may bring an action in district court for payment of the estimated future costs and, if the
department has performed any reclamation, of its reasonable actual costs. The court shall order payment of
costs that it determines to be reasonable and shall retain jurisdiction until reclamation of the operation is
completed. Upon completion of reclamation, the court shall order payment of any additional costs that it
considers reasonable or the refund of any portion of any payment for estimated costs that exceeds the actual
reasonable costs incurred by the department.

miner who intends to use an impoundment to store waste from ore processing shall obtain approval for the
design, construction, operation, and reclamation of that impoundment and post a performance bond for that
part of the small miner's operation before constructing an impoundment. The small miner shall post a
performance bond equal to the state's documented cost estimate of reclaiming the disturbed land. If the small
miner has posted a bond for reclamation of that site with a federal government agency, the small miner is
exempt from the requirements of this subsection (8)(a).
(b) The department shall conduct a review of the adequacy of the bond posted by a small miner
using an impoundment pursuant to this section at least once every 5 years and adjust the bond if necessary to

to the department for all of its reasonable costs of reclamation, including a reasonable charge for services
performed by state personnel and for state materials and equipment used. If the small miner posts a surety
bond, the surety is liable to the state to the extent of the bond amount and the small miner is liable for the
