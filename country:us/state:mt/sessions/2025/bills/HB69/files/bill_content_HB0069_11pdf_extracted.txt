4 operations to comparable utility and stability as that of adjacent areas.
5 (2) For small-miner exemptions obtained after September 30, 1985, a small miner may not obtain
6 or continue an exemption under subsection (1) unless the small miner annually certifies in writing:
7 (a) if the small miner is an individual, that:
8 (i) no business association or partnership of which the small miner is a member or partner has a
9 small-miner exemption; and
10 (ii) no corporation of which the small miner is an officer, director, or owner of record of 25% or

2 small miner posts a surety bond, the surety is liable to the state to the extent of the bond amount and the small
3 miner is liable for the remainder of the reasonable costs to the state of reclaiming the operation.
4 (5) If a small miner who conducts a placer or dredge mining operation fails to commence
5 reclamation of the operation within 6 months after cessation of mining or within an extended period allowed by
6 the department for good cause shown or if the small miner fails to diligently complete reclamation, the
7 department shall notify the small miner by certified mail that it intends to reclaim the operation unless the small
8 miner commences reclamation within 30 days and diligently completes the reclamation. The notice must be
9 mailed to the address stated on the small miner exclusion statement or, if the small miner has notified the
10 department of a different address by letter or in the annual certification form, to the most recent address given
11 to the department. If the small miner fails to commence reclamation within 30 days or to diligently complete
12 reclamation, the department may revoke the small miner exclusion statement, forfeit any bond that has been
13 posted with the department, and enter and reclaim the operation. If the small miner has not posted a bond with
14 the department or if the reasonable costs of reclamation exceed the amount of the bond, the department may
15 also collect additional reclamation costs, as set forth in subsection (6), before or after it incurs those costs.
16 (6) To collect additional reclamation costs, the department shall notify the small miner by certified
17 mail, at the address determined under subsection (5), of the additional reasonable reclamation costs and

18 bond, the surety is liable to the state to the extent of the bond amount and the small miner is liable for the
19 remainder of the reasonable costs to the state of reclaiming the operation.
20 (d) If a small miner under this subsection (8) fails to commence reclamation of the operation within
21 6 months after cessation of mining or within an extended period allowed by the department for good cause
22 shown or if the small miner fails to diligently complete reclamation, the department shall notify the small miner
23 by certified mail that it intends to reclaim the operation unless the small miner commences reclamation within
24 30 days and diligently completes the reclamation. The notice must be mailed to the address stated on the small
25 miner exclusion statement or, if the small miner has notified the department of a different address by letter or in
26 the annual certification form, to the most recent address given to the department. If the small miner fails to

22 "82-4-305. Exemption -- small miners -- written agreement. (1) Except as provided in subsections
23 (3) through (11) (12), the provisions of this part do not apply to a small miner if the small miner annually submits
24 a $100 administrative fee and agrees in writing:

1 be of a size and scale determined by the department.
2 (d) if the small miner's operations are placer or dredge mining, that the small miner shall salvage
3 and protect all soil materials for use in reclamation of that site and shall reclaim all land disturbed by the
4 operations to comparable utility and stability as that of adjacent areas.
5 (2) For small-miner exemptions obtained after September 30, 1985, a small miner may not obtain
6 or continue an exemption under subsection (1) unless the small miner annually certifies in writing:
7 (a) if the small miner is an individual, that:
8 (i) no business association or partnership of which the small miner is a member or partner has a
9 small-miner exemption; and
10 (ii) no corporation of which the small miner is an officer, director, or owner of record of 25% or
11 more of any class of voting stock has a small-miner exemption; or

23 (3) A small miner whose operations are placer or dredge mining shall post a performance bond
24 equal to the state's documented cost estimate of reclaiming the disturbed land, although the bond may not
25 exceed $10,000 for each operation. If the small miner has posted a bond for reclamation with another
26 government agency, the small miner is exempt from the requirement of this subsection.
27 (4) If a small miner who conducts a placer or dredge mining operation fails to reclaim the
28 operation, the small miner is liable to the department for all of its reasonable costs of reclamation, including a

69th Legislature 2025 HB 69.1
1 reasonable charge for services performed by state personnel and for state materials and equipment used. If the
2 small miner posts a surety bond, the surety is liable to the state to the extent of the bond amount and the small
3 miner is liable for the remainder of the reasonable costs to the state of reclaiming the operation.
4 (5) If a small miner who conducts a placer or dredge mining operation fails to commence
5 reclamation of the operation within 6 months after cessation of mining or within an extended period allowed by
6 the department for good cause shown or if the small miner fails to diligently complete reclamation, the
7 department shall notify the small miner by certified mail that it intends to reclaim the operation unless the small
8 miner commences reclamation within 30 days and diligently completes the reclamation. The notice must be
9 mailed to the address stated on the small miner exclusion statement or, if the small miner has notified the
10 department of a different address by letter or in the annual certification form, to the most recent address given
11 to the department. If the small miner fails to commence reclamation within 30 days or to diligently complete
12 reclamation, the department may revoke the small miner exclusion statement, forfeit any bond that has been
13 posted with the department, and enter and reclaim the operation. If the small miner has not posted a bond with
14 the department or if the reasonable costs of reclamation exceed the amount of the bond, the department may
15 also collect additional reclamation costs, as set forth in subsection (6), before or after it incurs those costs.
16 (6) To collect additional reclamation costs, the department shall notify the small miner by certified
17 mail, at the address determined under subsection (5), of the additional reasonable reclamation costs and
18 request payment within 30 days. If the small miner does not pay the additional reclamation costs within 30
19 days, the department may bring an action in district court for payment of the estimated future costs and, if the
20 department has performed any reclamation, of its reasonable actual costs. The court shall order payment of

23 considers reasonable or the refund of any portion of any payment for estimated costs that exceeds the actual
24 reasonable costs incurred by the department.

17 performed by state personnel and for state materials and equipment used. If the small miner posts a surety
18 bond, the surety is liable to the state to the extent of the bond amount and the small miner is liable for the
19 remainder of the reasonable costs to the state of reclaiming the operation.
20 (d) If a small miner under this subsection (8) fails to commence reclamation of the operation within
21 6 months after cessation of mining or within an extended period allowed by the department for good cause
22 shown or if the small miner fails to diligently complete reclamation, the department shall notify the small miner
23 by certified mail that it intends to reclaim the operation unless the small miner commences reclamation within
24 30 days and diligently completes the reclamation. The notice must be mailed to the address stated on the small
25 miner exclusion statement or, if the small miner has notified the department of a different address by letter or in
26 the annual certification form, to the most recent address given to the department. If the small miner fails to
27 commence reclamation within 30 days or to diligently complete reclamation, the department may revoke the
28 small miner exclusion statement, forfeit any bond that has been posted with the department, and enter and

4 (e) To collect additional reclamation costs, the department shall notify the small miner by certified
5 mail, at the address determined under subsection (8)(d), of the additional reasonable reclamation costs and
6 request payment within 30 days. If the small miner does not pay the additional reclamation costs within 30
7 days, the department may bring an action in district court for payment of the estimated future costs and, if the
8 department has performed any reclamation, of its reasonable actual costs. The court shall order payment of
9 costs that it determines to be reasonable and shall retain jurisdiction until reclamation of the operation is
10 completed. Upon completion of reclamation, the court shall order payment of any additional costs that it
11 considers reasonable or the refund of any portion of any payment for estimated costs that exceeds the actual
12 reasonable costs incurred by the department.
