condition without receiving citizen complaints as required in subsection (3)(a).

affecting only portions of the county.

69th Legislature 2025 HB 742
(5)(6) For the purposes of enforcing an ordinance adopted under subsection (1), the county

property owner to comply with the ordinance, officers and employees of the county may enter upon the property
for the specific purpose of abating the violation of the ordinance and may assess the property owner for the

(2) A condition that affects an entire committee or neighborhood or any considerable number of
persons as provided in subsection (1)(a)(iii) is no less a nuisance because the extent of the annoyance or
damage inflicted on individuals is unequal.
(2)(3) The city or town council may not prohibit the placing of a "notice of violation" card on a motor
vehicle illegally parked in an accessible parking space."
