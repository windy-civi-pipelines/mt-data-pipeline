6 usable marijuana a day.
7 (b) (i) A registered cardholder may petition the department for an exception to the monthly limit on
8 purchases. The request must be accompanied by a confirmation from the physician who signed the registered
9 cardholder's written certification that the registered cardholder's debilitating medical condition warrants
10 purchase of an amount exceeding the monthly limit.
11 (ii) If the department approves an exception to the limit, the approval must establish the monthly
12 amount of usable marijuana that the registered cardholder may purchase and the limit must be entered into the
13 seed-to-sale tracking system.
14 (2) Except as provided in 16-12-108 and subject to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section,
15 an individual who possesses a registry identification card issued pursuant to this part may not be arrested,
16 prosecuted, or penalized in any manner or be denied any right or privilege, including but not limited to civil
17 penalty or disciplinary action by a professional licensing board or the department of labor and industry, solely

6 (b) This subsection (5) does not prevent the arrest or prosecution of an individual who is in the
7 vicinity of a registered cardholder's use of marijuana if the individual is in possession of or is using marijuana in

10 cause to search the person or individual or the property of the person or individual or otherwise subject the

13 (7) The provisions of this section relating to protection from arrest or prosecution do not apply to an
14 individual unless the individual has obtained a registry identification card prior to an arrest or the filing of a

16 after an arrest or the filing of a criminal charge.
17 (8) (a) A registered cardholder is presumed to be engaged in the use of marijuana as allowed by
18 this part if the person:
19 (i) is in possession of a valid registry identification card; and
20 (ii) is in possession of an amount of marijuana that does not exceed the amount permitted under
21 this part.
22 (b) The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the possession of marijuana was not for the
23 purpose of alleviating the symptoms or effects of a registered cardholder's debilitating medical condition and
24 exceeded the allowable amount of marijuana otherwise provided for in this part."
