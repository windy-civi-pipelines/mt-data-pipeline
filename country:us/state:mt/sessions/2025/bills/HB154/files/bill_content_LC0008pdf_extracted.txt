69th Legislature 2025 LC0008.1
1 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
2 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
3 electronic form:
4 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
5 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
6 market model area; and

8 documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.

20 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.

22 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
23 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
24 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
25 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
26 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
27 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
28 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.

6 for making the adjustment.
7 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and

9 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
10 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular

12 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the

16 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's

19 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
20 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board

22 accordance with the board's order."

25 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
26 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
27 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
28 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.

16 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
17 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
18 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
19 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
20 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
21 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
22 accordance with the board's order."
