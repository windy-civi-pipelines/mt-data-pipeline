22 collected on the property is distributed. At the time the exemption is granted, the department shall file a notice

24 exemption pursuant to this section has been granted. The notice must describe the penalty for default under

26 law. The notice must be on a form prescribed by the department.

25 does not apply.

1 minimum equalization of value requirement in subsection (4), and the remainder of the land value is exempt
2 from taxation.
3 (4) If the calculation in subsection (3) creates a land value that is less than the statewide average
4 value of land, then the value of the land may not be reduced in an amount that is less than the statewide
5 average value of land multiplied by the acreage of land for the subject property.
6 (5) This section does not provide an exemption for the primary residence and improvements
7 situated on the land.
8 (6) Property eligible for the exemption provided for in this section is not eligible for the property tax
9 assistance programs provided for in Title 15, chapter 6, part 3.

11 from the date on the classification and appraisal notice, as provided for in 15-7-102, for the exemption to be
12 considered for both years of the 2-year valuation cycle provided for in 15-7-111. An application made more than
13 30 days from the date of the classification and appraisal notice will be applicable only for the second year of the
14 2-year valuation cycle. After an exemption is approved, the applicant remains eligible for the exemption for the
15 remainder of the 2-year valuation cycle as long as the property is continually used as a primary residence by
16 the applicant. An applicant who does not apply for assistance during the first year of the valuation cycle may
17 apply no later than March 1 of the second year of the cycle.
18 (b) The application form must contain:
19 (i) an affirmation that the applicant owns and maintains the land and improvements as the primary

2 adjustment to the value include but are not limited to extraordinary, unusual, or infrequent events that are

4 expected to recur frequently, and that are not normally considered in the evaluation of the operating results of a

14 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
15 electronic form:
16 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;

6 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
7 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
8 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
9 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
10 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
11 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
12 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
13 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
14 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:

26 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
27 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,

3 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
