Dear Governor Gianforte:
As Director of the Department of Administration, I am responsible for overseeing the State
of Montana Benefit Plan (State Plan), which insures nearly 30,000 employees, legislators,
retirees, and their dependents. The State Plan is funded by both taxpayer dollars, also known
as the State Share, and employee/retiree contributions. Under your administration, through
good stewardship and strong financial management of the funds entrusted to us, we have
been able to achieve significant cost savings with the State Plan. During this session,
however, the 69th Legislature approved several bills that will increase costs, reduce
reserves, and threaten the progress we have made.
One of those bills, House Bill 607 (HB 607), requires insurance companies and the State Plan
to cover the cost of hearing aids for all plan members versus the current statutory
requirement of providing them to plan members under the age of 18. If HB 607 is enacted,
the State Plan will incur an additional $500,000-$600,000 in annual costs to provide the
required benefit to plan members.
Typically, the State Share and employee contributions to the State Plan are a major focus of
collective bargaining with state employees and the unions who represent them. Prior to
session, the state and unions negotiated and agreed to the State Share amount and
indirectly, the employee contributions that were ultimately included in House Bill 13 (HB 13).
With your encouragement, HB 13 received broad, bipartisan support from the Legislature,
and you signed it into law earlier this year.
During negotiations with employees, there was no indication that hearing aid coverage was
a needed benefit, and no funding was included in the state’s budget or HB 13 to pay for
providing that additional benefit. Although the additional cost of the expanded hearing aid
mandate was noted in the fiscal note for HB 607, no appropriation was included to offset the
expense.

As a result, the costs associated with HB 607 will be paid from and deplete the State Plan’s
reserve funds. This adds to the likelihood that the state will need to increase the amount of
tax dollars used to support the State Plan (the State Share), negotiate with employees to
increase their contributions to the State Plan, or agree to a reduction in other benefits offered
under the State Plan.
Alternatively, if you chose to exercise your power to veto HB 607, this issue could be subject
to negotiations with state employees prior to the next session, included in that session’s pay
plan bill, or brought forward in a standalone bill that includes the funding necessary to
expand hearing aid coverage. In the spirit of financial responsibility that has guided our
efforts to keep a lid on health plan increases, we respectfully request that you carefully
consider whether HB 607 is aligned with your goal to carefully and conservatively manage
state finances.
Sincerely,
Misty Ann Giles
Director
