26 purchase price, uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the retailer until the full
27 purchase price is paid, expenses incurred in attempting to collect any debt, debts sold or assigned to unrelated

2 Section 119. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
3 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
4 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
5 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
6 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
7 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
8 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
9 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
10 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
11 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
12 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
13 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
14 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
15 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
16 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
17 labor.
18 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
19 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
20 including newly taxable property.
21 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
22 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
23 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
24 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
25 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
26 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
27 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
28 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
- 70 - LC 3297
69th Legislature LC 3297
1 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
2 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
3 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
4 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
5 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
6 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
7 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
8 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
9 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
10 following tax year.
11 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
12 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
13 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
14 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
15 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
16 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
17 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:
18 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or

20 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
21 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
22 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
23 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
24 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
25 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
26 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the
27 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
28 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
- 71 - LC 3297
69th Legislature LC 3297
1 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
2 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.

4 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

12 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
13 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
14 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
15 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
16 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
17 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) may not be included in the amount of property taxes
18 actually assessed in a subsequent year.
19 (10) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
20 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
21 authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated
22 operating funds by a county or municipality during that time.
23 (11) The department may adopt rules to implement this section. The rules may include a method for
24 calculating the percentage of change in valuation for purposes of determining the elimination of property, new
25 improvements, or newly taxable value in a governmental unit."

21 trustee resolution. (1) An existing elementary district that is not part of a unified school system or governed by
22 a joint board with a high school district may expand into a K-12 district under the procedures outlined in this
23 section only if the elementary district's ANB, as calculated under the provisions of 20-9-311, is at least 1,000.
24 (2) The expansion to a K-12 district may be requested by the trustees of an existing elementary
25 district through passage of a resolution that includes the information outlined in 20-6-105(3) and requests the
26 county superintendent to order an election to allow the electors of the elementary district to consider the
27 proposition of expanding the elementary school district into a K-12 district. The trustees of an existing
28 elementary district with an ANB of at least 1,000 may not pass a resolution for expansion more than one time
- 90 - LC 3297
69th Legislature LC 3297
1 within a 5-year period.
2 (3) (a) If the proposition for the expansion is approved by the electors of the elementary district and
3 the trustees issue a certificate of election as provided in 20-20-416, for a period of 2 years from the date of the
4 certification of the election the elementary trustees have the authority to propose to the electors of the
5 elementary district:

9 to accommodate high school students.
10 (b) The bond limitations pursuant to 20-9-406 imposed on a district proposing a bond under
11 subsection (3)(a) must be calculated on the limits for a K-12 district with the high school ANB calculated by

13 (c) A bond approved under subsection (3)(a) becomes a bond of, and may not be issued until the
14 creation of, the K-12 district formed pursuant to subsection (4).
15 (d) A district that issues a bond under this subsection (3) is eligible for facility reimbursements and
16 advances pursuant to 20-9-366 through 20-9-371 that, until the new high school has enrolled students in all

18 ANB calculated by dividing the ANB of the elementary district by 9 and multiplying the result by 4.
19 (e) (d) Until the county superintendent orders the creation of a new high school district and attachment
20 of the expanding elementary district to form a new K-12 district pursuant to subsection (4), the existing high
21 school district remains intact for all purposes.
22 (4) If elementary electors approve a bond pursuant to subsection (3), on July 1 following the
23 approval of the bond the county superintendent shall order the creation of a new high school district with
24 identical boundaries to the expanding elementary district and the immediate attachment of the expanding
25 elementary district to form a K-12 district. The county superintendent shall send a copy of the order to the board
26 of county commissioners and to the trustees of the districts affected by the creation of the district. The trustees
27 of the expanding elementary district must be designated as the trustees of the new K-12 district.

2 school budgeting provisions of this title, except that:
3 (a) the ANB for any inaugural grades for the high school program of the K-12 district must be
4 estimated by the trustees and may not exceed the number resulting from dividing the highest budgeted ANB of
5 the elementary program in the preceding 3 fiscal years by 9 and multiplying the result by the number of grades
6 in which the high school will enroll students for the first time in the ensuing school year;
7 (b) the number of quality educators for the high school program must be estimated by the trustees
8 and may not exceed the number resulting from dividing the ANB estimated under subsection (5)(a) by 10;

13 the quality educator payment, and the budget components derived from ANB counts; and
14 (e) the district's BASE aid for the upcoming year must be based on the general fund budget
15 adopted by the trustees for the upcoming school year.

6 district. However, if bonds of the high school district were approved at a bond election conducted before the
7 creation of the K-12 district, all bonds of the high school district issued by the high school district under the
8 bond election authority must remain secured by and be the indebtedness of the territory of the high school
9 district as of the date the bond authority was approved by voters and must be paid by tax levies against that
10 territory.

20 affected by a later reorganization of the high school district or the K-12 district is governed by the provisions of
21 Title 20, chapter 6, part 4.
22 (8) When a K-8 district expands to a K-12 district as provided for in this section, a principal,
23 teacher, or other certified employee of the original high school district who has a right of tenure under Montana

3 distribution of oil and natural gas production taxes as required under 15-36-332(6) until the amount distributed
4 reaches the limitation in subsection (1) of this section. The department of revenue shall deposit any amount
5 exceeding the limitation in subsection (1) in the guarantee account provided for in 20-9-622.

5 natural gas revenue bonds for the next 12-month period.
6 (5) (a) The limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school district may retain under
7 subsection (1) must be increased for any school district that was eligible for a significant enrollment increase
8 payment pursuant to 20-9-166. The increase in the limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school
9 district may retain under subsection (1) applies in the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which
10 the district was eligible and must be calculated by multiplying $45,000 times each additional ANB used to
11 calculate the significant enrollment increase payment pursuant to 20-9-166, including the absorption factor
12 reduction.
13 (b) For a district in nonoperating status under 20-9-505, the maximum amount of oil and natural
14 gas production taxes that a school district may retain is 130% of the school district's maximum budget in the
15 district's most recent operating year, determined in accordance with 20-9-308.
16 (6) In any year in which the actual oil and natural gas production taxes received by a school district
17 are less than 50% of the total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior year, the
18 district may transfer money from any budgeted fund to its general fund in an amount not to exceed the amount

4 tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number determined by the
5 superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed to eligible school
6 districts equal to 85% of the decrease in the calculated amount between the 2 years; and
7 (ii) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school mill value
8 per ANB for school retirement guaranteed tax base purposes under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number

21 Section 143. Section 20-9-406, MCA, is amended to read:
22 "20-9-406. Limitations on amount of bond issue -- definition of federal impact aid basic support
23 payment -- oil and natural gas payment. (1) (a) Except as provided in subsection (1)(c), the maximum
24 amount for which an elementary district or a high school district may become indebted by the issuance of
25 general obligation bonds, including all indebtedness represented by outstanding general obligation bonds of
26 previous issues, registered warrants, outstanding obligations under 20-9-471, oil and natural gas revenue
27 bonds to which a deficiency tax levy is pledged, and any other loans or notes payable that are held as general
28 obligations of the district, is 100% of the taxable value of the property subject to taxation, as ascertained by the
- 113 - LC 3297
69th Legislature LC 3297
1 last assessment for state, county, and school taxes previous to the incurring of the indebtedness.
2 (b) Except as provided in subsection (1)(c), the maximum amount for which a K-12 school district,
3 as formed pursuant to 20-6-701, may become indebted by the issuance of general obligation bonds, including
4 all indebtedness represented by outstanding general obligation bonds of previous issues, registered warrants,

9 taxation and 100% of the taxable value of the property in its high school program subject to taxation, as
10 ascertained by the last assessment for state, county, and school taxes previous to the incurring of the
11 indebtedness.
12 (c) (i) Unless the maximum amount calculated under subsection (1)(a) yields a greater amount,

17 warrants, outstanding obligations under 20-9-471, oil and natural gas revenue bonds to which a deficiency tax
18 levy is pledged, and any other loans or notes payable that are held as general obligations of the district, is the

20 district, unless the maximum amount calculated under subsection (1)(b) yields a greater amount, the maximum
21 amount for which the district may become indebted is the sum of the facility guaranteed mill value per
22 elementary ANB times 1,000 times the elementary ANB of the district and the facility guaranteed mill value per
23 high school ANB times 1,000 times the high school ANB of the district. For the purpose of calculating ANB

25 under 20-9-311.
26 (ii) If mutually agreed upon by the affected districts, for the purpose of calculating its maximum
27 bonded indebtedness under this subsection (1)(c), a district may include the ANB of the district plus the number
28 of students residing within the district for which the district or county pays tuition for attendance at a school in
- 114 - LC 3297
69th Legislature LC 3297
1 an adjacent district. The receiving district may not use out-of-district ANB for the purpose of calculating its
2 maximum indebtedness if the out-of-district ANB has been included in the ANB of the sending district pursuant
3 to the mutual agreement. For the purpose of calculating ANB under this subsection, a district may use the
4 greater of the current year ANB or the 3-year ANB calculated under 20-9-311.
5 (2) The maximum amounts determined in subsection (1) do not pertain to indebtedness imposed
6 by special improvement district obligations or assessments against the school district or to general obligation
7 bonds issued for the repayment of tax protests lost by the district. All general obligation bonds issued in excess
8 of the amount are void, except as provided in this section.
9 (3) The maximum amount of impact aid revenue bonds that an elementary district, high school
10 district, or K-12 school district may issue may not exceed a total aggregate amount equal to three times the
11 average of the school district's annual federal impact aid basic support payments for the 5 years immediately
12 preceding the issuance of the bonds. However, at the time of issuance of the bonds, the average annual
13 payment of principal of and interest on the impact aid bonds each year may not exceed 35% of the total federal

15 (4) The maximum amount of oil and natural gas revenue bonds that an elementary district, high
16 school district, or K-12 school district may issue may not exceed a total aggregate amount equal to three times

20 revenue bonds each year may not exceed 35% of the total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the
21 school district under the limitations in 20-9-310 for the immediately preceding fiscal year. If the oil and natural
22 gas revenue bonds are also secured by a deficiency tax levy as provided in 20-9-437, the debt limitation
23 provided in subsection (1) of this section applies to the bonds.
24 (5) When the total indebtedness of a school district has reached the limitations prescribed in this
25 section, the school district may pay all reasonable and necessary expenses of the school district on a cash
26 basis in accordance with the financial administration provisions of this chapter.
27 (6) Whenever bonds are issued for the purpose of refunding bonds, any money to the credit of the
28 debt service fund for the payment of the bonds to be refunded is applied toward the payment of the bonds and
- 115 - LC 3297
69th Legislature LC 3297
1 the refunding bond issue is decreased accordingly.
2 (7) As used in this part, "federal impact aid basic support payment" means the annual impact aid
3 revenue received by a district under 20 U.S.C. 7703(b) but excludes revenue received for impact aid special
4 education under 20 U.S.C. 7703(d) and impact aid construction under 20 U.S.C. 7707."

8 (1) "Amortization bond" means that form of bond on which a part of the principal is required to be
9 paid each time that interest becomes due and payable. The part payment of principal increases with each
10 following installment in the same amount that the interest payment decreases, so that the combined amount
11 payable on principal and interest is the same on each payment date. However, the payment on the initial
12 interest payment date may be less or greater than the amount of other payments on the bond, reflecting the
13 payment of interest only or the payment of interest for a period different from that between other interest
14 payment dates. The final payment may vary from prior payments in amount as a result of rounding prior
15 payments.
16 (2) "General obligation bonds" means bonds that pledge the full faith and credit and the taxing
17 power of a school district.
18 (3) "Impact aid revenue bonds" means bonds that pledge and are payable solely from federal
19 impact aid basic support payments received and deposited to the credit of the fund established in 20-9-514.
20 (4) "Oil and natural gas revenue bonds" means bonds that pledge and are payable from a first lien
21 on oil and natural gas production taxes received by a school district pursuant to 20-9-310. Oil and natural gas
22 revenue bonds to which a tax deficiency is pledged are not considered general obligation bonds that are eligible
23 to receive guaranteed tax base aid pursuant to 20-9-367 but are to be considered in determining the debt limit
24 of a school district for the purposes of 20-9-406.
25 (5) "Serial bonds" means a bond issue payable in annual installments of principal commencing not
26 more than 2 years from the date of issue, any one installment consisting of one or more bonds, with the
27 principal amount of bonds maturing or subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption in each installment,
28 commencing with the installment payable in the fourth year after the date of issue, not exceeding three times
- 116 - LC 3297

12 and the district's mill value; and
13 (iv) divide the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) by the difference resulting from
14 subtracting the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) from the district's school major maintenance
15 amount.
16 (b) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year greater than or equal to
17 97% of the district's general fund maximum budget in the prior year, the amount determined in subsection
18 (3)(a)(iv) rounded to the nearest cent is the amount of school major maintenance aid per dollar of local effort,
19 not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the district's school
20 major maintenance amount.
21 (c) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year less than 97% of the
22 district's maximum budget in the prior year, multiply the amount determined in subsection (3)(a)(iv) by the ratio
23 of the district's adopted general fund budget in the prior year to the district's maximum general fund budget in
24 the prior year. The result, rounded to the nearest cent, is the amount of state school major maintenance aid per
25 dollar of local effort, not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the
26 district's school major maintenance amount.
27 (4) Using the taxable valuation most recently determined by the department of revenue under 20-
28 9-369, the superintendent shall provide school districts with a preliminary estimated amount of state school
- 124 - LC 3297
69th Legislature LC 3297
1 major maintenance aid per dollar of local effort for the ensuing school year no later than March 1 and a final
2 amount for the current school year no later than July 31.
3 (5) If the appropriation from or the available funds in the school major maintenance aid account in
4 any school fiscal year are less than the amount for which school districts would otherwise qualify, the
5 superintendent of public instruction shall proportionally prorate the aid distributed to ensure that the distributions
6 do not exceed the appropriated or available funds.
7 (6) If in any fiscal year the amount of revenue in the school major maintenance aid account is
8 sufficient to fund school major maintenance aid without a proration reduction pursuant to subsection (5) and if in
9 that same fiscal year the amount of revenue available in the school facility and technology account established
10 in 20-9-516 will result in a proration reduction in debt service assistance pursuant to 20-9-346 (2)(b) for that
11 fiscal year, the state treasurer shall transfer any excess funds in the school major maintenance aid account to
12 the school facility and technology account, not to exceed the amount required to avoid a proration reduction.
13 (7) (6) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
14 (a) "Local effort" means an amount of money raised by levying no more than 10 mills pursuant to
15 20-9-502(3) and, provided that 10 mills have been levied, any additional amount of money deposited or
16 transferred by trustees to the subfund pursuant to 20-9-502(3).
17 (b) "School major maintenance amount" means the sum of $15,000 and the product of $110
18 multiplied by the district's budgeted ANB for the prior fiscal year."

10 not required to file a federal income tax return may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which
11 the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the retailer's books and records and would be eligible for a bad
12 debt deduction for federal income tax purposes if the retailer was required to file a federal income tax return. If

14 the amount collected must be paid and reported on the next return due after the collection. A retailer may
15 allocate its bad debts among states if the books and records of the retailer claiming the bad debt can support
16 the allocation.

20 Code or any disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes that is owned by the retailer or a related party
21 has written off as uncollectible for federal income tax purposes.
22 (b) In computing the amount of tax due, a seller may deduct bad debts from the total amount on
23 which the tax is calculated for any return. Any deduction taken or refund paid that is attributed to bad debts may
24 not include interest. Bad debts include worthless checks, worthless credit card payments, and uncollectible
25 credit accounts. Bad debts do not include financing charges or interest, sales or use taxes charged on the
26 purchase price, uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the retailer until the full
27 purchase price is paid, expenses incurred in attempting to collect any debt, debts sold or assigned to unrelated
28 third parties for collection, and repossessed property. A bad debt deduction may not be claimed by any person
- 36 - LC 3297

69th Legislature LC 3297
1 that has purchased accounts receivable for collection unless the person is a successor that has acquired the
2 entire business of the retailer that incurred the bad debt, the person is a related party, or the person is a
3 disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes that is owned by the seller or a related party.
4 (3) If a retailer's amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales for the period during
5 which the bad debt is written off, the seller may obtain a credit or refund of tax on any amount of bad debt. A
6 credit or refund under this paragraph may not include interest.

21 (2) If the department has granted a retailer the authority to report and pay sales tax on the cash
22 basis and a retailer requests in writing the authority to report and pay sales tax on the accrual basis, the
23 department may grant the authority if assessment and collection of taxes are not jeopardized.

7 partner's liability for a prior failure of the corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability
8 partnership, or limited liability limited partnership to file a return or remit the tax due. The sum due for a liability
9 may be assessed and collected as provided by law.

3 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
4 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
5 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
6 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
7 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
8 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
9 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
10 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
11 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
12 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
13 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
14 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
15 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,

17 labor.
18 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any

6 (5) (a) The limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school district may retain under
7 subsection (1) must be increased for any school district that was eligible for a significant enrollment increase

3 "20-9-336. School equalization and property tax reduction account -- uses. (1) There is a school
4 equalization and property tax reduction account in the state special revenue fund. Contingent on appropriation
5 by the legislature, money in the account is for distribution to school districts as the second source of funding for
6 state equalization aid as provided in 20-9-343. At fiscal yearend, any fund balance in the account exceeding
7 what was appropriated must be transferred to the guarantee account established in 20-9-622 after the property
8 tax reductions under subsection (2) of this section.
9 (2) The account receives revenue as described in 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360 [sections 44
10 and 89]. Prior to levying school district property taxes or countywide school property taxes authorized under this
11 Title 20, the county commissioners shall request funding from the school equalization and property tax
12 reduction account to eliminate or reduce the need for property tax levies. The state treasurer shall approve
13 these requests and distribute money to the counties for the following levies in priority order:
14 (a) school district BASE levies;
15 (b) countywide school retirement levies;
16 (c) countywide levies for school transportation;

23 (j) school district levies in support of the technology acquisition and depreciation fund.
24 (3) Beginning in fiscal year 2025, each December the superintendent of public instruction shall
25 forecast the amount of revenue the account will receive in that fiscal year by dividing the sum of the taxable
26 value of all property in the state reported by the department of revenue pursuant to 20-9-369 by 1,000 to
27 determine a statewide value mill and then multiplying that amount by 95 mills, or the number of mills calculated
28 by the department of revenue under 15-10-420 (8) for the applicable fiscal year. If the forecasted amount differs
- 107 - LC 3297

69th Legislature LC 3297
1 from the amount determined through the same calculation in the prior fiscal year by $2 million or more and is:
2 (a) less, then the superintendent shall:
3 (i) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school guaranteed
4 tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number determined by the
5 superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed to eligible school
6 districts equal to 85% of the decrease in the calculated amount between the 2 years; and
7 (ii) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school mill value
8 per ANB for school retirement guaranteed tax base purposes under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number
9 determined by the superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of retirement guaranteed tax base aid
10 distributed to eligible school districts equal to 15% of the decrease in the calculated amount between the 2
11 years;
12 (b) more, then the superintendent shall increase the multipliers used in the guaranteed tax base
13 formulas under 20-9-366 and in the formula for school major maintenance aid under 20-9-525 to the nearest
14 whole number by an amount calculated by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of
15 guaranteed tax base aid and school major maintenance aid distributed to eligible counties and school districts
16 equal to 55% of the increase in the calculated amount between the 2 years in the following order, with any
17 amount exceeding the caps under subsections (3)(b)(i) through (3)(b)(iii) flowing to the next mechanism:
18 (i) first, the multiplier used in calculating the statewide mill value per elementary and high school
19 ANB for retirement purposes, not to exceed 305%;
20 (ii) second, the multiplier used in calculating the amount of state school major maintenance aid
21 support for each dollar of local effort, not to exceed 365%; and
22 (iii) third, the multiplier used in calculating the facility guaranteed mill value per ANB for school
23 facility entitlement guaranteed tax base purposes, not to exceed 300%.
24 (4) (a) The adjustments to the multipliers under subsection (3) are applicable to state equalization
25 aid distributions in the fiscal year following the adjustment.

11 payable on principal and interest is the same on each payment date. However, the payment on the initial
12 interest payment date may be less or greater than the amount of other payments on the bond, reflecting the
13 payment of interest only or the payment of interest for a period different from that between other interest
14 payment dates. The final payment may vary from prior payments in amount as a result of rounding prior
15 payments.
16 (2) "General obligation bonds" means bonds that pledge the full faith and credit and the taxing
17 power of a school district.

20 (4) "Oil and natural gas revenue bonds" means bonds that pledge and are payable from a first lien
21 on oil and natural gas production taxes received by a school district pursuant to 20-9-310. Oil and natural gas
22 revenue bonds to which a tax deficiency is pledged are not considered general obligation bonds that are eligible
23 to receive guaranteed tax base aid pursuant to 20-9-367 but are to be considered in determining the debt limit
24 of a school district for the purposes of 20-9-406.
25 (5) "Serial bonds" means a bond issue payable in annual installments of principal commencing not
26 more than 2 years from the date of issue, any one installment consisting of one or more bonds, with the

25 pursuant to 20-9-502(3) in the current school fiscal year, with the amount of state support per dollar of local
26 effort of the applicable elementary and high school program of each district determined as follows:
27 (i) using the taxable valuation most recently determined by the department of revenue under 20-9-
28 369:
- 123 - LC 3297

69th Legislature LC 3297
1 (A) divide the total statewide taxable valuation by the statewide total of school major maintenance
2 amounts and, subject to adjustment under 20-9-336, multiply the result by 187%;
3 (B) multiply the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(i)(A) by the district's school major
4 maintenance amount;
5 (C) subtract the district's taxable valuation from the amount determined under subsection
6 (3)(a)(i)(B); and
7 (D) divide the amount determined under subsection (3)(a)(i)(C) by 1,000;
8 (ii) determine the greater of the amount determined in subsection (3)(a)(i) or 18% of the district's
9 mill value;
10 (iii) multiply the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(ii) by the district's school major
11 maintenance amount, then divide the product by the sum of the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(ii)
12 and the district's mill value; and
13 (iv) divide the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) by the difference resulting from
14 subtracting the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) from the district's school major maintenance
15 amount.
16 (b) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year greater than or equal to
17 97% of the district's general fund maximum budget in the prior year, the amount determined in subsection
18 (3)(a)(iv) rounded to the nearest cent is the amount of school major maintenance aid per dollar of local effort,
19 not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the district's school
20 major maintenance amount.
21 (c) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year less than 97% of the
22 district's maximum budget in the prior year, multiply the amount determined in subsection (3)(a)(iv) by the ratio
23 of the district's adopted general fund budget in the prior year to the district's maximum general fund budget in
24 the prior year. The result, rounded to the nearest cent, is the amount of state school major maintenance aid per
25 dollar of local effort, not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the
26 district's school major maintenance amount.
27 (4) Using the taxable valuation most recently determined by the department of revenue under 20-
28 9-369, the superintendent shall provide school districts with a preliminary estimated amount of state school

2 amount for the current school year no later than July 31.
3 (5) If the appropriation from or the available funds in the school major maintenance aid account in
4 any school fiscal year are less than the amount for which school districts would otherwise qualify, the
5 superintendent of public instruction shall proportionally prorate the aid distributed to ensure that the distributions
6 do not exceed the appropriated or available funds.
7 (6) If in any fiscal year the amount of revenue in the school major maintenance aid account is
8 sufficient to fund school major maintenance aid without a proration reduction pursuant to subsection (5) and if in
9 that same fiscal year the amount of revenue available in the school facility and technology account established
10 in 20-9-516 will result in a proration reduction in debt service assistance pursuant to 20-9-346 (2)(b) for that
11 fiscal year, the state treasurer shall transfer any excess funds in the school major maintenance aid account to
12 the school facility and technology account, not to exceed the amount required to avoid a proration reduction.
13 (7) (6) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
14 (a) "Local effort" means an amount of money raised by levying no more than 10 mills pursuant to
