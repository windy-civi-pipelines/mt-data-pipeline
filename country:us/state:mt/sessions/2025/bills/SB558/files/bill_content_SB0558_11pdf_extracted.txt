14 requirements. (1) For any internet purchase made pursuant to [sections 108 through 116], notice on the
15 checkout page fulfills both the website and invoice notice requirements simultaneously. The notice is sufficient if
16 the noncollecting retailer provides a prominent linking notice that reads as follows: "See important Montana
17 sales and use tax information regarding the tax you may owe directly to the State of Montana." The checkout
18 page notice link must direct the purchaser to the principal notice required by [section 109].
19 (2) If a retailer is required to provide a similar notice for another state in addition to Montana, the

26 the transaction includes a line designated "sales tax" and shows the amount of sales tax as zero, this
27 constitutes a display implying that no tax is due on the purchase. This display must be accompanied by the
28 notice required by [section 109] each time it appears.

1 Section 119. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
2 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
3 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
4 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
5 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
6 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
7 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
8 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
9 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
10 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
11 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
12 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
13 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
14 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
15 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
16 labor.
17 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
18 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
19 including newly taxable property.
20 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
21 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
22 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
23 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
24 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
25 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
26 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
27 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
28 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
- 70 - Authorized Print Version – SB 558
69th Legislature SB 558.1
1 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
2 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
3 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
4 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
5 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
6 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
7 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
8 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
9 following tax year.
10 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
11 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
12 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
13 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
14 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
15 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).

19 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
20 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
21 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
22 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
23 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
24 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
25 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the
26 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
27 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
28 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
- 71 - Authorized Print Version – SB 558
69th Legislature SB 558.1
1 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
2 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
3 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

11 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
12 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
13 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
14 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
15 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
16 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) may not be included in the amount of property taxes
17 actually assessed in a subsequent year.
18 (10) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
19 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
20 authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated
21 operating funds by a county or municipality during that time.
22 (11) The department may adopt rules to implement this section. The rules may include a method for
23 calculating the percentage of change in valuation for purposes of determining the elimination of property, new
24 improvements, or newly taxable value in a governmental unit."

12 may not grant approval for the project until all of the applicant's taxes have been paid in full. Taxes paid under
13 protest do not preclude approval. If a taxpayer receives approval of a tax abatement prior to commencement of
14 construction, the abatement does not extend to property that is outside the scope of the project plan that was
15 submitted to the governing body with the application.
16 (b) The governing body shall:

2 (iii) In addition to use of a tuition levy to pay tuition for out-of-district attendance of a resident pupil,
3 a school district may also include in its tuition levy an amount necessary to pay for the full costs of providing a
4 free appropriate public education, as defined in 20-7-401, in the district to any child with a disability who lives in
5 the district. The amount of the levy imposed for the costs associated with educating each child with a disability
6 under this subsection (4)(a)(iii) is limited to the actual cost of service under the child's individualized education

14 (b) When a child has approval to attend a school outside the child's district of residence because
15 of a parent's or guardian's request under the provisions of 20-5-320 or 20-5-321(1)(c), the parent or guardian of
16 the child is responsible for transportation unless otherwise agreed to in the out-of-district attendance
17 agreement.
18 (5) (a) Except as provided in subsection (5)(b), the district of attendance shall anticipate and credit
19 tuition receipts to the district general fund, to reduce the general fund net levy requirement first to the BASE
20 budget and any remaining to the over-BASE budget pursuant to 20-9-141, and transportation receipts to the
21 transportation fund. In order to provide local property tax reduction for the tuition amount received under 20-5-
22 323(1), the amount of the reduction in the BASE budget mills levied as a result of anticipated tuition payments
23 must be calculated as a final step in computing the district's general fund net BASE levy requirement pursuant
24 to the procedure set forth in 20-9-141(2) and the district's guaranteed tax base aid must be calculated prior to
25 the reduction in BASE mills.
26 (b) Any tuition receipts received for a pupil who is a child with a disability under 20-5-323(2) or for
27 a student without disabilities who requires a program with costs that exceed the average district costs under 20-
28 5-323(3) that exceed the tuition amount received for a pupil without disabilities must be deposited in the district

14 adopted by the trustees for the upcoming school year.
15 (6) Until the first school year in which the K-12 school district enrolls high school students in all

11 total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior school fiscal year to the district's
12 general fund BASE budget for the upcoming school fiscal year, then:

5 (5) (a) The limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school district may retain under
6 subsection (1) must be increased for any school district that was eligible for a significant enrollment increase

8 district may retain under subsection (1) applies in the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which
9 the district was eligible and must be calculated by multiplying $45,000 times each additional ANB used to
10 calculate the significant enrollment increase payment pursuant to 20-9-166, including the absorption factor
11 reduction.
12 (b) For a district in nonoperating status under 20-9-505, the maximum amount of oil and natural
13 gas production taxes that a school district may retain is 130% of the school district's maximum budget in the
14 district's most recent operating year, determined in accordance with 20-9-308.
15 (6) In any year in which the actual oil and natural gas production taxes received by a school district
16 are less than 50% of the total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior year, the
17 district may transfer money from any budgeted fund to its general fund in an amount not to exceed the amount

3 greater of the current year ANB or the 3-year ANB calculated under 20-9-311.
4 (2) The maximum amounts determined in subsection (1) do not pertain to indebtedness imposed
5 by special improvement district obligations or assessments against the school district or to general obligation

8 paid each time that interest becomes due and payable. The part payment of principal increases with each
9 following installment in the same amount that the interest payment decreases, so that the combined amount
10 payable on principal and interest is the same on each payment date. However, the payment on the initial
11 interest payment date may be less or greater than the amount of other payments on the bond, reflecting the
12 payment of interest only or the payment of interest for a period different from that between other interest
13 payment dates. The final payment may vary from prior payments in amount as a result of rounding prior
14 payments.
15 (2) "General obligation bonds" means bonds that pledge the full faith and credit and the taxing
16 power of a school district.
17 (3) "Impact aid revenue bonds" means bonds that pledge and are payable solely from federal
18 impact aid basic support payments received and deposited to the credit of the fund established in 20-9-514.
19 (4) "Oil and natural gas revenue bonds" means bonds that pledge and are payable from a first lien
20 on oil and natural gas production taxes received by a school district pursuant to 20-9-310. Oil and natural gas
21 revenue bonds to which a tax deficiency is pledged are not considered general obligation bonds that are eligible
22 to receive guaranteed tax base aid pursuant to 20-9-367 but are to be considered in determining the debt limit
23 of a school district for the purposes of 20-9-406.
24 (5) "Serial bonds" means a bond issue payable in annual installments of principal commencing not
25 more than 2 years from the date of issue, any one installment consisting of one or more bonds, with the
26 principal amount of bonds maturing or subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption in each installment,
27 commencing with the installment payable in the fourth year after the date of issue, not exceeding three times
28 the principal amount of the bonds payable in the immediately preceding installment."

13 (iii) energy-efficient window and door systems and insulation;
14 (iv) plumbing systems;
15 (v) electrical systems and lighting systems;
16 (vi) information technology infrastructure, including internet connectivity both within and to the
17 school facility; and
18 (vii) other critical repairs to an existing school facility or facilities.
19 (3) (a) In any year in which the legislature has appropriated funds for distribution from the school
20 major maintenance aid account, the superintendent of public instruction shall administer the distribution of
21 school major maintenance aid from the school major maintenance aid account for deposit in the subfund of the
22 building reserve fund provided for in 20-9-502(3)(e). Subject to proration under subsection (5) of this section,
23 aid must be annually distributed no later than the last working day of May to a school district imposing a levy
24 pursuant to 20-9-502(3) in the current school fiscal year, with the amount of state support per dollar of local
25 effort of the applicable elementary and high school program of each district determined as follows:
26 (i) using the taxable valuation most recently determined by the department of revenue under 20-9-
27 369:
28 (A) divide the total statewide taxable valuation by the statewide total of school major maintenance
- 123 - Authorized Print Version – SB 558
69th Legislature SB 558.1
1 amounts and, subject to adjustment under 20-9-336, multiply the result by 187%;
2 (B) multiply the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(i)(A) by the district's school major
3 maintenance amount;
4 (C) subtract the district's taxable valuation from the amount determined under subsection
5 (3)(a)(i)(B); and
6 (D) divide the amount determined under subsection (3)(a)(i)(C) by 1,000;
7 (ii) determine the greater of the amount determined in subsection (3)(a)(i) or 18% of the district's
8 mill value;
9 (iii) multiply the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(ii) by the district's school major
10 maintenance amount, then divide the product by the sum of the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(ii)
11 and the district's mill value; and
12 (iv) divide the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) by the difference resulting from
13 subtracting the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) from the district's school major maintenance
14 amount.
15 (b) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year greater than or equal to
16 97% of the district's general fund maximum budget in the prior year, the amount determined in subsection
17 (3)(a)(iv) rounded to the nearest cent is the amount of school major maintenance aid per dollar of local effort,
18 not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the district's school
19 major maintenance amount.
20 (c) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year less than 97% of the
21 district's maximum budget in the prior year, multiply the amount determined in subsection (3)(a)(iv) by the ratio
22 of the district's adopted general fund budget in the prior year to the district's maximum general fund budget in
23 the prior year. The result, rounded to the nearest cent, is the amount of state school major maintenance aid per
24 dollar of local effort, not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the
25 district's school major maintenance amount.
26 (4) Using the taxable valuation most recently determined by the department of revenue under 20-
27 9-369, the superintendent shall provide school districts with a preliminary estimated amount of state school
28 major maintenance aid per dollar of local effort for the ensuing school year no later than March 1 and a final
- 124 - Authorized Print Version – SB 558
69th Legislature SB 558.1
1 amount for the current school year no later than July 31.
2 (5) If the appropriation from or the available funds in the school major maintenance aid account in
3 any school fiscal year are less than the amount for which school districts would otherwise qualify, the
4 superintendent of public instruction shall proportionally prorate the aid distributed to ensure that the distributions
5 do not exceed the appropriated or available funds.
6 (6) If in any fiscal year the amount of revenue in the school major maintenance aid account is
7 sufficient to fund school major maintenance aid without a proration reduction pursuant to subsection (5) and if in
8 that same fiscal year the amount of revenue available in the school facility and technology account established
9 in 20-9-516 will result in a proration reduction in debt service assistance pursuant to 20-9-346 (2)(b) for that
10 fiscal year, the state treasurer shall transfer any excess funds in the school major maintenance aid account to
11 the school facility and technology account, not to exceed the amount required to avoid a proration reduction.
12 (7) (6) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
13 (a) "Local effort" means an amount of money raised by levying no more than 10 mills pursuant to
14 20-9-502(3) and, provided that 10 mills have been levied, any additional amount of money deposited or
15 transferred by trustees to the subfund pursuant to 20-9-502(3).
16 (b) "School major maintenance amount" means the sum of $15,000 and the product of $110
17 multiplied by the district's budgeted ANB for the prior fiscal year."

28 (2) The person who is to prepay under this section is not obligated to prepay the entire amount

10 not required to file a federal income tax return may deduct a bad debt on a return filed for the period in which
11 the bad debt is written off as uncollectible in the retailer's books and records and would be eligible for a bad

14 the amount collected must be paid and reported on the next return due after the collection. A retailer may
15 allocate its bad debts among states if the books and records of the retailer claiming the bad debt can support

19 retailer or any party related to the retailer within the meaning of section 267 or 707 of the Internal Revenue
20 Code or any disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes that is owned by the retailer or a related party
21 has written off as uncollectible for federal income tax purposes.
22 (b) In computing the amount of tax due, a seller may deduct bad debts from the total amount on
23 which the tax is calculated for any return. Any deduction taken or refund paid that is attributed to bad debts may
24 not include interest. Bad debts include worthless checks, worthless credit card payments, and uncollectible
25 credit accounts. Bad debts do not include financing charges or interest, sales or use taxes charged on the
26 purchase price, uncollectible amounts on property that remains in the possession of the retailer until the full
27 purchase price is paid, expenses incurred in attempting to collect any debt, debts sold or assigned to unrelated
28 third parties for collection, and repossessed property. A bad debt deduction may not be claimed by any person

69th Legislature SB 558.1
1 that has purchased accounts receivable for collection unless the person is a successor that has acquired the
2 entire business of the retailer that incurred the bad debt, the person is a related party, or the person is a
3 disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes that is owned by the seller or a related party.
4 (3) If a retailer's amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales for the period during
5 which the bad debt is written off, the seller may obtain a credit or refund of tax on any amount of bad debt. A
6 credit or refund under this paragraph may not include interest.
7 (4) If a retailer's filing responsibilities have been assumed by a certified service provider as defined
8 in [section 91], the service provider may claim, on behalf of the retailer, any bad debt allowance provided by this

22 basis and a retailer requests in writing the authority to report and pay sales tax on the accrual basis, the
23 department may grant the authority if assessment and collection of taxes are not jeopardized.
24
25 NEW SECTION. Section 35. Jeopardy assessment of sales tax. If the department believes that the

28 made, the department may file a lien and issue a distress warrant. The department may accept a bond from the

4 the responsibility of filing the returns or remitting tax payments are personally liable for the failure.
5 (2) The dissolution of a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability
6 partnership, or limited liability limited partnership does not discharge an officer, member-manager, manager, or
7 partner's liability for a prior failure of the corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership, limited liability
8 partnership, or limited liability limited partnership to file a return or remit the tax due. The sum due for a liability
9 may be assessed and collected as provided by law.

3 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
4 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
5 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
6 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in

12 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
13 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average

4 exceeding the limitation in subsection (1) in the guarantee account provided for in 20-9-622.
5 (4) (a) Subject to the limitation in subsection (1) and the conditions in subsection (4)(b), the
6 trustees shall budget and allocate the oil and natural gas production taxes anticipated by the district in any
7 budgeted fund at the discretion of the trustees. Oil and natural gas production taxes allocated to the district
8 general fund may be applied to the BASE or over-BASE portions of the general fund budget at the discretion of
9 the trustees.
10 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(c), if the trustees apply an amount less than 12.5% of the
11 total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior school fiscal year to the district's
12 general fund BASE budget for the upcoming school fiscal year, then:
13 (i) the trustees shall levy the number of mills required to raise an amount equal to the difference
14 between 12.5% of the oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior school fiscal year
15 and the amount of oil and natural gas production taxes the trustees budget in the district's general fund BASE
16 budget for the upcoming school fiscal year;
17 (ii) the mills levied under subsection (4)(b)(i) are not eligible for the guaranteed tax base subsidy
18 under the provisions of 20-9-366 through 20-9-369 ; and
19 (iii) the general fund BASE budget levy requirement calculated in 20-9-141 must be calculated as
20 though the trustees budgeted 12.5% of the oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the
21 prior year and the number of mills calculated in subsection (4)(b)(i) must be added to the number of mills
22 calculated in 20-9-141 (2).
23 (c) The provisions of subsection (4)(b) do not apply to the following:
24 (i) a district that has a maximum general fund budget of less than $1 million;
25 (ii) a district whose oil and natural gas revenue combined with its adopted general fund budget
26 totals 105% or less of its maximum general fund budget;
27 (iii) a district that has a maximum general fund budget of $1 million or more and was eligible for a
28 significant enrollment increase payment pursuant to 20-9-166 in the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal

1 year to which the provisions of this subsection (4) would otherwise apply; or
2 (iv) a district that has issued outstanding oil and natural gas revenue bonds. Funds received
3 pursuant to this section must first be applied by the district to payment of debt service obligations for oil and
4 natural gas revenue bonds for the next 12-month period.
5 (5) (a) The limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school district may retain under
6 subsection (1) must be increased for any school district that was eligible for a significant enrollment increase
7 payment pursuant to 20-9-166. The increase in the limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school
8 district may retain under subsection (1) applies in the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which
9 the district was eligible and must be calculated by multiplying $45,000 times each additional ANB used to
10 calculate the significant enrollment increase payment pursuant to 20-9-166, including the absorption factor
11 reduction.
12 (b) For a district in nonoperating status under 20-9-505, the maximum amount of oil and natural
13 gas production taxes that a school district may retain is 130% of the school district's maximum budget in the
14 district's most recent operating year, determined in accordance with 20-9-308.
15 (6) In any year in which the actual oil and natural gas production taxes received by a school district
16 are less than 50% of the total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior year, the
17 district may transfer money from any budgeted fund to its general fund in an amount not to exceed the amount

5 state equalization aid as provided in 20-9-343. At fiscal yearend, any fund balance in the account exceeding
6 what was appropriated must be transferred to the guarantee account established in 20-9-622 after the property
7 tax reductions under subsection (2) of this section.
8 (2) The account receives revenue as described in 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360 [sections 44
9 and 89]. Prior to levying school district property taxes or countywide school property taxes authorized under this
10 Title 20, the county commissioners shall request funding from the school equalization and property tax
11 reduction account to eliminate or reduce the need for property tax levies. The state treasurer shall approve

22 (j) school district levies in support of the technology acquisition and depreciation fund.
23 (3) Beginning in fiscal year 2025, each December the superintendent of public instruction shall

25 value of all property in the state reported by the department of revenue pursuant to 20-9-369 by 1,000 to
26 determine a statewide value mill and then multiplying that amount by 95 mills, or the number of mills calculated
27 by the department of revenue under 15-10-420 (8) for the applicable fiscal year. If the forecasted amount differs
28 from the amount determined through the same calculation in the prior fiscal year by $2 million or more and is:

2 (i) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school guaranteed
3 tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number determined by the
4 superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed to eligible school
5 districts equal to 85% of the decrease in the calculated amount between the 2 years; and
6 (ii) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school mill value
7 per ANB for school retirement guaranteed tax base purposes under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number
8 determined by the superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of retirement guaranteed tax base aid
9 distributed to eligible school districts equal to 15% of the decrease in the calculated amount between the 2
10 years;
11 (b) more, then the superintendent shall increase the multipliers used in the guaranteed tax base
12 formulas under 20-9-366 and in the formula for school major maintenance aid under 20-9-525 to the nearest
13 whole number by an amount calculated by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of
14 guaranteed tax base aid and school major maintenance aid distributed to eligible counties and school districts
15 equal to 55% of the increase in the calculated amount between the 2 years in the following order, with any
16 amount exceeding the caps under subsections (3)(b)(i) through (3)(b)(iii) flowing to the next mechanism:
17 (i) first, the multiplier used in calculating the statewide mill value per elementary and high school
18 ANB for retirement purposes, not to exceed 305%;
19 (ii) second, the multiplier used in calculating the amount of state school major maintenance aid
20 support for each dollar of local effort, not to exceed 365%; and

7 (1) "Amortization bond" means that form of bond on which a part of the principal is required to be
8 paid each time that interest becomes due and payable. The part payment of principal increases with each
9 following installment in the same amount that the interest payment decreases, so that the combined amount
10 payable on principal and interest is the same on each payment date. However, the payment on the initial
11 interest payment date may be less or greater than the amount of other payments on the bond, reflecting the
12 payment of interest only or the payment of interest for a period different from that between other interest
13 payment dates. The final payment may vary from prior payments in amount as a result of rounding prior
14 payments.
15 (2) "General obligation bonds" means bonds that pledge the full faith and credit and the taxing
16 power of a school district.
17 (3) "Impact aid revenue bonds" means bonds that pledge and are payable solely from federal
18 impact aid basic support payments received and deposited to the credit of the fund established in 20-9-514.
19 (4) "Oil and natural gas revenue bonds" means bonds that pledge and are payable from a first lien
20 on oil and natural gas production taxes received by a school district pursuant to 20-9-310. Oil and natural gas
21 revenue bonds to which a tax deficiency is pledged are not considered general obligation bonds that are eligible
22 to receive guaranteed tax base aid pursuant to 20-9-367 but are to be considered in determining the debt limit
23 of a school district for the purposes of 20-9-406.
24 (5) "Serial bonds" means a bond issue payable in annual installments of principal commencing not
25 more than 2 years from the date of issue, any one installment consisting of one or more bonds, with the
26 principal amount of bonds maturing or subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption in each installment,
27 commencing with the installment payable in the fourth year after the date of issue, not exceeding three times
28 the principal amount of the bonds payable in the immediately preceding installment."

- 123 - Authorized Print Version – SB 558

69th Legislature SB 558.1
1 amounts and, subject to adjustment under 20-9-336, multiply the result by 187%;
2 (B) multiply the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(i)(A) by the district's school major
3 maintenance amount;
4 (C) subtract the district's taxable valuation from the amount determined under subsection
5 (3)(a)(i)(B); and
6 (D) divide the amount determined under subsection (3)(a)(i)(C) by 1,000;

13 subtracting the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) from the district's school major maintenance
14 amount.
15 (b) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year greater than or equal to
16 97% of the district's general fund maximum budget in the prior year, the amount determined in subsection
17 (3)(a)(iv) rounded to the nearest cent is the amount of school major maintenance aid per dollar of local effort,
18 not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the district's school
19 major maintenance amount.
20 (c) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year less than 97% of the
21 district's maximum budget in the prior year, multiply the amount determined in subsection (3)(a)(iv) by the ratio
22 of the district's adopted general fund budget in the prior year to the district's maximum general fund budget in
23 the prior year. The result, rounded to the nearest cent, is the amount of state school major maintenance aid per
24 dollar of local effort, not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the
25 district's school major maintenance amount.
26 (4) Using the taxable valuation most recently determined by the department of revenue under 20-
27 9-369, the superintendent shall provide school districts with a preliminary estimated amount of state school

3 any school fiscal year are less than the amount for which school districts would otherwise qualify, the
4 superintendent of public instruction shall proportionally prorate the aid distributed to ensure that the distributions
5 do not exceed the appropriated or available funds.
6 (6) If in any fiscal year the amount of revenue in the school major maintenance aid account is
7 sufficient to fund school major maintenance aid without a proration reduction pursuant to subsection (5) and if in
8 that same fiscal year the amount of revenue available in the school facility and technology account established
9 in 20-9-516 will result in a proration reduction in debt service assistance pursuant to 20-9-346 (2)(b) for that
10 fiscal year, the state treasurer shall transfer any excess funds in the school major maintenance aid account to
11 the school facility and technology account, not to exceed the amount required to avoid a proration reduction.
