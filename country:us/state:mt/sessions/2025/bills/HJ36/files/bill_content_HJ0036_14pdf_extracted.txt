21 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
22 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
23 That Montana school districts be strongly encouraged to introduce cursive writing as early as
24 developmentally appropriate and to provide exposure to cursive throughout a student's school career, in part so
25 that students will be able to appreciate historical documents and different literacy formats.
26 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State send a copy of this resolution to the
27 Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Board of Public Education, and each public school board in Montana.
