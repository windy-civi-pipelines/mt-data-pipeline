5 individual action but not a class action under the rules of civil procedure in the district court of the county in
6 which the seller, lessor, or service provider resides or has its principal place of business or is doing business to
7 recover money damages in the amount of any ascertainable loss of money or property or $500, whichever is
8 greater. An individual claim may be brought in justice's court. The court may not award punitive damages but
9 may, in its discretion, award up to three times the money damages in the amount of any ascertainable loss of
10 money or property sustained, if actual damages do not exceed $100,000, and may provide any other equitable
11 relief that it considers necessary or proper.

24 hour. A person who brings an action on the person's own behalf without an attorney may receive attorney fees
25 at the judge's discretion.
26 (4) Any permanent injunction, judgment, or order of the court made under 30-14-111 is prima facie
27 evidence in an action brought under this section that the respondent used or employed a method, act, or
