4
5 A RESOLUTION OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF MONTANA URGING THE
6 PROTECTION OF MONTANA'S TRADITIONAL NOVEMBER MULE DEER HUNT.
7
8 WHEREAS, this resolution may be cited as the "Traditional November Mule Deer Hunt Protection
9 Resolution"; and
10 WHEREAS, the House of Representatives is the closest representation of the people of the state; and
11 WHEREAS, to increase populations of mule deer, antlerless harvest is minimized, and to decrease
12 populations of mule deer, antlerless harvest is maximized; and
13 WHEREAS, except to increase the buck-to-doe ratio at certain times, mule deer buck harvest is
14 generally not a major factor in population management; and
15 WHEREAS, Montana is unusual among the states in that, apart from the early 1900s, and despite
16 recurrent increases and decreases in mule deer populations, it has always allowed the harvest of mule deer
17 bucks during the rut period; and
18 WHEREAS, harvesting mule deer bucks during the rut gives hunters the opportunity to harvest a
19 mature deer, because older deer are more active at that time; and
20 WHEREAS, Montana hunters have long-standing personal and family traditions of hunting mule deer
21 during the rut; and
22 WHEREAS, Montana has hunting families whose traditions of hunting mule deer during the rut are
23 generational and culminate with Thanksgiving when families are together; and
24 WHEREAS, it is essential to preserve the long-standing opportunity and tradition of November mule
25 deer hunting and of mule deer buck harvest during the rut period while allowing the management of mule deer
26 buck harvest in hunting districts where it may be beneficial for population management; and
27 WHEREAS, between trophy management and opportunity management, Montana has historically
28 focused on providing greater opportunity for hunters; and

69th Legislature 2025 HR 6.1
1 WHEREAS, a Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks survey conducted in 2022 showed that 71% of
2 respondents either "support" or "strongly support" the timing of the current 5-week general rifle season for mule
3 deer, which is an increase of 10% in the "strongly support" category in the 11-year period after a similar survey
4 was conducted in 2011; and
5 WHEREAS, in the same 2022 survey, nearly two-thirds of respondents stated they "support" or
6 "strongly support" the hunting of mule deer bucks during the rut in Montana, while only 16% stated they
7 "oppose" or "strongly oppose" the hunt; and
8 WHEREAS, after nearly 10 decades of decreases and increases in mule deer populations, removing
9 the mule deer hunt from the month of November and removing the hunt permanently from the rut would be
10 drastic and not science based.
11
12 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
13 MONTANA:
14 That the House of Representatives urges the Fish and Wildlife Commission to strongly consider:
15 (1) retaining the cherished and long-held traditions of the November mule deer hunt, including
16 hunting mule deer bucks during the rut, and resisting the movement of the mule deer season earlier into the
17 month of October;
18 (2) keeping in mind the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks' survey results in which
19 respondents greatly supported the timing of the current mule deer hunting season;
20 (3) aggressively restricting the harvest of antlerless mule deer in regions where populations are
21 below the objective, or below the objective in the long-term average for a period of years, until populations
22 recover;
23 (4) restricting antlerless mule deer harvests until populations strengthen in districts that are at the
24 objective but are trending toward below the objective;
25 (5) restricting the harvest in no more than 20% of the districts in a given season, for no more than
26 two seasons within a 6-year period, and not earlier than November 6 in general hunting districts, in order to
27 retain opportunity for hunters if the commission decides to restrict the harvest of mule deer bucks during the rut;
28 (6) rotating any necessary restrictions as much as possible by district to continue providing

69th Legislature 2025 HR 6.1
1 opportunity for rut harvests in some areas of the state while other districts are restricted; and
2 (7) adding biological triggers to restrictive mule deer management, such as increasing the buck-to-
3 doe ratio in districts in which the buck-to-doe ratio has dropped below 15 bucks for every 100 does according to
4 postseason surveys.
5 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief Clerk of the House send a copy of this resolution to the
6 Governor and to each of the seven Commissioners of the Fish and Wildlife Commission.
