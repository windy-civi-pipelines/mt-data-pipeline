contractors for work of a similar character performed in that district by each craft, classification, or type of
worker needed to complete a contract under this part.
(5) (a) The contractor survey must include information pertaining to the number of skilled workers
employed in the contractor's peak month of employment and the wages and fringe benefits paid for each craft,

the department shall use a weighted average wage for each craft, classification, or type of work, except in those
cases in which the survey shows that at least 50% of the skilled workers are receiving the same wage.

type of work.
(6) The work performed must be work of a similar character to the work performed in the
applicable district unless the survey in the applicable district does not generate sufficient data. If the survey
produces insufficient data, the rate may be established by the use of other information or methods that the

prevailing rate of wages. The rules must include an alternate methodology to determine the standard prevailing
rate of wages whenever insufficient data is generated by the survey of contractors in the applicable district. The

standard prevailing rate of wages whenever insufficient data exists.
(c) The alternative method of determining the prevailing rate of wages must provide for review and
the incorporation of data from work of a similar character, which must be based on a survey that is conducted
as closely as possible to the original district.
