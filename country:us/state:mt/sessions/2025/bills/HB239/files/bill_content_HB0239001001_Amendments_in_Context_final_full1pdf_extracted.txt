11 (6) The work performed must be work of a similar character to the work performed in the
12 applicable district unless the survey in the applicable district does not generate sufficient data. If the survey
13 produces insufficient data, the rate may be established by the use of other information or methods that the
14 commissioner determines fairly establish the standard prevailing rate of wages.
15 (7) (a) The commissioner shall establish by rule the methodology for determining the standard
16 prevailing rate of wages. The rules must include an alternate methodology to determine the standard prevailing
17 rate of wages whenever insufficient data is generated by the survey of contractors in the applicable district. The
18 rules must identify the amount of data that constitutes insufficient data.
19 (b) The commissioner shall use an alternate methodology provided by rule to determine the
20 standard prevailing rate of wages whenever insufficient data exists.
21 (c) The alternative method of determining the prevailing rate of wages must provide for review and
22 the incorporation of data from work of a similar character, which must be based on a survey that is conducted
23 as closely as possible to the original district.
24 (8) Whenever work of a similar character is not being performed in the district, the standard
25 prevailing rate of wages, including fringe benefits and the rate of travel allowance, must be those rates
26 established by collective bargaining agreements in effect in the applicable district for each craft, classification,
27 or type of skilled worker needed to complete the contract."
