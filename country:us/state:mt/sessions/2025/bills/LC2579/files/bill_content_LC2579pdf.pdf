1 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
2 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
3 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
4 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
5 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
6 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
7 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the

10 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
11 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
12 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
13 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
14 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
15 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
16 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
17 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
18 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
19 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
20 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
21 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
22 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
23 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
24 for making the adjustment.

26 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or

4 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,

6 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
7 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
8 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
9 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
10 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
11 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
12 accordance with the board's order."
