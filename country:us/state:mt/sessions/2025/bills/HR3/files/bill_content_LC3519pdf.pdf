7
8 WHEREAS, online privacy and security is important to Montanans; and
9 WHEREAS, Montana prides itself in its robust privacy laws that protect the identities and financial
10 security of all Montanans, including laws related to online computer crimes, online privacy, and data security;
11 and
12 WHEREAS, the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a federal
13 organization created by executive order and not through an act of the United States Congress, recently gained
14 access to the federal digital infrastructure containing the names, addresses, social security numbers, and other
15 personally identifiable information of millions of American citizens, including thousands of Montanans; and
16 WHEREAS, due to uncertainties about the type of access gained by the DOGE, how the acquired
17 information will be used, and whether there will be any oversight of the DOGE, Americans are afraid that their
18 personally identifiable information is at risk, and many citizens are resorting to freezing their credit as a
19 precaution; and
20 WHEREAS, it is unacceptable to use personally identifiable information in any way that is not entirely
21 secure, and it is the responsibility of the federal government to provide that protection; and
22 WHEREAS, Montanans should have the same protections at the federal level against breaches of
23 personally identifiable information as they do at the state level.

25 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
26 MONTANA:
27 That the House of Representatives of the 69th Legislature request that the Montana Congressional
28 Delegation act immediately to secure all databases that contain personally identifiable information of
