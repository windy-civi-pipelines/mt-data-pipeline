11
12 WHEREAS, online privacy and security is important to Montanans; and

15 and
16 WHEREAS, the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a federal
17 organization created by executive order and not through an act of the United States Congress, recently gained
18 access to the federal digital infrastructure containing the names, addresses, social security numbers, and other
19 personally identifiable information of millions of American citizens, including thousands of Montanans; and
20 WHEREAS, due to uncertainties about the type of access gained by the DOGE, how the acquired

22 personally identifiable information is at risk, and many citizens are resorting to freezing their credit as a
23 precaution; and
24 WHEREAS, it is unacceptable to use personally identifiable information in any way that is not entirely
25 secure, and it is the responsibility of the federal government to provide that protection; and
26 WHEREAS, Montanans should have the same protections at the federal level against breaches of
27 personally identifiable information as they do at the state level.
