14 "46-14-301. Commitment upon finding of not guilty by reason of lack of mental state -- hearing
15 to determine release or discharge -- limitation on confinement. (1) When a defendant is found not guilty for

18 accordance with 46-18-112 and 46-18-113, which must include an investigation of the present mental condition
19 of the defendant. If the trial was by jury, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the appropriate disposition

12 disorder that renders the person a danger to the person or others. The hearing must be conducted by the court
13 that ordered the commitment unless that court transfers jurisdiction to the district court in the district in which
14 the person has been placed. The court shall cause notice of the hearing to be served upon the person, the
15 person's counsel, the prosecutor, and the court that originally ordered the commitment. The hearing is a civil
16 proceeding, and the burden is upon the state to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the person may
17 not be safely released because the person continues to suffer from a mental disease or disorder that causes
18 the person to present a substantial risk of:
