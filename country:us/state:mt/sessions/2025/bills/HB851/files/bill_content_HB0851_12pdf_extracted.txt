2 to determine release or discharge -- limitation on confinement. (1) When a defendant is found not guilty for
3 the reason that due to a mental disease or disorder the defendant could not have a particular state of mind that
4 is an essential element of the offense charged, the court shall order a predisposition investigation in
5 accordance with 46-18-112 and 46-18-113, which must include an investigation of the present mental condition
6 of the defendant. If the trial was by jury, the court shall hold a hearing to determine the appropriate disposition

8 considers necessary to determine the appropriate disposition of the defendant. In either case, the testimony
9 and evidence presented at the trial must be considered by the court in making its determination.
10 (2) The court shall evaluate the nature of the offense with which the defendant was charged. If the
11 offense:
12 (a) involved a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or death, actual bodily injury, or substantial

14 the defendant a danger to the defendant or others. If the court finds that the defendant presents a danger to the
15 defendant or others, the defendant may be committed to the custody of the director of the department of public

25 determine the person's present mental condition and whether the person must be discharged or released or
26 whether the commitment may be extended because the person continues to suffer from a mental disease or
27 disorder that renders the person a danger to the person or others. The hearing must be conducted by the court

1 the person has been placed. The court shall cause notice of the hearing to be served upon the person, the

3 proceeding, and the burden is upon the state to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the person may
4 not be safely released because the person continues to suffer from a mental disease or disorder that causes
5 the person to present a substantial risk of:
6 (a) serious bodily injury or death to the person or others;
7 (b) an imminent threat of physical injury to the person or others; or

14 expires, involuntary civil commitment proceedings may be instituted in the manner provided in Title 53, chapter
15 21.
16 (5) A professional person shall review the status of the person each year. At the time of the annual
17 review, the director of the department of public health and human services department of health services or the

3 the reason that due to a mental disease or disorder the defendant could not have a particular state of mind that
4 is an essential element of the offense charged, the court shall order a predisposition investigation in
5 accordance with 46-18-112 and 46-18-113, which must include an investigation of the present mental condition

8 considers necessary to determine the appropriate disposition of the defendant. In either case, the testimony
9 and evidence presented at the trial must be considered by the court in making its determination.
10 (2) The court shall evaluate the nature of the offense with which the defendant was charged. If the

14 expires, involuntary civil commitment proceedings may be instituted in the manner provided in Title 53, chapter
