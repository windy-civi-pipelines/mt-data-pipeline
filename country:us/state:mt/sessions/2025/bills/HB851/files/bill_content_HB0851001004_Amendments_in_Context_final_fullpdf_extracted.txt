15 has threatened, attempted, or inflicted physical harm on another and that unless committed is likely to inflict
16 physical harm on another or is incapacitated by alcohol. A refusal to undergo treatment does not constitute
17 evidence of lack of judgment as to the need for treatment. The petition must be accompanied by a certificate of
18 a licensed physician who has examined the person within 2 days before submission of the petition unless the
19 person whose commitment is sought has refused to submit to a medical examination, in which case the fact of

20 (9) The court shall inform the person whose commitment or recommitment is sought of the
21 person's right to contest the application, be represented by counsel at every stage of any proceedings relating
22 to the person's commitment and recommitment, and have assigned counsel pursuant to the Montana Public
