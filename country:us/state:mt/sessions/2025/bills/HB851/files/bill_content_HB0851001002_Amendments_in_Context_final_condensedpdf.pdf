1 (3) At the hearing, the court shall hear all relevant testimony, including, if possible, the testimony of
2 at least one licensed physician who has examined the person whose commitment is sought. The person has a
3 right to have a licensed physician of the person's own choosing conduct an examination and testify on the
4 person's behalf. If the person has no funds with which to pay the physician, the reasonable costs of one
5 examination and testimony must be paid by the county. The person must be present unless the court believes
6 that the person's presence is likely to be injurious to the person. The court shall examine the person in open
7 court or, if advisable, shall examine the person in chambers. If the person refuses an examination by a licensed
8 physician and there is sufficient evidence to believe that the allegations of the petition are true or if the court
9 believes that more medical evidence is necessary, the court may make a temporary order committing the
10 person to the department for a period of not more than 5 days for purposes of a diagnostic examination.
11 (4) If after hearing all relevant evidence, including the results of any diagnostic examination by the
12 department of public health and human services, the court finds that grounds for involuntary commitment have
13 been established by clear and convincing evidence, it shall make an order of commitment to the department.
14 The court may not order commitment of a person unless it determines that the department is able to provide
15 adequate and appropriate treatment for the person and that the treatment is likely to be beneficial.
16 (5) A person committed under this section must remain in the custody of the department for
17 treatment for a period of 40 days unless sooner discharged. At the end of the 40-day period, the person must
18 automatically be discharged unless before expiration of the period the department obtains a court order from
19 the district court of the committing district for the person's recommitment upon the grounds set forth in
20 subsection (1) for a further period of 90 days unless sooner discharged. If a person has been committed
21 because the person is an alcoholic likely to inflict physical harm on another, the department shall apply for
22 recommitment if after examination it is determined that the likelihood still exists.
23 (6) A person recommitted under subsection (5) who has not been discharged by the department
24 before the end of the 90-day period must be discharged at the expiration of that period unless before expiration
25 of the period the department obtains a court order from the district court of the committing district on the
26 grounds set forth in subsection (1) for recommitment for a further period not to exceed 90 days. If a person has
27 been committed because the person is an alcoholic likely to inflict physical harm on another, the department

3 (7) Upon the filing of a petition for recommitment under subsection (5) or (6), the court shall fix a
4 date for hearing no later than 10 days after the date the petition was filed. A copy of the petition and of the
5 notice of hearing, including the date fixed by the court, must be served on the petitioner, the person whose
6 commitment is sought, the person's next of kin other than the petitioner, the original petitioner under subsection
7 (1) if different from the petitioner for recommitment, one of the person's parents or the person's legal guardian if
8 the person is a minor, and any other person the court believes advisable. At the hearing, the court shall
9 proceed as provided in subsection (3).
10 (8) A person committed to the custody of the department for treatment must be discharged at any
11 time before the end of the period for which the person has been committed if either of the following conditions is
12 met:
13 (a) in case of an alcoholic committed on the grounds of likelihood of infliction of physical harm
14 upon another, that the person is no longer in need of treatment or the likelihood no longer exists; or
15 (b) in case of an alcoholic committed on the grounds of incapacity and the need of treatment, that
16 the incapacity no longer exists, further treatment will not be likely to bring about significant improvement in the
17 person's condition, or treatment is no longer adequate or appropriate.
18 (9) The court shall inform the person whose commitment or recommitment is sought of the
19 person's right to contest the application, be represented by counsel at every stage of any proceedings relating
20 to the person's commitment and recommitment, and have assigned counsel pursuant to the Montana Public
21 Defender Act, Title 47, chapter 1, if the person wants the assistance of counsel and is unable to obtain private
22 counsel. If the court believes that the person needs the assistance of counsel, the court shall order the office of
23 state public defender, provided for in 2-15-1029, to assign counsel for the person regardless of the person's
24 wishes. The person whose commitment or recommitment is sought must be informed of the right to be
25 examined by a licensed physician of the person's choice. If the person is unable to obtain a licensed physician
26 and requests examination by a physician, the court shall employ a licensed physician.
