5 examination and testimony must be paid by the county. The person must be present unless the court believes
6 that the person's presence is likely to be injurious to the person. The court shall examine the person in open

19 the district court of the committing district for the person's recommitment upon the grounds set forth in
20 subsection (1) for a further period of 90 days unless sooner discharged. If a person has been committed
21 because the person is an alcoholic likely to inflict physical harm on another, the department shall apply for
22 recommitment if after examination it is determined that the likelihood still exists.
23 (6) A person recommitted under subsection (5) who has not been discharged by the department
24 before the end of the 90-day period must be discharged at the expiration of that period unless before expiration
25 of the period the department obtains a court order from the district court of the committing district on the

7 (1) if different from the petitioner for recommitment, one of the person's parents or the person's legal guardian if
8 the person is a minor, and any other person the court believes advisable. At the hearing, the court shall
9 proceed as provided in subsection (3).
10 (8) A person committed to the custody of the department for treatment must be discharged at any
11 time before the end of the period for which the person has been committed if either of the following conditions is
12 met:
13 (a) in case of an alcoholic committed on the grounds of likelihood of infliction of physical harm
14 upon another, that the person is no longer in need of treatment or the likelihood no longer exists; or
15 (b) in case of an alcoholic committed on the grounds of incapacity and the need of treatment, that
16 the incapacity no longer exists, further treatment will not be likely to bring about significant improvement in the
17 person's condition, or treatment is no longer adequate or appropriate.
18 (9) The court shall inform the person whose commitment or recommitment is sought of the
19 person's right to contest the application, be represented by counsel at every stage of any proceedings relating
20 to the person's commitment and recommitment, and have assigned counsel pursuant to the Montana Public
21 Defender Act, Title 47, chapter 1, if the person wants the assistance of counsel and is unable to obtain private

23 state public defender, provided for in 2-15-1029, to assign counsel for the person regardless of the person's
24 wishes. The person whose commitment or recommitment is sought must be informed of the right to be
25 examined by a licensed physician of the person's choice. If the person is unable to obtain a licensed physician
26 and requests examination by a physician, the court shall employ a licensed physician.

1 Montana state hospital and the Montana mental health nursing care center must be deposited in a special
2 revenue fund and must be applied to the payment of the principal and interest payments due under the loan
3 agreement. Whenever the foregoing facility revenue exceeds the amount and terms specified and required to
4 repay the loan and maintain required reserves, the excess must be deposited as provided in 53-1-413. As long
5 as the loan remains outstanding and the state provides services for the mentally ill, the department shall use
6 the Montana state hospital and the Montana mental health nursing care center for those purposes or for other
7 purposes as permitted by the loan agreement and state law, except when foreclosure occurs under the
8 agreement or the mortgage. Notwithstanding the provisions of 77-2-302(1) and upon foreclosure of a mortgage
9 given to secure the loan agreement, there must be paid to the board of land commissioners as a first and prior
10 claim against the mortgaged land an amount equal to the full market value of the land as determined by the
11 board prior to the execution of the mortgage and after appraisal by a qualified land appraiser. The loan
12 agreement may contain other provisions or agreements that the department determines are necessary and that
13 are not inconsistent with the provisions of Title 90, chapter 7.
14 (3) The obligations of the department under the agreement are special limited obligations payable
15 solely from the facility revenue of the Montana state hospital and the Montana mental health nursing care
16 center and do not constitute a debt of the state or obligate the state to appropriate or apply any funds or
17 revenue of the state, except the facility revenue as provided in this section."
