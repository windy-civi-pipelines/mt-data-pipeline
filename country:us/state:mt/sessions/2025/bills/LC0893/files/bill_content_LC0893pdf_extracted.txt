13 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
14
15 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Short title. [Sections 1 through 9] may be cited as the "Preborn Infants
16 Dignity Act".
17
18 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Legislative findings and purpose. (1) The legislature finds that:
19 (a) deceased preborn infants deserve the same respect and dignity as all other human beings;
20 (b) the laws of this state do not ensure that a miscarried, stillborn, or aborted preborn infant
21 receives a proper burial or other respectful final disposition;
22 (c) the laws of this state also fail to require fetal death reporting and the issuance of fetal death
23 certificates except as required by 46-4-114, 46-4-120, and 50-15-403;
24 (d) the loss of a preborn infant at any stage of development is often devastating to parents and the
25 laws of this state offer certificates of birth resulting in stillbirth under 50-15-208 to parents for fetal deaths that
26 occur;
27 (e) the laws of this state do not explicitly prohibit the sale, transfer, distribution, or donation of the
28 bodily remains of aborted preborn infants for experimentation; and

69th Legislature 2025 LC0893.1
1 (f) it is the public policy of this state to promote childbirth over abortion. Permitting the sale,
2 transfer, distribution, or donation of the bodily remains of aborted preborn infants, particularly for pecuniary
3 gain, and the use of the bodies of aborted preborn infants for experimentation violates this state's public policy.
4 (2) Based on the findings in subsection (1), the purposes of [sections 1 through 9] are to:
5 (a) ensure that the mother of the deceased preborn infant is given the opportunity to bury or
6 dispose of the bodily remains of her infant with dignity and respect;
7 (b) require institutions where deceased preborn infants are delivered or where preborn infants are
8 aborted to provide a dignified final disposition of the bodily remains of these infants;
9 (c) require fetal death reports for all fetal deaths as defined in [section 3];
10 (d) ensure that parents of all stillborn infants are offered the opportunity to obtain a certificate of
11 birth resulting in stillbirth;
12 (e) prohibit the sale, transfer, distribution, or other unlawful disposition of the bodily remains of a
13 deceased preborn infant, the bodily remains of an aborted preborn infant, or the bodily remains of an infant
14 born alive who later dies as the result of a failed abortion procedure; and
15 (f) ensure that the bodily remains of a deceased preborn infant resulting from an occurrence other
16 than an abortion are not sold, transferred, or distributed for experimentation without the mother's informed,
17 written consent.

13 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
14
15 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Short title. [Sections 1 through 9] may be cited as the "Preborn Infants
16 Dignity Act".
17
18 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Legislative findings and purpose. (1) The legislature finds that:
19 (a) deceased preborn infants deserve the same respect and dignity as all other human beings;
20 (b) the laws of this state do not ensure that a miscarried, stillborn, or aborted preborn infant
21 receives a proper burial or other respectful final disposition;
22 (c) the laws of this state also fail to require fetal death reporting and the issuance of fetal death
23 certificates except as required by 46-4-114, 46-4-120, and 50-15-403;
24 (d) the loss of a preborn infant at any stage of development is often devastating to parents and the
25 laws of this state offer certificates of birth resulting in stillbirth under 50-15-208 to parents for fetal deaths that
26 occur;
27 (e) the laws of this state do not explicitly prohibit the sale, transfer, distribution, or donation of the
28 bodily remains of aborted preborn infants for experimentation; and
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – ****

69th Legislature 2025 LC0893.1
1 (f) it is the public policy of this state to promote childbirth over abortion. Permitting the sale,
2 transfer, distribution, or donation of the bodily remains of aborted preborn infants, particularly for pecuniary
3 gain, and the use of the bodies of aborted preborn infants for experimentation violates this state's public policy.
4 (2) Based on the findings in subsection (1), the purposes of [sections 1 through 9] are to:
5 (a) ensure that the mother of the deceased preborn infant is given the opportunity to bury or
6 dispose of the bodily remains of her infant with dignity and respect;
7 (b) require institutions where deceased preborn infants are delivered or where preborn infants are
8 aborted to provide a dignified final disposition of the bodily remains of these infants;
