5 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT REQUIRING A STUDY OF STATE FIRE SUPPRESSION ISSUES,
6 METHODS, AND COSTS; PROVIDING AN APPROPRIATION; ESTABLISHING REPORTING
7 REQUIREMENTS; PROVIDING FOR CONTINGENT VOIDNESS; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE
8 EFFECTIVE DATE AND A TERMINATION DATE.”
9
10 WHEREAS, since the destructive Big Burn of 1910, federal wildfire policy has been to suppress fires at
11 all costs, resulting in forests that are overstocked with fuel; and
12 WHEREAS, wildfires now consume twice as much land each year on average than in the 1990s, a
13 trend expected to continue; and
14 WHEREAS, more than one-third of Montana homes are exposed to moderate to high wildfire risk; and
15 WHEREAS, a variety of factors have exacerbated the risks, including regulatory red tape, incomplete
16 government partnerships, unexplored economic benefits, and unrecognized risk sharing; and
17 WHEREAS, environmental reviews, endangered species concerns, and pernicious litigation prevent
18 necessary mechanical treatment and prescribed burns, which could lessen ladder and canopy fuels, reduce
19 fuel loads, and improve habitat; and
20 WHEREAS, profitable markets for shrubs and small-diameter trees may be developed in engineered-
21 wood plants to produce oriented-strand board, biochar, or wood chips; and
22 WHEREAS, use of prescribed fires as a management tool should be encouraged, perhaps as a
23 recognized property right, expanded liability protections, or certified burning; and
24 WHEREAS, as the number of homes in areas with moderate or high wildfire risk has doubled since
25 1990, volunteer, local, state, and federal authorities are faced with protecting these structures; and
26 WHEREAS, improved cooperation between states, tribes, and counties can together improve forest
27 health and reduce wildfire risk; and
28 WHEREAS, use of all resources should be examined to maximize private, local government, and state

13 (c) the impact of operations on private land and the effective use of private resources to fight fires;
14 and
15 (d) state and federal forest management policies and how those policies may potentially contribute
