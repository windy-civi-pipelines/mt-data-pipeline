of ownership without displaying the registration and validation decals decal required by subsection (1) if, when
the motorboat or sailboat is operated during those 40 consecutive calendar days, a temporary registration
permit has been issued under 61-3-224 and is shown to a warden or other officer upon request."
Section 3. Section 23-2-512, MCA, is amended to read:
"23-2-512. Identifying number. (1) The owner of each motorboat, sailboat, or personal watercraft
requiring numbering by this state shall file an application for number in the office of the county treasurer in the
county where the motorboat, sailboat, or personal watercraft is owned, on forms prepared and furnished by the
department of justice. The application must be signed by the owner of the motorboat, sailboat, or personal
watercraft and be accompanied by the fee prescribed in 61-3-321(10). Any alteration, change, or false
statement contained in the application renders the certificate of number void. Upon receipt of the application in
approved form, the county treasurer shall issue to the applicant a certificate of number prepared and furnished
by the department of justice, stating the identifying number assigned to the motorboat, sailboat, or personal
watercraft and the name and address of the owner. Validation decals verifying the identifying number for each
motorboat, sailboat, or personal watercraft must be issued along with the certificate of The identifying number
and must be displayed on the motorboat, sailboat, or personal watercraft.
(2) The fine for failing to display the validation decals may not be more than the cost incurred by
the justice's court.
(3) The department may give only verbal or written warnings until December 31, 2007, for failing to
display validation decals in an attempt to educate the boating public.
(4)(2) If the ownership of a motorboat, sailboat, or personal watercraft changes, a new application
form with the certification fee must be filed within 40 days with the county treasurer and a new certificate of
number assigned in the same manner as provided for in an original assignment of number. New validation

decals must be issued simultaneously.
(5)(3) If an agency of the United States government has in force a comprehensive system of
identification numbering for motorboats in the United States, the numbering system employed pursuant to this
part by the department of justice must be in conformity.
(6) A certificate of number and validation decals issued under this part are effective unless
terminated or discontinued in accordance with the provisions of this part. All motorboats, sailboats, or personal
watercraft already numbered must exhibit validation decals by December 31, 2005. All validation decals expire
on February 28, 2008. Validation decals must be obtained by the expiration date at any regional office of the
department or through the department website and are in effect for another 3-year period ending February 28,
2011. The requirement of renewal validation decals must continue in subsequent 3-year periods, and renewal
validation decals must be identified by color in accordance with the federal numbering system. Except as
provided in 23-2-511(2) and subsection (4) of this section, the operation of a motorboat, sailboat, or personal
watercraft is prohibited without current validation decals.
(7) Validation decals must be approximately 3 square inches. The validation decals must be
serially numbered in accordance with the federal numbering system and must be displayed on each side of the
vessel.
(8)(4) If ownership is transferred, the purchaser shall notify the county treasurer within 40 days of the
acquisition of all or any part of the purchaser's interest, other than the creation of a security interest, in a
motorboat, sailboat, or personal watercraft numbered in this state or of the loss, theft, destruction, or
abandonment of the motorboat, sailboat, or personal watercraft. The transfer, loss, theft, destruction, or
abandonment terminates the certificate of number for the motorboat, sailboat, or personal watercraft. Recovery
from theft or transfer of a part interest that does not affect the owner's right to operate the motorboat, sailboat,
or personal watercraft does not terminate the certificate of number.
(9)(5) A holder of a certificate of number shall notify the county treasurer within a reasonable time if
the holder's address no longer conforms to the address appearing on the certificate and shall furnish the county
treasurer with the new address. The department of justice may provide by rule for the surrender of the
certificate bearing the former address and its replacement with a certificate bearing the new address or the
alteration of an outstanding certificate to show the new address of the holder.
