4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT GENERALLY REVISING LAWS RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY;
5 CREATING THE RIGHT TO COMPUTE ACT; REQUIRING SHUTDOWN CAPABILITIES A RISK
6 MANAGEMENT POLICY FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITIES CONTROLLED BY AN
7 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM; PROVIDING DEFINITIONS; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE
8 EFFECTIVE DATE.”

10 WHEREAS, innovations in computational technology, such as machine learning, enable technological
11 breakthroughs in nearly every sector, leading to increased economic growth and greater prosperity; and
12 WHEREAS, ensuring the United States remains at the forefront of computational technology is critical
13 for driving economic growth, safeguarding national security, and retaining a competitive edge over adversarial
14 nations; and
15 WHEREAS, while recognizing the benefits of recent innovations in computational technologies,
16 technology industry leaders have also expressed concern that some applications of powerful computational
17 resources may pose a high risk to public health and safety; and
18 WHEREAS, federal and state governments increasingly propose far-reaching restrictions on the ability
19 to privately own or make use of computational resources for lawful purposes, some of which may infringe on
20 fundamental constitutional rights to property and free expression; and
21 WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature is the proper branch of government to establish policies and
22 principles relating to the ability to own and make use of computational resources within the context of state
23 constitutional provisions.

1 Act".
2
3 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Legislative findings -- intent. The legislature finds that the rights to
4 acquire, possess, and protect property under Article II, section 3, of the Montana constitution, and the freedom
5 of expression under Article II, section 7, of the Montana constitution, also embody the notion of a fundamental
6 right to own and make use of technological tools, including computational resources. Any restrictions placed by
7 the government on the ability to privately own or make use of computational resources for lawful purposes must
8 be limited to those demonstrably necessary and narrowly tailored to fulfill a compelling government interest in
9 public health or safety.
10
11 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Right to compute. Government actions that restrict the ability to
12 privately own or make use of computational resources for lawful purposes, which infringes on citizens'
13 fundamental rights to property and free expression, must be limited to those demonstrably necessary and
14 narrowly tailored to fulfill a compelling government interest in public health or safety.
15
16 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Infrastructure controlled by critical artificial intelligence system --
17 shutdown. (1) When critical infrastructure facilities are controlled in whole or in part by an a critical artificial
18 intelligence system, the deployer shall ensure the capability to disable the artificial intelligence system's control
19 over the infrastructure and revert to human control within a reasonable amount of time.
20 (2) When enacting a full shutdown, the deployer shall consider, as appropriate, disruptions to
21 critical infrastructure that may result from a shutdown.
22 (3) Deployers shall implement, annually review, and test a risk management policy that includes a
23 fallback mechanism and a redundancy and mitigation plan to ensure the deployer can continue operations and
24 maintain control of the critical infrastructure facility without the use of the artificial intelligence system develop a
25 risk management policy after deploying the system that is reasonable and considers guidance and standards in
26 the latest version of the artificial intelligence risk management framework from the national institute of
27 standards and technology, the ISO/IEC 4200 artificial intelligence standard from the international organization

1 for standardization, or another nationally or internationally recognized risk management framework for artificial
2 intelligence systems. A plan prepared under federal requirements constitutes compliance with this section.

4 NEW SECTION. Section 5. Preservation of intellectual property. Nothing in [sections 1 through 7]
5 may be construed to alter, diminish, or interfere with the rights and remedies available under federal or state

9 construed to preempt federal laws.
10
11 NEW SECTION. Section 7. Definitions. As used in [sections 1 through 7], the following definitions
12 apply:
13 (1) "Artificial intelligence system" means any machine learning-based system that, for any explicit
14 or implicit objective, infers from the inputs the system receives how to generate outputs, including but not
15 limited to content, decisions, predictions, and recommendations that can influence physical or virtual
16 environments.
17 (2) "Compelling government interest in public health or safety" means a government interest of the
18 highest order in protecting the health and safety of the public that cannot be achieved through less restrictive
19 means. This includes but is not limited to:
20 (a) ensuring that a critical infrastructure facilities facility controlled by an artificial intelligence
21 system can be shut down and the critical infrastructure facility can be returned to human control develops a risk
22 management policy;
23 (b) addressing conduct that deceives or defrauds the public;
24 (c) protecting individuals, especially minors, from harm by a person who distributes deepfakes and
25 other harmful synthetic content with actual knowledge of the nature of that material; and
26 (d) taking actions that prevent or abate common law nuisances created by physical datacenter
27 infrastructure.
