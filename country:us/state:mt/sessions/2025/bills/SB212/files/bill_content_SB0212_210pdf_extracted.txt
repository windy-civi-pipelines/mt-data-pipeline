3
4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT GENERALLY REVISING LAWS RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY;
5 CREATING THE RIGHT TO COMPUTE ACT; REQUIRING SHUTDOWN CAPABILITIES A RISK
6 MANAGEMENT POLICY FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITIES CONTROLLED BY AN
7 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM; PROVIDING DEFINITIONS; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE
8 EFFECTIVE DATE.”
9
10 WHEREAS, innovations in computational technology, such as machine learning, enable technological
11 breakthroughs in nearly every sector, leading to increased economic growth and greater prosperity; and
12 WHEREAS, ensuring the United States remains at the forefront of computational technology is critical
13 for driving economic growth, safeguarding national security, and retaining a competitive edge over adversarial
14 nations; and
15 WHEREAS, while recognizing the benefits of recent innovations in computational technologies,
16 technology industry leaders have also expressed concern that some applications of powerful computational
17 resources may pose a high risk to public health and safety; and
18 WHEREAS, federal and state governments increasingly propose far-reaching restrictions on the ability
19 to privately own or make use of computational resources for lawful purposes, some of which may infringe on
20 fundamental constitutional rights to property and free expression; and
21 WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature is the proper branch of government to establish policies and
22 principles relating to the ability to own and make use of computational resources within the context of state
23 constitutional provisions.

25 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
26
27 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Short title. [Sections 1 through 7] may be cited as the "Right to Compute
28 Act".

69th Legislature 2025 SB0212.2
1
2 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Legislative findings -- intent. The legislature finds that the rights to
3 acquire, possess, and protect property under Article II, section 3, of the Montana constitution, and the freedom
4 of expression under Article II, section 7, of the Montana constitution, also embody the notion of a fundamental
5 right to own and make use of technological tools, including computational resources. Any restrictions placed by
6 the government on the ability to privately own or make use of computational resources for lawful purposes must
7 be limited to those demonstrably necessary and narrowly tailored to fulfill a compelling government interest in
8 public health or safety.
9
10 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Right to compute. Government actions that restrict the ability to
11 privately own or make use of computational resources for lawful purposes, which infringes on citizens'
12 fundamental rights to property and free expression, must be limited to those demonstrably necessary and
13 narrowly tailored to fulfill a compelling government interest in public health or safety.
14
15 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Infrastructure controlled by CRITICAL artificial intelligence system --
16 shutdown. (1) When critical infrastructure facilities are controlled in whole or in part by an A CRITICAL artificial
17 intelligence system, the deployer shall ensure the capability to disable the artificial intelligence system's control
18 over the infrastructure and revert to human control within a reasonable amount of time.
19 (2) When enacting a full shutdown, the deployer shall consider, as appropriate, disruptions to
20 critical infrastructure that may result from a shutdown.
21 (3) Deployers shall implement, annually review, and test a risk management policy that includes a
22 fallback mechanism and a redundancy and mitigation plan to ensure the deployer can continue operations and
23 maintain control of the critical infrastructure facility without the use of the artificial intelligence system DEVELOP A
24 RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY AFTER DEPLOYING THE SYSTEM THAT IS REASONABLE AND CONSIDERS GUIDANCE AND
