COMPUTE ACT; REQUIRING SHUTDOWN CAPABILITIES A RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY FOR CRITICAL
INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITIES CONTROLLED BY AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM; PROVIDING
DEFINITIONS; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE.”
WHEREAS, innovations in computational technology, such as machine learning, enable technological
breakthroughs in nearly every sector, leading to increased economic growth and greater prosperity; and
WHEREAS, ensuring the United States remains at the forefront of computational technology is critical
for driving economic growth, safeguarding national security, and retaining a competitive edge over adversarial
nations; and
WHEREAS, while recognizing the benefits of recent innovations in computational technologies,
technology industry leaders have also expressed concern that some applications of powerful computational
resources may pose a high risk to public health and safety; and
WHEREAS, federal and state governments increasingly propose far-reaching restrictions on the ability
to privately own or make use of computational resources for lawful purposes, some of which may infringe on
fundamental constitutional rights to property and free expression; and
WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature is the proper branch of government to establish policies and
principles relating to the ability to own and make use of computational resources within the context of state
constitutional provisions.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:

Section 2:
Section 1. Short title. [Sections 1 through 7] may be cited as the "Right to Compute Act".

ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 212

Section 3:
Section 2. Legislative findings -- intent. The legislature finds that the rights to acquire, possess,
and protect property under Article II, section 3, of the Montana constitution, and the freedom of expression
under Article II, section 7, of the Montana constitution, also embody the notion of a fundamental right to own
and make use of technological tools, including computational resources. Any restrictions placed by the
government on the ability to privately own or make use of computational resources for lawful purposes must be
limited to those demonstrably necessary and narrowly tailored to fulfill a compelling government interest in
public health or safety.

Section 4:
Section 3. Right to compute. Government actions that restrict the ability to privately own or make
use of computational resources for lawful purposes, which infringes on citizens' fundamental rights to property
and free expression, must be limited to those demonstrably necessary and narrowly tailored to fulfill a
compelling government interest in public health or safety.

Section 5:
Section 4. Infrastructure controlled by CRITICAL artificial intelligence system -- shutdown. (1)
When critical infrastructure facilities are controlled in whole or in part by an a critical artificial intelligence
system, the deployer shall ensure the capability to disable the artificial intelligence system's control over the
infrastructure and revert to human control within a reasonable amount of time.
(2) When enacting a full shutdown, the deployer shall consider, as appropriate, disruptions to
critical infrastructure that may result from a shutdown.
(3) Deployers shall implement, annually review, and test a risk management policy that includes a
fallback mechanism and a redundancy and mitigation plan to ensure the deployer can continue operations and
maintain control of the critical infrastructure facility without the use of the artificial intelligence system develop a
risk management policy after deploying the system that is reasonable and considers guidance and standards in
the latest version of the artificial intelligence risk management framework from the national institute of
standards and technology, the ISO/IEC 4200 artificial intelligence standard from the international organization
for standardization, or another nationally or internationally recognized risk management framework for artificial
intelligence systems. A plan prepared under federal requirements constitutes compliance with this section.

preempt federal laws.

Section 8:
Section 7. Definitions. As used in [sections 1 through 7], the following definitions apply:
(1) "Artificial intelligence system" means any machine learning-based system that, for any explicit
or implicit objective, infers from the inputs the system receives how to generate outputs, including but not
limited to content, decisions, predictions, and recommendations that can influence physical or virtual
environments.
(2) "Compelling government interest in public health or safety" means a government interest of the
highest order in protecting the health and safety of the public that cannot be achieved through less restrictive
means. This includes but is not limited to:
(a) ensuring that a critical infrastructure facilities facility controlled by an artificial intelligence
system can be shut down and the critical infrastructure facility can be returned to human control develops a risk
management policy;
(b) addressing conduct that deceives or defrauds the public;
(c) protecting individuals, especially minors, from harm by a person who distributes deepfakes and
other harmful synthetic content with actual knowledge of the nature of that material; and
(d) taking actions that prevent or abate common law nuisances created by physical datacenter
infrastructure.
(3) "Computational resources" means any tools, technologies, systems, or infrastructure, whether
digital, analog, existing, or some other form, that facilitate any form of computation, data processing, storage,
transmission, manipulation, control, creation, dissemination, or use of information and data. This includes but is
not limited to hardware, software, algorithms, sensors, networks, protocols, platforms, services, systems,
cryptography, machine learning, or quantum applications.
