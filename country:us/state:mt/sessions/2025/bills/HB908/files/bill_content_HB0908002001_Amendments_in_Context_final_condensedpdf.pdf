19 allowed by this section for the tax year exceeds the taxpayer's tax liability for the current tax year, the excess

21 exceed 10 years from the tax year the credit was claimed. The entire amount of unused credit must be carried
22 forward to the earliest of the succeeding years, and the oldest available unused credit must be used first. Any
23 credit remaining 10 years after the tax year for which the credit is based may not be refunded or credited to the
24 taxpayer.
25 (4) The credit may be claimed for up to 7 years, but only in a tax year in which the department of
