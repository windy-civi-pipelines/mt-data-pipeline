allowed by this section for the tax year exceeds the taxpayer's tax liability for the current tax year, the excess
attributable to the current tax year's credit is a credit carryover to succeeding tax years for a period not to
exceed 10 years from the tax year the credit was claimed. The entire amount of unused credit must be carried
forward to the earliest of the succeeding years, and the oldest available unused credit must be used first. Any
credit remaining 10 years after the tax year for which the credit is based may not be refunded or credited to the
taxpayer.
