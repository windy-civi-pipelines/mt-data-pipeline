13 SECTION 1. Section 15-30-2357, MCA, is amended to read:
14 "15-30-2357. Tax credit for hiring registered apprentice or veteran apprentice. (1) Subject to the
15 provisions of [ 15-30-2361 (8) and] 39-6-109, a taxpayer is allowed a credit against the tax imposed by chapter
16 31 or this chapter for employing a registered apprentice or registered veteran apprentice who works in
17 Montana.
18 (2) The credit may not exceed the taxpayer's tax liability and may not be carried forward or carried
19 back.
20 (3) The credit may be claimed only in the tax year in which the department of labor and industry
21 approved the credit as provided in 39-6-109(4). If a taxpayer claims the credit but was not approved by the
22 department of labor and industry, the taxpayer's return must be processed without regard to the credit.
23 (4) For fiscal year filers, the credit available to claim in the current fiscal year is the credit allowed
24 for the calendar year that ends within the taxpayer's fiscal period.
25 (5) Subject to the probationary period provided for in 39-6-109, if an employer employs an
26 apprentice for less than the full preceding calendar year, the employer may apply for the full credit for the year
27 in which the apprentice was employed.
28 (6) The department shall, after consultation with the department of labor and industry, prescribe a

69th Legislature 2025 HB0908.2
1 form for a taxpayer to claim the tax credit. The form must provide the department with sufficient information for
2 the proper administration of the credit.
3 (7) The department shall provide the department of labor and industry an annual report detailing
4 the tax credit provided to employers for the previous year. The information provided to the department of labor
5 and industry is subject to the provisions of 15-30-2618 and 15-31-511.
6 (8) The department may adopt rules, prepare forms, and maintain records that are necessary to

9 SECTION 2. Section 15-30-2361, MCA, is amended to read:

11 Subject to the provisions of 39-11-404, a taxpayer is allowed an annual job growth incentive tax credit against
12 the tax imposed by chapter 31 or this chapter for creating qualifying net employee growth in the state.
13 (2) The amount of the credit is equal to 50% of the taxpayer's total estimated taxes imposed on the
14 taxpayer each year for the Montana source wages paid to qualifying new employees in the credit certificate
15 under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, 26 U.S.C. 3111(a) and (b).
16 (3) The credit allowed by this section may not be refunded if the taxpayer has a tax liability less
17 than the amount of the credit. If the sum of credit carryovers from the credit, if any, and the amount of credit
18 allowed by this section for the tax year exceeds the taxpayer's tax liability for the current tax year, the excess
19 attributable to the current tax year's credit is a credit carryover to succeeding tax years for a period not to
20 exceed 10 years from the tax year the credit was claimed. The entire amount of unused credit must be carried
21 forward to the earliest of the succeeding years, and the oldest available unused credit must be used first. Any
22 credit remaining 10 years after the tax year for which the credit is based may not be refunded or credited to the
23 taxpayer.
24 (4) The credit may be claimed for up to 7 years, but only in a tax year in which the department of
25 labor and industry approved the credit by issuing the taxpayer with a credit certificate as provided in 39-11-404.
26 If a taxpayer claims the credit but was not approved by the department of labor and industry, the taxpayer's
27 return will be processed without regard to the credit.
28 (5) For fiscal year filers, the credit available to claim in the current fiscal year is the credit allowed

10 15-30-2357, 15-31-173, and 39-6-109 in the same tax year that this credit is claimed. This subsection does not
11 prevent a credit carryover from this credit from being used in a tax year in which the apprenticeship tax credit is
12 claimed.
13 (9) (8) Each biennium, the department shall provide to the revenue interim committee information
14 regarding all approvals granted and credit certificates issued, including the credits claimed, the names of the
