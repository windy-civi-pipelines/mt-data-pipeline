10
11 Section 1. Section 82-4-232, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "82-4-232. Area mining required -- bond -- alternative plan. (1) (a) Area strip mining, a method of
13 operation that does not produce a bench or fill bench, is required where strip mining is proposed. The area of
14 land affected must be backfilled and graded to the approximate original contour of the land. However:
15 (i) consistent with the adjacent unmined landscape elements, the operator may propose and the
16 department may approve regraded topography gentler than premining topography in order to enhance the
17 postmining land use and develop a postmining landscape that will provide greater moisture retention, greater
18 stability, and reduced soil losses from runoff and erosion;
19 (ii) postmining slopes may not exceed the angle of repose or lesser slope as is necessary to
20 achieve a long-term static safety factor of 1.3 or greater and to prevent slides;
21 (iii) permanent impoundments may be approved if they are suitable for the postmining land use
22 and otherwise meet the requirements of this part, as provided by department rules; and
23 (iv) reclaimed topography must be suitable for the approved postmining land use.
24 (b) Spoil from the first cut is not required to be transported to the last cut if highwalls are
25 eliminated, box cut spoils are graded to blend in with the surrounding terrain, and the approximate original
26 contour of the land is achieved.
27 (c) When directed by the department, the operator shall construct in the final grading diversion
28 ditches, depressions, or terraces that will accumulate or control the water runoff.

69th Legislature 2025 LC 2309
1 (2) In addition to the backfilling and grading requirements, the operator's method of operation on
2 steep slopes may be regulated and controlled according to rules adopted by the department. These rules may
3 require any measure to accomplish the purpose of this part.
4 (3) For coal mining on prime farmlands, the department shall establish by rule specifications for
5 soil removal, storage, replacement, and reconstruction, and the operator must as a minimum be required to:
6 (a) (i) segregate the A horizon of the natural soil, except when it can be shown that other available
7 soil materials will create a final soil having a greater productive capacity; and
8 (ii) if not used immediately, stockpile this material separately from other spoil and provide needed
9 protection from wind and water erosion or contamination by other acid or toxic material;
10 (b) (i) segregate the B horizon of the natural soil, or underlying C horizon or other strata, or a
11 combination of the horizons or other strata that are shown to be both texturally and chemically suitable for plant
12 growth and that can be shown to be equally or more favorable for plant growth than the B horizon in sufficient
13 quantities to create in the regraded final soil a root zone of comparable depth and quality to that that existed in
14 the natural soil; and
15 (ii) if not used immediately, stockpile this material separately from other spoil and provide needed
16 protection from wind and water erosion or contamination by acid or toxic material;
17 (c) replace and regrade the root zone material described in subsection (3)(b) with proper
18 compaction and uniform depth over the regraded spoil material; and
19 (d) redistribute and grade in a uniform manner the surface soil horizon described in subsection
20 (3)(a).
21 (4) All available topsoil must be removed in a separate layer, guarded from erosion and pollution,
22 and kept in a condition so that it can sustain vegetation of at least the quality and variety it sustained prior to
23 removal. However, the operator shall accord substantially the same treatment to any subsurface deposit of
24 material that is capable, as determined by the department, of supporting surface vegetation virtually as well as
25 the present topsoil. After the operation has been backfilled and graded, the topsoil or the best available
26 subsurface deposit of material that is best able to support vegetation must be returned as the top layer.
27 (5) As determined by rules of the department, time limits must be established requiring backfilling,
28 grading, subsidence stabilization, water control, highwall reduction, topsoiling, planting, and revegetation to be
- 2 - LC 2309
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2309
1 kept current. All backfilling, subsidence stabilization, sealing, grading, and topsoiling must be completed before
2 necessary equipment is moved from the operation.
3 (6) (a) (i) The permittee may file an application with the department for the release of all or part of
4 a performance bond. The application must contain a proposed public notice of the precise location of the land
5 affected, the number of acres for which bond release is sought, the permit and the date approved, the amount
6 of the bond filed and the portion sought to be released, the type and appropriate dates of reclamation work
7 performed, and a description of the results achieved as they relate to the permittee's approved reclamation
8 plan. The description of the results may include other information or methods, including predictive modeling,
9 which may be used in conjunction with monitoring data compiled for the performance bond release application
10 to demonstrate compliance with the approved reclamation plan.
11 (ii) In addition, as As part of any bond release application, the permittee shall submit copies of
12 letters that the permittee has sent to adjoining property owners, local governmental bodies, planning agencies,
13 and sewage and water treatment authorities or water companies in the locality of the operation, notifying them
14 of the permittee's intention to seek release from the bond.
15 (b) The department shall determine whether the application is administratively complete. An
16 application is administratively complete if it includes:
17 (i) the location and acreage of the land for which bond release is sought;
18 (ii) the amount of bond release sought;
19 (iii) a description of the completed reclamation, including the date of performance;
20 (iv) a discussion of how the results of the completed reclamation satisfy the requirements of the
21 approved reclamation plan, which may include a description of other information or methods, including
22 predictive modeling, which may be used in conjunction with monitoring data for the purposes of demonstrating
23 compliance with the approved reclamation plan; and
24 (v) information required by rules implementing this part.
25 (c) The department shall notify the applicant in writing of its determination no later than 60 days
26 after submittal of the application. If the department determines that the application is not administratively
27 complete, it shall specify in the notice those items that the application must address. After an application for
28 bond release has been determined to be administratively complete by the department, the permittee shall

69th Legislature 2025 LC 2309
1 release sought; or
2 (iii) a material change in the reclamation for which a bond release is sought or the information used
3 to evaluate the results of that reclamation.
4 (h) The department shall, within 30 days of determining that the application is administratively
5 complete or as soon as weather permits, conduct an inspection and evaluation of the reclamation work
6 involved. In the evaluation, the department shall consider, among other things, the degree of difficulty in
7 completing any remaining reclamation, whether pollution of surface and subsurface water is occurring, the
8 probability of continuance or future occurrence of the pollution, and the estimated cost of abating the pollution.
9 Other information or methods acceptable to the department, including predictive modeling, may be used in
10 conjunction with monitoring data for the purposes of the evaluation and to demonstrate compliance with the
11 approved reclamation plan.
12 (i) The department shall review each administratively complete application to determine the
13 acceptability of the application. A complete application is acceptable if the application is in compliance with all
14 of the applicable requirements of this part, the rules adopted under this part, and the permit. Other information
15 or methods acceptable to the department, including predictive modeling, may be used in conjunction with
16 monitoring data for the purposes of determining the acceptability of the application and demonstrating
17 compliance with the approved reclamation plan.
18 (j) (i) The department shall notify the applicant in writing regarding the acceptability of the
19 application no later than 60 days from the date of the inspection.
20 (ii) If the department determines that the application is not acceptable, it shall specify in the notice

2 (B) a material increase in the acreage for which a bond release is sought or the amount of bond
3 release sought; or
4 (C) a material change in the reclamation for which a bond release is sought or the information used
5 to evaluate the results of that reclamation.
6 (k) At the request of the permittee, and for a designated area within the permit boundary within or
7 across affected drainage basins, the department shall release the bond in whole or in part if the reclamation
8 covered by the bond or portion of the bond has been accomplished as required by this part according to the
9 following schedule:
10 (i) When the permittee completes the plugging, backfilling, regrading, and drainage control of a
11 bonded area in accordance with the approved reclamation plan, the department shall release 60% of the bond
12 or collateral for the designated area within the permit boundary.
13 (ii) The department shall release a portion of the bond for the designated area that would be
14 sufficient for a third party to cover the cost of replacing soil after revegetation and soil stability have been
15 established in the designated area in accordance with the approved reclamation plan. Whenever a silt dam is to
16 be retained as a permanent impoundment, that portion of the bond may also be released under this subsection
17 (6)(k)(ii) if provisions for sound future maintenance by the operator or the landowner are made with the
18 department. Other information or methods acceptable to the department, including predictive modeling, may be
19 used in conjunction with monitoring data for the purposes of determining soil replacement costs or silt dam
20 maintenance and demonstrating compliance with the approved reclamation plan.
21 (iii) Except as provided in subsection (6)(k)(iv), in accordance with the requirements of 82-4-235,
22 upon expiration of the period specified for responsibility, and after the designated area has been successfully
23 revegetated, the remaining total of the bond required for a third party to establish vegetation must be released
24 for the designated area.
25 (iv) The department shall retain a portion of the bond sufficient for a third party to fully satisfy
26 remaining permit conditions if:
27 (A) the disturbed areas eligible for release are contributing suspended solids to streamflow or
28 runoff outside of the affected drainage basin or permit boundary in excess of the requirements of 82-4-

69th Legislature 2025 LC 2309
1 231(10)(k), as demonstrated by either sediment sampling or predictive modeling as approved by the
2 department;
3 (B) soil productivity for prime farmlands eligible for release is not returned to equivalent levels of
4 yield as nonmined land of the same soil type in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices,
5 as determined from the soil survey; or
6 (C) the permittee has not successfully completed all reclamation activities, including water
7 replacement, in the designated area.
8 (v) On request by the permittee, the department shall release all final bonds when, in accordance
9 with the requirements of this chapter, the permittee successfully completes all prospecting, mining, and
10 reclamation activities within the designated area.
11 (l) If the department disapproves the application for release of the bond or a portion of the bond, it
12 shall:
13 (i) provide to the permittee detailed written findings demonstrating that the reclamation covered by
14 the bond or a portion of the bond has not been accomplished as required by this part; and
15 (ii) recommend corrective actions necessary to secure the release and allowing opportunity for a
16 public hearing.
17 (m) When an application for total or partial bond release is filed with the department, it shall notify
18 the municipality or county in which a prospecting or mining operation is located by certified mail at least 30 days
19 prior to the release of all or a portion of the bond.
20 (7) All disturbed areas must be reclaimed in a timely manner to conditions that are capable of
21 supporting the land uses that they were capable of supporting prior to any mining or to higher or better uses as
22 approved pursuant to subsection (8).
23 (8) (a) An operator may propose a higher or better use as an alternative postmining land use. If the
24 landowner is not the operator, the operator shall submit written documentation of the concurrence of the
25 landowner or the land management agency with jurisdiction over the land. The department may approve the
26 proposed alternative postmining land use only if it meets all of the following criteria:
27 (i) There is a reasonable likelihood for achievement of the alternative land use.
28 (ii) The alternative land use does not present any actual or probable hazard to the public health or
- 7 - LC 2309
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2309
1 safety or any threat of water diminution or pollution.
2 (iii) The alternative land use will not:
3 (A) be impractical or unreasonable;
4 (B) be inconsistent with applicable land use policies or plans;
5 (C) involve unreasonable delay in implementation; or
6 (D) cause or contribute to violation of federal, state, or local law.
7 (b) As used in this section, the term "landowner" includes a person who has sold the surface
8 estate to the operator with an option to repurchase the surface estate after mining and reclamation are
9 complete.
10 (9) The reclamation plan must incorporate appropriate wildlife habitat enhancement features that
11 are integrated with cropland, grazing land, pastureland, land occasionally cut for hay, or other uses in order to
12 enhance habitat diversity, with emphasis on big game animals, game birds, and threatened and endangered
13 species that have been documented to live in the area of land affected, and to enhance wetlands and riparian
14 areas along rivers and streams and bordering ponds and lakes. Incorporation of wildlife habitat enhancement
15 features does not constitute a change in land use to fish and wildlife habitat and may not interfere with the
16 designated land use.
17 (10) Facilities existing prior to mining, including but not limited to public roads, utility lines, railroads,
18 or pipelines, may be replaced as part of the reclamation plan."

1 release sought; or
2 (iii) a material change in the reclamation for which a bond release is sought or the information used
3 to evaluate the results of that reclamation.
4 (h) The department shall, within 30 days of determining that the application is administratively
5 complete or as soon as weather permits, conduct an inspection and evaluation of the reclamation work
6 involved. In the evaluation, the department shall consider, among other things, the degree of difficulty in
7 completing any remaining reclamation, whether pollution of surface and subsurface water is occurring, the
8 probability of continuance or future occurrence of the pollution, and the estimated cost of abating the pollution.
9 Other information or methods acceptable to the department, including predictive modeling, may be used in
10 conjunction with monitoring data for the purposes of the evaluation and to demonstrate compliance with the
11 approved reclamation plan.
12 (i) The department shall review each administratively complete application to determine the
13 acceptability of the application. A complete application is acceptable if the application is in compliance with all
14 of the applicable requirements of this part, the rules adopted under this part, and the permit. Other information
15 or methods acceptable to the department, including predictive modeling, may be used in conjunction with
16 monitoring data for the purposes of determining the acceptability of the application and demonstrating
17 compliance with the approved reclamation plan.
18 (j) (i) The department shall notify the applicant in writing regarding the acceptability of the
19 application no later than 60 days from the date of the inspection.
20 (ii) If the department determines that the application is not acceptable, it shall specify in the notice
21 those items that the application must address.
22 (iii) If the applicant revises the application in response to a notice of unacceptability, the
23 department shall review the revised application and notify the applicant in writing within 60 days of the date of
24 receipt as to whether the revised application is acceptable.
25 (iv) If the revision constitutes a significant modification, the department shall conduct a new review,
26 beginning with an administrative completeness determination.
27 (v) A significant modification includes but is not limited to:
28 (A) the notification of an additional property owner, local governmental body, planning agency, or

1 sewage and water treatment authority of the permittee's intention to seek a bond release;
2 (B) a material increase in the acreage for which a bond release is sought or the amount of bond
3 release sought; or
4 (C) a material change in the reclamation for which a bond release is sought or the information used
5 to evaluate the results of that reclamation.
6 (k) At the request of the permittee, and for a designated area within the permit boundary within or
7 across affected drainage basins, the department shall release the bond in whole or in part if the reclamation
8 covered by the bond or portion of the bond has been accomplished as required by this part according to the
9 following schedule:
10 (i) When the permittee completes the plugging, backfilling, regrading, and drainage control of a
11 bonded area in accordance with the approved reclamation plan, the department shall release 60% of the bond
12 or collateral for the designated area within the permit boundary.
13 (ii) The department shall release a portion of the bond for the designated area that would be
14 sufficient for a third party to cover the cost of replacing soil after revegetation and soil stability have been
15 established in the designated area in accordance with the approved reclamation plan. Whenever a silt dam is to
16 be retained as a permanent impoundment, that portion of the bond may also be released under this subsection
17 (6)(k)(ii) if provisions for sound future maintenance by the operator or the landowner are made with the
18 department. Other information or methods acceptable to the department, including predictive modeling, may be
19 used in conjunction with monitoring data for the purposes of determining soil replacement costs or silt dam
20 maintenance and demonstrating compliance with the approved reclamation plan.
21 (iii) Except as provided in subsection (6)(k)(iv), in accordance with the requirements of 82-4-235,
22 upon expiration of the period specified for responsibility, and after the designated area has been successfully
23 revegetated, the remaining total of the bond required for a third party to establish vegetation must be released
24 for the designated area.
25 (iv) The department shall retain a portion of the bond sufficient for a third party to fully satisfy
26 remaining permit conditions if:
27 (A) the disturbed areas eligible for release are contributing suspended solids to streamflow or
28 runoff outside of the affected drainage basin or permit boundary in excess of the requirements of 82-4-

1 231(10)(k), as demonstrated by either sediment sampling or predictive modeling as approved by the
2 department;
3 (B) soil productivity for prime farmlands eligible for release is not returned to equivalent levels of
4 yield as nonmined land of the same soil type in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices,
5 as determined from the soil survey; or
6 (C) the permittee has not successfully completed all reclamation activities, including water
7 replacement, in the designated area.
8 (v) On request by the permittee, the department shall release all final bonds when, in accordance
9 with the requirements of this chapter, the permittee successfully completes all prospecting, mining, and
10 reclamation activities within the designated area.
11 (l) If the department disapproves the application for release of the bond or a portion of the bond, it
12 shall:
13 (i) provide to the permittee detailed written findings demonstrating that the reclamation covered by
14 the bond or a portion of the bond has not been accomplished as required by this part; and
15 (ii) recommend corrective actions necessary to secure the release and allowing opportunity for a
16 public hearing.
17 (m) When an application for total or partial bond release is filed with the department, it shall notify
18 the municipality or county in which a prospecting or mining operation is located by certified mail at least 30 days
19 prior to the release of all or a portion of the bond.
20 (7) All disturbed areas must be reclaimed in a timely manner to conditions that are capable of
21 supporting the land uses that they were capable of supporting prior to any mining or to higher or better uses as
22 approved pursuant to subsection (8).
23 (8) (a) An operator may propose a higher or better use as an alternative postmining land use. If the
24 landowner is not the operator, the operator shall submit written documentation of the concurrence of the
25 landowner or the land management agency with jurisdiction over the land. The department may approve the
26 proposed alternative postmining land use only if it meets all of the following criteria:
27 (i) There is a reasonable likelihood for achievement of the alternative land use.
28 (ii) The alternative land use does not present any actual or probable hazard to the public health or
- 7 - LC 2309

1 safety or any threat of water diminution or pollution.
2 (iii) The alternative land use will not:
3 (A) be impractical or unreasonable;
4 (B) be inconsistent with applicable land use policies or plans;
5 (C) involve unreasonable delay in implementation; or
6 (D) cause or contribute to violation of federal, state, or local law.
7 (b) As used in this section, the term "landowner" includes a person who has sold the surface
8 estate to the operator with an option to repurchase the surface estate after mining and reclamation are
9 complete.
10 (9) The reclamation plan must incorporate appropriate wildlife habitat enhancement features that
11 are integrated with cropland, grazing land, pastureland, land occasionally cut for hay, or other uses in order to
12 enhance habitat diversity, with emphasis on big game animals, game birds, and threatened and endangered
13 species that have been documented to live in the area of land affected, and to enhance wetlands and riparian
14 areas along rivers and streams and bordering ponds and lakes. Incorporation of wildlife habitat enhancement
15 features does not constitute a change in land use to fish and wildlife habitat and may not interfere with the
16 designated land use.
17 (10) Facilities existing prior to mining, including but not limited to public roads, utility lines, railroads,
18 or pipelines, may be replaced as part of the reclamation plan."
