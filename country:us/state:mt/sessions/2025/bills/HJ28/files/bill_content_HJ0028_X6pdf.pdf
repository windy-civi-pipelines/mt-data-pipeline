69th Legislature HJ 28
A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY TO IDENTIFY AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO FEDERAL
GRANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE OF MONTANA, TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS, AND LOCAL
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES; AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED
TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, although many state agencies have successfully secured significant federal grant funding,
feedback from constituents indicates that many grant opportunities remain unused; and
WHEREAS, local government entities, especially in small communities and tribal and rural areas of the
state, lack the capacity to identify and pursue grant funding; and
WHEREAS, a concerted state approach to identifying and securing federal grants may yield significant
revenue opportunities for public needs and potentially reduce the proportion of state tax revenue dedicated to
those needs, allowing investment of revenue into other areas.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee, pursuant to
section 5-5-217, MCA, to:
(1) identify federal grant funding opportunities that have been available to state, tribal, and local
government entities since 2020;
(2) identify which of the federal grant funding opportunities pursuant to subsection (1) that state,
tribal, and local government entities currently utilize;
(3) identify federal grant funding opportunities pursuant to subsection (1) that are either unutilized

or underutilized;
(4) evaluate why certain federal grant funding opportunities pursuant to subsection (1) are
consistently and successfully utilized and why others are not;
(5) investigate the existence of any disparities that may be faced by small, tribal, and rural
government entities when seeking to identify and secure federal grant funding opportunities pursuant to
subsection (1) compared to the state's larger and more urban entities; and
(6) recommend strategies and resources that may enhance federal grant acquisition at the state,
tribal, and local levels, including addressing any disparities between all levels of state government.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the interim committee work with stakeholders, including executive
agencies, tribal governments, local government representatives, and federal government representatives to
offer input and proposals.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the study is assigned to staff, any findings or conclusions be
presented to and reviewed by an appropriate committee designated by the Legislative Council.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all aspects of the study, including presentation and review
requirements, be concluded prior to September 15, 2026.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the final results of the study, including any findings, conclusions,
comments, or recommendations of the appropriate committee, be reported to the 70th Legislature.
