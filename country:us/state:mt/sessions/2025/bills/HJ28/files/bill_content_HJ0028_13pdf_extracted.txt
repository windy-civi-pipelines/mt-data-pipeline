69th Legislature HJ 28.1
1 HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 28
3 PARRY, M. ROMANO, P. TUSS, E. BUTTREY, S. FYANT, J. SECKINGER
4
5 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
6 MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY TO IDENTIFY AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO FEDERAL
7 GRANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE OF MONTANA, TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS, AND LOCAL
8 GOVERNMENT ENTITIES; AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED
9 TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
10
11 WHEREAS, although many state agencies have successfully secured significant federal grant funding,
12 feedback from constituents indicates that many grant opportunities remain unused; and
13 WHEREAS, local government entities, especially in small communities and tribal and rural areas of the
14 state, lack the capacity to identify and pursue grant funding; and
15 WHEREAS, a concerted state approach to identifying and securing federal grants may yield significant
16 revenue opportunities for public needs and potentially reduce the proportion of state tax revenue dedicated to
17 those needs, allowing investment of revenue into other areas.
