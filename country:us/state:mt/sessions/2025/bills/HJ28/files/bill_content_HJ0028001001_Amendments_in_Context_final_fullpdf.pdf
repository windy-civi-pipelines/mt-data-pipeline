5 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
6 MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY TO IDENTIFY AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO FEDERAL
7 GRANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STATE OF MONTANA, TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS, AND LOCAL
8 GOVERNMENT ENTITIES; AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED
9 TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
10
11 WHEREAS, although many state agencies have successfully secured significant federal grant funding,
12 feedback from constituents indicates that many grant opportunities remain unused; and
13 WHEREAS, local government entities, especially in small communities and tribal and rural areas of the
14 state, lack the capacity to identify and pursue grant funding; and
15 WHEREAS, the federal government has repeatedly failed to appropriate full payments for property
16 taxes and payments in lieu of taxes for many federally owned lands, causing state governments to face a
17 shortage of needed and owed funds; and
18 WHEREAS, the federal government has reduced current payments for the Secure Rural Schools
19 program, resulting in a shortage of local government funding that will further cause property taxes to increase;
20 and
21 WHEREAS, with the deficit of funds that are lawfully owed to Montana, tribal and local governments are
22 forced to seek other funding sources from the federal government; and
23 WHEREAS, a concerted state approach to identifying and securing federal grants may yield significant
24 revenue opportunities for public needs and potentially reduce the proportion of state tax revenue dedicated to
25 those needs, allowing investment of revenue into other areas.
26
27 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
28 THE STATE OF MONTANA:

Technology & Federal Relations
69th Legislature Drafter: Matthew Weaver, HJ0028.001.001
1 That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee, pursuant to
2 section 5-5-217, MCA, to:
3 (1) identify federal grant funding opportunities that have been available to state, tribal, and local
4 government entities since 2020;
5 (2) identify which of the federal grant funding opportunities pursuant to subsection (1) that state,
6 tribal, and local government entities currently utilize;
7 (3) identify federal grant funding opportunities pursuant to subsection (1) that are either unutilized
8 or underutilized;
9 (4) evaluate why certain federal grant funding opportunities pursuant to subsection (1) are
10 consistently and successfully utilized and why others are not;
11 (5) investigate the existence of any disparities that may be faced by small, tribal, and rural
12 government entities when seeking to identify and secure federal grant funding opportunities pursuant to
13 subsection (1) compared to the state's larger and more urban entities; and
14 (6) recommend strategies and resources that may enhance federal grant acquisition at the state,
15 tribal, and local levels, including addressing any disparities between all levels of state government.
16 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the interim committee work with stakeholders, including executive
17 agencies, tribal governments, local government representatives, and federal government representatives to
18 offer input and proposals.
19 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the study is assigned to staff, any findings or conclusions be
20 presented to and reviewed by an appropriate committee designated by the Legislative Council.

22 requirements, be concluded prior to September 15, 2026.
