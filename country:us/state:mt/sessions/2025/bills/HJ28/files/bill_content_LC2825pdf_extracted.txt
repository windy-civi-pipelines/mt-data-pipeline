10 WHEREAS, although many state agencies have successfully secured significant federal grant funding,
11 feedback from constituents indicates that many grant opportunities remain unused; and
12 WHEREAS, local government entities, especially in small communities and tribal and rural areas of the
13 state, lack the capacity to identify and pursue grant funding; and
14 WHEREAS, a concerted state approach to identifying and securing federal grants may yield significant
