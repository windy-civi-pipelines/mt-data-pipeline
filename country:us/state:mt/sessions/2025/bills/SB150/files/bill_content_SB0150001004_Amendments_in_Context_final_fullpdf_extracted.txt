4 (b) "Enclosed public place" has the same meaning as provided in 50-40-103.

10 Section 2. Section 39-71-105, MCA, is amended to read:
11 "39-71-105. (Temporary) Declaration of public policy. For the purposes of interpreting and
12 applying this chapter, the following is the public policy of this state:
13 (1) An objective of the Montana workers' compensation system is to provide, without regard to
14 fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss
15 benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to provide assistance to a worker at
16 a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable
17 relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.
18 (2) It is the intent of the legislature to assert that a conclusive presumption exists that recognizes
19 that a holder of a current, valid independent contractor exemption certificate issued by the department is an
20 independent contractor if the person is working under the independent contractor exemption certificate. The
21 holder of an independent contractor exemption certificate waives the rights, benefits, and obligations of this
22 chapter unless the person has elected to be bound personally and individually by the provisions of
23 compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.
24 (3) A worker's removal from the workforce because of a work-related injury or disease has a
25 negative impact on the worker, the worker's family, the employer, and the general public. Therefore, an
26 objective of the workers' compensation system is to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the
27 worker has suffered a work-related injury or disease.

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Jameson Walker, SB0150.001.004
1 (4) Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease insurance systems are intended to
2 be primarily self-administering. Claimants should be able to speedily obtain benefits, and employers should be
3 able to provide coverage at reasonably constant rates. To meet these objectives, the system must be designed
4 to minimize reliance upon lawyers and the courts to obtain benefits and interpret liabilities.
5 (5) This chapter must be construed according to its terms and not liberally in favor of any party.
6 (6) It is the intent of the legislature that:
7 (a) a stress claim, often referred to as a "mental-mental claim" or a "mental-physical claim", is not
8 compensable under Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease laws. The legislature
9 recognizes that these claims are difficult to objectively verify and that the claims have a potential to place an
10 economic burden on the workers' compensation and occupational disease system. The legislature also
11 recognizes that there are other states that do not provide compensation for various categories of stress claims
12 and that stress claims have presented economic problems for certain other jurisdictions. In addition, not all
13 injuries are compensable under the present system, and it is within the legislature's authority to define the limits
14 of the workers' compensation and occupational disease system. However, it is also within the legislature's
15 authority to recognize the public service provided by firefighters and by employees of cigar bars under [section
16 1] and to join with other states that have extended a presumptive occupational disease recognition to
17 firefighters.
18 (b) for occupational disease or presumptive occupational disease claims, because of the nature of
19 exposure, workers should not be required to provide notice to employers of the disease as required of injuries
20 and that the requirements for filing of claims reflect consideration of when the worker knew or should have
21 known that the worker's condition resulted from an occupational disease or a presumptive occupational
22 disease. The legislature recognizes that occupational diseases in the workplace are caused by events
23 occurring on more than a single day or work shift and that the legislature has the authority to define an
24 occupational disease or a presumptive occupational disease and establish the causal connection to the
25 workplace. (Void on occurrence of contingency--sec. 7, Ch. 158, L. 2019.)
26 39-71-105. (Effective on occurrence of contingency) Declaration of public policy. For the
27 purposes of interpreting and applying this chapter, the following is the public policy of this state:

1 (1) An objective of the Montana workers' compensation system is to provide, without regard to
2 fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss
3 benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to provide assistance to a worker at
4 a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable
5 relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.
6 (2) It is the intent of the legislature to assert that a conclusive presumption exists that recognizes
7 that a holder of a current, valid independent contractor exemption certificate issued by the department is an
8 independent contractor if the person is working under the independent contractor exemption certificate. The
9 holder of an independent contractor exemption certificate waives the rights, benefits, and obligations of this
10 chapter unless the person has elected to be bound personally and individually by the provisions of
11 compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.
12 (3) A worker's removal from the workforce because of a work-related injury or disease has a
13 negative impact on the worker, the worker's family, the employer, and the general public. Therefore, an
14 objective of the workers' compensation system is to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the
15 worker has suffered a work-related injury or disease.
16 (4) Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease insurance systems are intended to
17 be primarily self-administering. Claimants should be able to speedily obtain benefits, and employers should be
18 able to provide coverage at reasonably constant rates. To meet these objectives, the system must be designed
19 to minimize reliance upon lawyers and the courts to obtain benefits and interpret liabilities.
20 (5) This chapter must be construed according to its terms and not liberally in favor of any party.
21 (6) It is the intent of the legislature that:
22 (a) stress claims, often referred to as "mental-mental claims" and "mental-physical claims", are not
23 compensable under Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease laws. The legislature
24 recognizes that these claims are difficult to objectively verify and that the claims have a potential to place an
25 economic burden on the workers' compensation and occupational disease system. The legislature also
26 recognizes that there are other states that do not provide compensation for various categories of stress claims

1 injuries are compensable under the present system, and it is within the legislature's authority to define the limits
2 of the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
3 (b) for occupational disease claims, because of the nature of exposure, workers should not be
4 required to provide notice to employers of the disease as required of injuries and that the requirements for filing
5 of claims reflect consideration of when the worker knew or should have known that the worker's condition
6 resulted from an occupational disease. The legislature recognizes that occupational diseases in the workplace
7 are caused by events occurring on more than a single day or work shift and that it is within the legislature's
8 authority to define an occupational disease and establish the causal connection to the workplace."

10 Section 3. Section 39-71-1401, MCA, is amended to read:
11 "39-71-1401. (Temporary) Presumptive occupational disease for firefighters and cigar bar
12 employees -- rebuttal -- applicability -- definitions. (1) (a) A firefighter or a cigar bar employee for whom

16 the period listed.
17 (b) Coverage under 39-71-1402 and this section is optional for the employer of a firefighter for

20 additionally obtain the presumptive occupational disease coverage, subject to the insurer agreeing to provide
21 presumptive coverage.
22 (2) The following diseases are presumptive occupational diseases proximately caused by
23 firefighting activities or cigar bar employee activities, provided that the evidence of the presumptive
24 occupational disease becomes manifest after the number of years of the firefighter's or cigar bar employee's

26 or cigar bar employee was engaged in firefighting activities or cigar bar employee activities for an employer:

16 employment history under subsection (2), a firefighter's or cigar bar employee's employment history after July 1,
17 2014, may be calculated.
18 (4) The beneficiaries of a firefighter or cigar bar employee who otherwise would be eligible for
19 presumptive occupational disease benefits under this section but who dies prior to filing a claim, as provided in
20 39-71-1402, are eligible for death benefits in the same manner as for a death from an injury, as provided in 39-
21 71-407. The beneficiaries under this subsection are similarly bound by the provisions of exclusive remedy as
22 provided in 39-71-411 and subject to the filing requirements in 39-71-601.
23 (5) (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (5)(c), an insurer is liable for the payment of
24 compensation for presumptive occupational disease benefits under this chapter in the same manner as

27 presumptive occupational disease and the claimant's job history. For myocardial infarction or lung cancer under

2 bar employee activities.
3 (b) (i) An insurer under plan 1, 2, or 3 that disputes a presumptive occupational disease claim has
4 the burden of proof in establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the firefighter is not suffering from a
5 compensable presumptive occupational disease. An insurer that disputes the claim may pay benefits under 39-
6 71-608 or 39-71-615 and may pursue dispute mechanisms established in Title 39, chapter 71, part 24.
7 (ii) An insurer is not liable for the payment of workers' compensation benefits for presumptive
8 occupational disease if the insurer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the firefighter was not

10 have reasonably caused the disease claimed.
11 (c) A total claim payment by an insurer under this section is limited to $5 million for each claim.

13 caused by the firefighter's employment history as a firefighter.

10 Section 2. Section 39-71-105, MCA, is amended to read:
11 "39-71-105. (Temporary) Declaration of public policy. For the purposes of interpreting and
12 applying this chapter, the following is the public policy of this state:
13 (1) An objective of the Montana workers' compensation system is to provide, without regard to
14 fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss
15 benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to provide assistance to a worker at
16 a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable
17 relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.
18 (2) It is the intent of the legislature to assert that a conclusive presumption exists that recognizes
19 that a holder of a current, valid independent contractor exemption certificate issued by the department is an
20 independent contractor if the person is working under the independent contractor exemption certificate. The
21 holder of an independent contractor exemption certificate waives the rights, benefits, and obligations of this
22 chapter unless the person has elected to be bound personally and individually by the provisions of
23 compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.
24 (3) A worker's removal from the workforce because of a work-related injury or disease has a
25 negative impact on the worker, the worker's family, the employer, and the general public. Therefore, an
26 objective of the workers' compensation system is to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the
27 worker has suffered a work-related injury or disease.

and Labor
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Jameson Walker, SB0150.001.004
1 (4) Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease insurance systems are intended to
2 be primarily self-administering. Claimants should be able to speedily obtain benefits, and employers should be
3 able to provide coverage at reasonably constant rates. To meet these objectives, the system must be designed
4 to minimize reliance upon lawyers and the courts to obtain benefits and interpret liabilities.
5 (5) This chapter must be construed according to its terms and not liberally in favor of any party.
6 (6) It is the intent of the legislature that:
7 (a) a stress claim, often referred to as a "mental-mental claim" or a "mental-physical claim", is not
8 compensable under Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease laws. The legislature
9 recognizes that these claims are difficult to objectively verify and that the claims have a potential to place an
10 economic burden on the workers' compensation and occupational disease system. The legislature also
11 recognizes that there are other states that do not provide compensation for various categories of stress claims
12 and that stress claims have presented economic problems for certain other jurisdictions. In addition, not all
13 injuries are compensable under the present system, and it is within the legislature's authority to define the limits
14 of the workers' compensation and occupational disease system. However, it is also within the legislature's
15 authority to recognize the public service provided by firefighters and by employees of cigar bars under [section
16 1] and to join with other states that have extended a presumptive occupational disease recognition to
17 firefighters.
18 (b) for occupational disease or presumptive occupational disease claims, because of the nature of
19 exposure, workers should not be required to provide notice to employers of the disease as required of injuries
20 and that the requirements for filing of claims reflect consideration of when the worker knew or should have
21 known that the worker's condition resulted from an occupational disease or a presumptive occupational
22 disease. The legislature recognizes that occupational diseases in the workplace are caused by events
23 occurring on more than a single day or work shift and that the legislature has the authority to define an
24 occupational disease or a presumptive occupational disease and establish the causal connection to the
25 workplace. (Void on occurrence of contingency--sec. 7, Ch. 158, L. 2019.)

1 injuries are compensable under the present system, and it is within the legislature's authority to define the limits

3 (b) for occupational disease claims, because of the nature of exposure, workers should not be

10 Section 3. Section 39-71-1401, MCA, is amended to read:
11 "39-71-1401. (Temporary) Presumptive occupational disease for firefighters and cigar bar
12 employees -- rebuttal -- applicability -- definitions. (1) (a) A firefighter or a cigar bar employee for whom
13 coverage is required under the Workers' Compensation Act is presumed to have a claim for a presumptive
14 occupational disease under the Workers' Compensation Act if the firefighter or cigar bar employee meets the
15 requirements of 39-71-1402 and is diagnosed with one or more of the diseases listed in subsection (2) within
16 the period listed.
17 (b) Coverage under 39-71-1402 and this section is optional for the employer of a firefighter for
18 whom coverage under the Workers' Compensation Act is voluntary. An employer of a volunteer firefighter under
19 7-33-4109 or 7-33-4510 may elect as part of providing coverage under the Workers' Compensation Act to
20 additionally obtain the presumptive occupational disease coverage, subject to the insurer agreeing to provide
21 presumptive coverage.
22 (2) The following diseases are presumptive occupational diseases proximately caused by
23 firefighting activities or cigar bar employee activities, provided that the evidence of the presumptive
24 occupational disease becomes manifest after the number of years of the firefighter's or cigar bar employee's
25 employment as listed for each occupational disease and within 10 years of the last date on which the firefighter
26 or cigar bar employee was engaged in firefighting activities or cigar bar employee activities for an employer:

14 (n) testicular cancer after 10 years.
15 (3) For purposes of calculating the number of years of a firefighter's or cigar bar employee's
16 employment history under subsection (2), a firefighter's or cigar bar employee's employment history after July 1,
17 2014, may be calculated.
18 (4) The beneficiaries of a firefighter or cigar bar employee who otherwise would be eligible for
19 presumptive occupational disease benefits under this section but who dies prior to filing a claim, as provided in
20 39-71-1402, are eligible for death benefits in the same manner as for a death from an injury, as provided in 39-
21 71-407. The beneficiaries under this subsection are similarly bound by the provisions of exclusive remedy as
22 provided in 39-71-411 and subject to the filing requirements in 39-71-601.
23 (5) (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (5)(c), an insurer is liable for the payment of
24 compensation for presumptive occupational disease benefits under this chapter in the same manner as
25 provided in 39-71-407, including objective medical findings of a disease listed in subsection (2) but excluding
26 the requirement in 39-71-407(10) that the objective medical findings trace a relationship between the
27 presumptive occupational disease and the claimant's job history. For myocardial infarction or lung cancer under

2 bar employee activities.
3 (b) (i) An insurer under plan 1, 2, or 3 that disputes a presumptive occupational disease claim has
4 the burden of proof in establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the firefighter is not suffering from a
5 compensable presumptive occupational disease. An insurer that disputes the claim may pay benefits under 39-
6 71-608 or 39-71-615 and may pursue dispute mechanisms established in Title 39, chapter 71, part 24.
7 (ii) An insurer is not liable for the payment of workers' compensation benefits for presumptive
8 occupational disease if the insurer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the firefighter was not
9 exposed during the course and scope of the firefighter's duties to smoke or particles in a quantity sufficient to
10 have reasonably caused the disease claimed.
11 (c) A total claim payment by an insurer under this section is limited to $5 million for each claim.
12 (6) This section does not limit an insurer's ability to assert that the occupational disease was not
13 caused by the firefighter's employment history as a firefighter.
14 (7) A firefighter or the firefighter's beneficiaries may pursue the dispute remedies as provided in
15 Title 39, chapter 71, part 24, if an insurer disputes a claim.

18 services", and "treating physician" and when used in 39-71-107, 39-71-307, 39-71-412, 39-71-503, 39-71-601,
