18 (2) If the federal carryover was not the same as the Montana carryover on December 31, 2023:
19 (a) the difference is a positive adjustment to the taxpayer's Montana taxable income if the Montana
20 carryover was smaller than the federal carryover; and
21 (b) the difference is a negative adjustment to the taxpayer's Montana taxable income if the
22 Montana carryover was larger than the federal carryover.

28 the election must apply the entire carryforward or carryback toward tax year 2024 as a carryforward adjustment
