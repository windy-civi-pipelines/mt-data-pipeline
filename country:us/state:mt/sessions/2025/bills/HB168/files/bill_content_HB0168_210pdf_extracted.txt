12
13 Section 2. Section 20-9-311, MCA, is amended to read:
14 "20-9-311. Calculation of average number belonging (ANB) -- 3-year averaging. (1) Average
15 number belonging (ANB) must be computed for each budget unit as follows:
16 (a) compute an average enrollment by adding a count of regularly enrolled pupils who were
17 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
18 the first Monday in February of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if those dates do not fall on a
19 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
20 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
21 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
22 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-
23 related days may be included in the calculation.
24 (3) When a school district has approval to operate less than the minimum aggregate hours under
25 20-9-806, the total ANB must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of 20-9-805.
26 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), for the purpose of calculating ANB, enrollment in
27 an education program:
28 (i) from 180 to 359 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as one-quarter-

69th Legislature 2025 HB0168.2
1 time enrollment;
2 (ii) from 360 to 539 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as half-time
3 enrollment;
4 (iii) from 540 to 719 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as three-
5 quarter-time enrollment; and
6 (iv) 720 or more aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as full-time
7 enrollment.
8 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), enrollment in a program intended to provide fewer than
9 180 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year may not be included for purposes of ANB.
10 (c) Enrollment in a self-paced program or course may be converted to an hourly equivalent based
11 on the hours necessary and appropriate to provide the course within a regular classroom schedule.
12 (d) A school district may include in its calculation of ANB a pupil who is enrolled in a program
13 providing fewer than the required aggregate hours of pupil instruction required under subsection (4)(a) or (4)(b)
14 if the pupil has demonstrated proficiency in the content ordinarily covered by the instruction as determined by
15 the school board using district assessments. The ANB of a pupil under this subsection (4)(d) must be converted
16 to an hourly equivalent based on the hours of instruction ordinarily provided for the content over which the
17 student has demonstrated proficiency.
18 (e) (i) Except as provided in subsection (4)(e)(ii), a pupil in kindergarten through grade 12 who is
19 concurrently enrolled in more than one public school, program, or district may not be counted as more than one

21 enrollment under subsection (4)(a) must be attributed first to a pupil's nonresident district.
22 (ii) A pupil who participates in a jumpstart program under Title 20, chapter 7, part 18, may be
23 counted as up to 1 1/4 enrollment for ANB purposes. A district shall add one-quarter enrollment for a pupil who
24 participated in an early literacy jumpstart program to the pupil's regular enrollment count under this subsection
25 (4) in both the October and February enrollment counts following the student's participation in the jumpstart
26 program.
27 (5) For a district that is transitioning from a half-time to a full-time kindergarten program, the state
28 superintendent shall count kindergarten enrollment in the previous year as full-time enrollment for the purpose
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 168

1 of calculating ANB for the elementary programs offering full-time kindergarten in the current year. For the
2 purposes of calculating the 3-year ANB, the superintendent of public instruction shall count the kindergarten
3 enrollment as one-half enrollment and then add the additional kindergarten ANB to the 3-year average ANB for
4 districts offering full-time kindergarten.
5 (6) When a pupil has been absent, with or without excuse, for more than 10 consecutive school
6 days, the pupil may not be included in the enrollment count used in the calculation of the ANB unless the pupil
7 resumes attendance prior to the day of the enrollment count.

9 trustees as provided in 20-7-117, may not be included in the ANB calculations.

20 for individuals with developmental disabilities due to the significance of the student's disability; and
21 (iii) the student's individualized education program has identified transition goals that focus on

17 (iv) two or more districts consolidate or annex under the provisions of 20-6-422 or 20-6-423, the
18 ANB and the basic entitlements of the component districts must be calculated separately for a period of 3 years

13 Section 2. Section 20-9-311, MCA, is amended to read:
14 "20-9-311. Calculation of average number belonging (ANB) -- 3-year averaging. (1) Average
15 number belonging (ANB) must be computed for each budget unit as follows:
16 (a) compute an average enrollment by adding a count of regularly enrolled pupils who were
17 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
18 the first Monday in February of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if those dates do not fall on a
19 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
20 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
21 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
22 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-
23 related days may be included in the calculation.
24 (3) When a school district has approval to operate less than the minimum aggregate hours under
25 20-9-806, the total ANB must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of 20-9-805.
26 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), for the purpose of calculating ANB, enrollment in
27 an education program:

7 enrollment.
8 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), enrollment in a program intended to provide fewer than
9 180 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year may not be included for purposes of ANB.
10 (c) Enrollment in a self-paced program or course may be converted to an hourly equivalent based
11 on the hours necessary and appropriate to provide the course within a regular classroom schedule.
12 (d) A school district may include in its calculation of ANB a pupil who is enrolled in a program
13 providing fewer than the required aggregate hours of pupil instruction required under subsection (4)(a) or (4)(b)
14 if the pupil has demonstrated proficiency in the content ordinarily covered by the instruction as determined by
15 the school board using district assessments. The ANB of a pupil under this subsection (4)(d) must be converted
16 to an hourly equivalent based on the hours of instruction ordinarily provided for the content over which the
17 student has demonstrated proficiency.
18 (e) (i) Except as provided in subsection (4)(e)(ii), a pupil in kindergarten through grade 12 who is
19 concurrently enrolled in more than one public school, program, or district may not be counted as more than one

21 enrollment under subsection (4)(a) must be attributed first to a pupil's nonresident district.
22 (ii) A pupil who participates in a jumpstart program under Title 20, chapter 7, part 18, may be
23 counted as up to 1 1/4 enrollment for ANB purposes. A district shall add one-quarter enrollment for a pupil who
24 participated in an early literacy jumpstart program to the pupil's regular enrollment count under this subsection
25 (4) in both the October and February enrollment counts following the student's participation in the jumpstart
26 program.
27 (5) For a district that is transitioning from a half-time to a full-time kindergarten program, the state

4 districts offering full-time kindergarten.
5 (6) When a pupil has been absent, with or without excuse, for more than 10 consecutive school
6 days, the pupil may not be included in the enrollment count used in the calculation of the ANB unless the pupil
7 resumes attendance prior to the day of the enrollment count.
