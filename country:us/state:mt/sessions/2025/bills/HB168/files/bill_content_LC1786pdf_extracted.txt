23 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
24 the first Monday in February of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if those dates do not fall on a
25 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
26 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
