69th Legislature 2025 SB0394.3
1 Section 2. Section 39-71-105, MCA, is amended to read:
2 "39-71-105. (Temporary) Declaration of public policy. For the purposes of interpreting and
3 applying this chapter, the following is the public policy of this state:
4 (1) An objective of the Montana workers' compensation system is to provide, without regard to
5 fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss
6 benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to provide assistance to a worker at
7 a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable
8 relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.
9 (2) It is the intent of the legislature to assert that a conclusive presumption exists that recognizes
10 that a holder of a current, valid independent contractor exemption certificate issued by the department is an
11 independent contractor if the person is working under the independent contractor exemption certificate. The
12 holder of an independent contractor exemption certificate waives the rights, benefits, and obligations of this
13 chapter unless the person has elected to be bound personally and individually by the provisions of
14 compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.
15 (3) A worker's removal from the workforce because of a work-related injury or disease has a
16 negative impact on the worker, the worker's family, the employer, and the general public. Therefore, an
17 objective of the workers' compensation system is to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the
18 worker has suffered a work-related injury or disease.
19 (4) Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease insurance systems are intended to
20 be primarily self-administering. Claimants should be able to speedily obtain benefits, and employers should be
21 able to provide coverage at reasonably constant rates. To meet these objectives, the system must be designed
22 to minimize reliance upon lawyers and the courts to obtain benefits and interpret liabilities.
23 (5) This chapter must be construed according to its terms and not liberally in favor of any party.
24 (6) It is the intent of the legislature that:
25 (a) except as provided in [section 1], a stress claim, often referred to as a "mental-mental claim" or
26 a "mental-physical claim", is not compensable under Montana's workers' compensation and occupational
27 disease laws. The legislature recognizes that these claims are difficult to objectively verify and that the claims
28 have a potential to place an economic burden on the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – SB 394
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0394.3
1 The legislature also recognizes that there are other states that do not provide compensation for various
2 categories of stress claims and that stress claims have presented economic problems for certain other
3 jurisdictions. In addition, not all injuries are compensable under the present system, and it is within the
4 legislature's authority to define the limits of the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
5 However, it is also within the legislature's authority to recognize the public service provided by firefighters and
6 to join with other states that have extended a presumptive occupational disease recognition to firefighters.
7 (b) for occupational disease or presumptive occupational disease claims, because of the nature of
8 exposure, workers should not be required to provide notice to employers of the disease as required of injuries
9 and that the requirements for filing of claims reflect consideration of when the worker knew or should have
10 known that the worker's condition resulted from an occupational disease or a presumptive occupational
11 disease. The legislature recognizes that occupational diseases in the workplace are caused by events
12 occurring on more than a single day or work shift and that the legislature has the authority to define an
13 occupational disease or a presumptive occupational disease and establish the causal connection to the
14 workplace. (Void on occurrence of contingency--sec. 7, Ch. 158, L. 2019.)
15 39-71-105. (Effective on occurrence of contingency) Declaration of public policy. For the
16 purposes of interpreting and applying this chapter, the following is the public policy of this state:
17 (1) An objective of the Montana workers' compensation system is to provide, without regard to
18 fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss
19 benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to provide assistance to a worker at
20 a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable
21 relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.
22 (2) It is the intent of the legislature to assert that a conclusive presumption exists that recognizes
23 that a holder of a current, valid independent contractor exemption certificate issued by the department is an
24 independent contractor if the person is working under the independent contractor exemption certificate. The
25 holder of an independent contractor exemption certificate waives the rights, benefits, and obligations of this
26 chapter unless the person has elected to be bound personally and individually by the provisions of
27 compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.
28 (3) A worker's removal from the workforce because of a work-related injury or disease has a
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 394
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0394.3
1 negative impact on the worker, the worker's family, the employer, and the general public. Therefore, an
2 objective of the workers' compensation system is to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the
3 worker has suffered a work-related injury or disease.
4 (4) Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease insurance systems are intended to
5 be primarily self-administering. Claimants should be able to speedily obtain benefits, and employers should be
6 able to provide coverage at reasonably constant rates. To meet these objectives, the system must be designed
7 to minimize reliance upon lawyers and the courts to obtain benefits and interpret liabilities.
8 (5) This chapter must be construed according to its terms and not liberally in favor of any party.
9 (6) It is the intent of the legislature that:
10 (a) except as provided in [section 1], stress claims, often referred to as "mental-mental claims" and
11 "mental-physical claims", are not compensable under Montana's workers' compensation and occupational
12 disease laws. The legislature recognizes that these claims are difficult to objectively verify and that the claims
13 have a potential to place an economic burden on the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
14 The legislature also recognizes that there are other states that do not provide compensation for various
15 categories of stress claims and that stress claims have presented economic problems for certain other
16 jurisdictions. In addition, not all injuries are compensable under the present system, and it is within the
17 legislature's authority to define the limits of the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
18 (b) for occupational disease claims, because of the nature of exposure, workers should not be
19 required to provide notice to employers of the disease as required of injuries and that the requirements for filing
20 of claims reflect consideration of when the worker knew or should have known that the worker's condition
21 resulted from an occupational disease. The legislature recognizes that occupational diseases in the workplace
22 are caused by events occurring on more than a single day or work shift and that it is within the legislature's
23 authority to define an occupational disease and establish the causal connection to the workplace."

69th Legislature 2025 SB0394.3
1 Section 2. Section 39-71-105, MCA, is amended to read:
2 "39-71-105. (Temporary) Declaration of public policy. For the purposes of interpreting and
3 applying this chapter, the following is the public policy of this state:
4 (1) An objective of the Montana workers' compensation system is to provide, without regard to
5 fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss
6 benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to provide assistance to a worker at
7 a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable
8 relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.
9 (2) It is the intent of the legislature to assert that a conclusive presumption exists that recognizes
10 that a holder of a current, valid independent contractor exemption certificate issued by the department is an
11 independent contractor if the person is working under the independent contractor exemption certificate. The
12 holder of an independent contractor exemption certificate waives the rights, benefits, and obligations of this
13 chapter unless the person has elected to be bound personally and individually by the provisions of
14 compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.
15 (3) A worker's removal from the workforce because of a work-related injury or disease has a
16 negative impact on the worker, the worker's family, the employer, and the general public. Therefore, an
17 objective of the workers' compensation system is to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the
18 worker has suffered a work-related injury or disease.
19 (4) Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease insurance systems are intended to
20 be primarily self-administering. Claimants should be able to speedily obtain benefits, and employers should be
21 able to provide coverage at reasonably constant rates. To meet these objectives, the system must be designed
22 to minimize reliance upon lawyers and the courts to obtain benefits and interpret liabilities.
23 (5) This chapter must be construed according to its terms and not liberally in favor of any party.
24 (6) It is the intent of the legislature that:
25 (a) except as provided in [section 1], a stress claim, often referred to as a "mental-mental claim" or
26 a "mental-physical claim", is not compensable under Montana's workers' compensation and occupational
27 disease laws. The legislature recognizes that these claims are difficult to objectively verify and that the claims
28 have a potential to place an economic burden on the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.

69th Legislature 2025 SB0394.3
1 The legislature also recognizes that there are other states that do not provide compensation for various
2 categories of stress claims and that stress claims have presented economic problems for certain other
3 jurisdictions. In addition, not all injuries are compensable under the present system, and it is within the
4 legislature's authority to define the limits of the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
5 However, it is also within the legislature's authority to recognize the public service provided by firefighters and
6 to join with other states that have extended a presumptive occupational disease recognition to firefighters.
7 (b) for occupational disease or presumptive occupational disease claims, because of the nature of
8 exposure, workers should not be required to provide notice to employers of the disease as required of injuries
9 and that the requirements for filing of claims reflect consideration of when the worker knew or should have
10 known that the worker's condition resulted from an occupational disease or a presumptive occupational
11 disease. The legislature recognizes that occupational diseases in the workplace are caused by events
12 occurring on more than a single day or work shift and that the legislature has the authority to define an
13 occupational disease or a presumptive occupational disease and establish the causal connection to the
14 workplace. (Void on occurrence of contingency--sec. 7, Ch. 158, L. 2019.)
15 39-71-105. (Effective on occurrence of contingency) Declaration of public policy. For the
16 purposes of interpreting and applying this chapter, the following is the public policy of this state:
17 (1) An objective of the Montana workers' compensation system is to provide, without regard to
18 fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss
19 benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to provide assistance to a worker at
20 a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable
21 relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.
22 (2) It is the intent of the legislature to assert that a conclusive presumption exists that recognizes
23 that a holder of a current, valid independent contractor exemption certificate issued by the department is an
24 independent contractor if the person is working under the independent contractor exemption certificate. The
25 holder of an independent contractor exemption certificate waives the rights, benefits, and obligations of this
26 chapter unless the person has elected to be bound personally and individually by the provisions of
27 compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.
28 (3) A worker's removal from the workforce because of a work-related injury or disease has a

1 negative impact on the worker, the worker's family, the employer, and the general public. Therefore, an
2 objective of the workers' compensation system is to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the
3 worker has suffered a work-related injury or disease.
4 (4) Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease insurance systems are intended to
5 be primarily self-administering. Claimants should be able to speedily obtain benefits, and employers should be
6 able to provide coverage at reasonably constant rates. To meet these objectives, the system must be designed
7 to minimize reliance upon lawyers and the courts to obtain benefits and interpret liabilities.
8 (5) This chapter must be construed according to its terms and not liberally in favor of any party.
9 (6) It is the intent of the legislature that:
10 (a) except as provided in [section 1], stress claims, often referred to as "mental-mental claims" and
11 "mental-physical claims", are not compensable under Montana's workers' compensation and occupational
12 disease laws. The legislature recognizes that these claims are difficult to objectively verify and that the claims
13 have a potential to place an economic burden on the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
14 The legislature also recognizes that there are other states that do not provide compensation for various
15 categories of stress claims and that stress claims have presented economic problems for certain other
16 jurisdictions. In addition, not all injuries are compensable under the present system, and it is within the
17 legislature's authority to define the limits of the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
18 (b) for occupational disease claims, because of the nature of exposure, workers should not be
19 required to provide notice to employers of the disease as required of injuries and that the requirements for filing
20 of claims reflect consideration of when the worker knew or should have known that the worker's condition
21 resulted from an occupational disease. The legislature recognizes that occupational diseases in the workplace
22 are caused by events occurring on more than a single day or work shift and that it is within the legislature's
23 authority to define an occupational disease and establish the causal connection to the workplace."
