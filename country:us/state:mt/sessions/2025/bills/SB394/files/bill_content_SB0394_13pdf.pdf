10 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
11
12 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Coverage for posttraumatic stress disorder for first responders --
13 definitions. (1) A first responder may have a compensable claim under Montana's workers' compensation and
14 occupational disease laws relating to posttraumatic stress disorder as provided in this section.
15 (2) A first responder must be diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, according to the most
16 recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American
17 psychiatric association. The diagnosis for posttraumatic stress disorder must find that the injury or occupational
18 disease arises out of the course and scope of employment of the first responder.
19 (3) A claim for posttraumatic stress disorder is subject to the provisions of Title 39, chapter 71,
20 unless the context requires otherwise.
21 (4) For the purposes of this section, the term "first responder" means:
22 (a) a firefighter;
23 (b) a law enforcement officer;
24 (c) an employee of a county detention center or prison; or

69th Legislature 2025 SB 394.1
1 applying this chapter, the following is the public policy of this state:
2 (1) An objective of the Montana workers' compensation system is to provide, without regard to
3 fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss
4 benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to provide assistance to a worker at
5 a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable
6 relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.
7 (2) It is the intent of the legislature to assert that a conclusive presumption exists that recognizes
8 that a holder of a current, valid independent contractor exemption certificate issued by the department is an
9 independent contractor if the person is working under the independent contractor exemption certificate. The
10 holder of an independent contractor exemption certificate waives the rights, benefits, and obligations of this
11 chapter unless the person has elected to be bound personally and individually by the provisions of
12 compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.
13 (3) A worker's removal from the workforce because of a work-related injury or disease has a
14 negative impact on the worker, the worker's family, the employer, and the general public. Therefore, an
15 objective of the workers' compensation system is to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the
16 worker has suffered a work-related injury or disease.
17 (4) Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease insurance systems are intended to
18 be primarily self-administering. Claimants should be able to speedily obtain benefits, and employers should be
19 able to provide coverage at reasonably constant rates. To meet these objectives, the system must be designed
20 to minimize reliance upon lawyers and the courts to obtain benefits and interpret liabilities.
21 (5) This chapter must be construed according to its terms and not liberally in favor of any party.
22 (6) It is the intent of the legislature that:
23 (a) except as provided in [section 1], a stress claim, often referred to as a "mental-mental claim" or
24 a "mental-physical claim", is not compensable under Montana's workers' compensation and occupational
25 disease laws. The legislature recognizes that these claims are difficult to objectively verify and that the claims
26 have a potential to place an economic burden on the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
27 The legislature also recognizes that there are other states that do not provide compensation for various
28 categories of stress claims and that stress claims have presented economic problems for certain other

1 jurisdictions. In addition, not all injuries are compensable under the present system, and it is within the
2 legislature's authority to define the limits of the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
3 However, it is also within the legislature's authority to recognize the public service provided by firefighters and
4 to join with other states that have extended a presumptive occupational disease recognition to firefighters.
5 (b) for occupational disease or presumptive occupational disease claims, because of the nature of
6 exposure, workers should not be required to provide notice to employers of the disease as required of injuries
7 and that the requirements for filing of claims reflect consideration of when the worker knew or should have
8 known that the worker's condition resulted from an occupational disease or a presumptive occupational
9 disease. The legislature recognizes that occupational diseases in the workplace are caused by events
10 occurring on more than a single day or work shift and that the legislature has the authority to define an
11 occupational disease or a presumptive occupational disease and establish the causal connection to the
12 workplace. (Void on occurrence of contingency--sec. 7, Ch. 158, L. 2019.)
13 39-71-105. (Effective on occurrence of contingency) Declaration of public policy. For the
14 purposes of interpreting and applying this chapter, the following is the public policy of this state:
15 (1) An objective of the Montana workers' compensation system is to provide, without regard to
16 fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss
17 benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to provide assistance to a worker at
18 a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable
19 relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.
20 (2) It is the intent of the legislature to assert that a conclusive presumption exists that recognizes
21 that a holder of a current, valid independent contractor exemption certificate issued by the department is an
22 independent contractor if the person is working under the independent contractor exemption certificate. The
23 holder of an independent contractor exemption certificate waives the rights, benefits, and obligations of this
24 chapter unless the person has elected to be bound personally and individually by the provisions of
25 compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.
26 (3) A worker's removal from the workforce because of a work-related injury or disease has a
27 negative impact on the worker, the worker's family, the employer, and the general public. Therefore, an
28 objective of the workers' compensation system is to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the

1 worker has suffered a work-related injury or disease.
2 (4) Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease insurance systems are intended to
3 be primarily self-administering. Claimants should be able to speedily obtain benefits, and employers should be
4 able to provide coverage at reasonably constant rates. To meet these objectives, the system must be designed
5 to minimize reliance upon lawyers and the courts to obtain benefits and interpret liabilities.
6 (5) This chapter must be construed according to its terms and not liberally in favor of any party.
7 (6) It is the intent of the legislature that:
8 (a) except as provided in [section 1], stress claims, often referred to as "mental-mental claims" and
9 "mental-physical claims", are not compensable under Montana's workers' compensation and occupational
10 disease laws. The legislature recognizes that these claims are difficult to objectively verify and that the claims
11 have a potential to place an economic burden on the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
12 The legislature also recognizes that there are other states that do not provide compensation for various
13 categories of stress claims and that stress claims have presented economic problems for certain other
14 jurisdictions. In addition, not all injuries are compensable under the present system, and it is within the
15 legislature's authority to define the limits of the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
16 (b) for occupational disease claims, because of the nature of exposure, workers should not be
17 required to provide notice to employers of the disease as required of injuries and that the requirements for filing
18 of claims reflect consideration of when the worker knew or should have known that the worker's condition
19 resulted from an occupational disease. The legislature recognizes that occupational diseases in the workplace
20 are caused by events occurring on more than a single day or work shift and that it is within the legislature's
21 authority to define an occupational disease and establish the causal connection to the workplace."

23 Section 3. Section 39-71-116, MCA, is amended to read:
