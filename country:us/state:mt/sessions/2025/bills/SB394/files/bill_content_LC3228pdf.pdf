5 POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER FOR FIRST RESPONDERS; PROVIDING A DEFINITION;

9 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
10
11 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Coverage for posttraumatic stress disorder for first responders --
12 definitions. (1) A first responder may have a compensable claim under Montana's workers' compensation and
13 occupational disease laws relating to posttraumatic stress disorder as provided in this section.
14 (2) A first responder must be diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, according to the most
15 recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American
16 psychiatric association. The diagnosis for posttraumatic stress disorder must find that the injury or occupational
17 disease arises out of the course and scope of employment of the first responder.
18 (3) A claim for posttraumatic stress disorder is subject to the provisions of Title 39, chapter 71,
19 unless the context requires otherwise.
20 (4) For the purposes of this section, the term "first responder" means:
21 (a) a firefighter;
22 (b) a law enforcement officer;
23 (c) an employee of a county detention center or prison; or
24 (d) any other authorized person who responds to an emergency in a professional capacity.
25
26 Section 2. Section 39-71-105, MCA, is amended to read:
27 "39-71-105. (Temporary) Declaration of public policy. For the purposes of interpreting and
28 applying this chapter, the following is the public policy of this state:
- 1 - LC 3228

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 3228
1 (1) An objective of the Montana workers' compensation system is to provide, without regard to
2 fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss
3 benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to provide assistance to a worker at
4 a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable
5 relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.
6 (2) It is the intent of the legislature to assert that a conclusive presumption exists that recognizes
7 that a holder of a current, valid independent contractor exemption certificate issued by the department is an
8 independent contractor if the person is working under the independent contractor exemption certificate. The
9 holder of an independent contractor exemption certificate waives the rights, benefits, and obligations of this
10 chapter unless the person has elected to be bound personally and individually by the provisions of
11 compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.
12 (3) A worker's removal from the workforce because of a work-related injury or disease has a
13 negative impact on the worker, the worker's family, the employer, and the general public. Therefore, an
14 objective of the workers' compensation system is to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the
15 worker has suffered a work-related injury or disease.
16 (4) Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease insurance systems are intended to
17 be primarily self-administering. Claimants should be able to speedily obtain benefits, and employers should be
18 able to provide coverage at reasonably constant rates. To meet these objectives, the system must be designed
19 to minimize reliance upon lawyers and the courts to obtain benefits and interpret liabilities.
20 (5) This chapter must be construed according to its terms and not liberally in favor of any party.
21 (6) It is the intent of the legislature that:
22 (a) except as provided in [section 1], a stress claim, often referred to as a "mental-mental claim" or
23 a "mental-physical claim", is not compensable under Montana's workers' compensation and occupational
24 disease laws. The legislature recognizes that these claims are difficult to objectively verify and that the claims
25 have a potential to place an economic burden on the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
26 The legislature also recognizes that there are other states that do not provide compensation for various
27 categories of stress claims and that stress claims have presented economic problems for certain other
28 jurisdictions. In addition, not all injuries are compensable under the present system, and it is within the
- 2 - LC 3228

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 3228
1 legislature's authority to define the limits of the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
2 However, it is also within the legislature's authority to recognize the public service provided by firefighters and
3 to join with other states that have extended a presumptive occupational disease recognition to firefighters.
4 (b) for occupational disease or presumptive occupational disease claims, because of the nature of
5 exposure, workers should not be required to provide notice to employers of the disease as required of injuries
6 and that the requirements for filing of claims reflect consideration of when the worker knew or should have
7 known that the worker's condition resulted from an occupational disease or a presumptive occupational
8 disease. The legislature recognizes that occupational diseases in the workplace are caused by events
9 occurring on more than a single day or work shift and that the legislature has the authority to define an
10 occupational disease or a presumptive occupational disease and establish the causal connection to the
11 workplace. (Void on occurrence of contingency--sec. 7, Ch. 158, L. 2019.)
12 39-71-105. (Effective on occurrence of contingency) Declaration of public policy. For the
13 purposes of interpreting and applying this chapter, the following is the public policy of this state:
14 (1) An objective of the Montana workers' compensation system is to provide, without regard to
15 fault, wage-loss and medical benefits to a worker suffering from a work-related injury or disease. Wage-loss
16 benefits are not intended to make an injured worker whole but are intended to provide assistance to a worker at
17 a reasonable cost to the employer. Within that limitation, the wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable
18 relationship to actual wages lost as a result of a work-related injury or disease.
19 (2) It is the intent of the legislature to assert that a conclusive presumption exists that recognizes
20 that a holder of a current, valid independent contractor exemption certificate issued by the department is an
21 independent contractor if the person is working under the independent contractor exemption certificate. The
22 holder of an independent contractor exemption certificate waives the rights, benefits, and obligations of this
23 chapter unless the person has elected to be bound personally and individually by the provisions of
24 compensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.
25 (3) A worker's removal from the workforce because of a work-related injury or disease has a
26 negative impact on the worker, the worker's family, the employer, and the general public. Therefore, an
27 objective of the workers' compensation system is to return a worker to work as soon as possible after the
28 worker has suffered a work-related injury or disease.

1 (4) Montana's workers' compensation and occupational disease insurance systems are intended to
2 be primarily self-administering. Claimants should be able to speedily obtain benefits, and employers should be
3 able to provide coverage at reasonably constant rates. To meet these objectives, the system must be designed
4 to minimize reliance upon lawyers and the courts to obtain benefits and interpret liabilities.
5 (5) This chapter must be construed according to its terms and not liberally in favor of any party.
6 (6) It is the intent of the legislature that:
7 (a) except as provided in [section 1], stress claims, often referred to as "mental-mental claims" and
8 "mental-physical claims", are not compensable under Montana's workers' compensation and occupational
9 disease laws. The legislature recognizes that these claims are difficult to objectively verify and that the claims
10 have a potential to place an economic burden on the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
11 The legislature also recognizes that there are other states that do not provide compensation for various
12 categories of stress claims and that stress claims have presented economic problems for certain other
13 jurisdictions. In addition, not all injuries are compensable under the present system, and it is within the
14 legislature's authority to define the limits of the workers' compensation and occupational disease system.
15 (b) for occupational disease claims, because of the nature of exposure, workers should not be
16 required to provide notice to employers of the disease as required of injuries and that the requirements for filing
17 of claims reflect consideration of when the worker knew or should have known that the worker's condition
18 resulted from an occupational disease. The legislature recognizes that occupational diseases in the workplace
19 are caused by events occurring on more than a single day or work shift and that it is within the legislature's
20 authority to define an occupational disease and establish the causal connection to the workplace."
