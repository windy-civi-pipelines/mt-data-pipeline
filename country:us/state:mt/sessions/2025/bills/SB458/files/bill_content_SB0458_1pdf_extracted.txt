10 "90-4-1307. Assessments. (1) (a) A local government may impose an assessment under a

13 (b) The term of the assessment may not exceed the useful life of an energy conservation project or
14 public safety and resiliency improvement project paid for by the assessment.
15 (2) Before entering into a contract with a record owner under a program, the local government
16 shall verify that:
17 (a) delinquent taxes, special assessments, or water or sewer charges are not due on the real
18 property; and

20 enhancements program are not due.
21 (3) (a) An assessment imposed under a commercial property-assessed capital enhancements
22 program, including any interest on the assessment and any penalty, constitutes a program lien against the real
23 property on which the assessment is imposed from the date of the assessment until the assessment, including
24 any interest or penalty, is paid in full. The lien is for outstanding assessments only, runs with the real property,
25 and has the same priority and status as other property tax and assessment liens.
26 (b) A governing body has the same rights in the case of delinquency in the payment of an
27 assessment as it does with respect to delinquent property taxes. When the assessment, including any interest
28 and penalty, is paid, the lien must be removed from the real property.
