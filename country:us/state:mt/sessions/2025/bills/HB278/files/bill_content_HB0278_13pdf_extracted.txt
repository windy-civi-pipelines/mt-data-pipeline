22 and, if the person is the driver of a vehicle, demand the person's driver's license and the vehicle's registration
23 and proof of insurance; and
24 (b) frisk the person and take other reasonably necessary steps for protection if the officer has
25 reasonable cause to suspect that the person is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or another person
26 present. The officer may take possession of any object that is discovered during the course of the frisk if the
27 officer has probable cause to believe that the object is a deadly weapon until the completion of the stop, at
28 which time the officer shall either immediately return the object, if legally possessed, or arrest the person.
