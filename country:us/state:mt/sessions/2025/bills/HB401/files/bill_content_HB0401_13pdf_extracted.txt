28 cells, fat cells, connective tissue, blood, and other components produced via cell culture, rather than from a

21 (l)(k) if it bears or contains an artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservative, unless it
22 bears labeling stating that fact, provided that to the extent that compliance with the requirements of this
23 subsection (8)(l) (8)(k) is impracticable, exemptions must be established by rules promulgated by the board; or
24 (m)(l) if it fails to bear directly on the meat and on its containers, as the board may by rule prescribe,
