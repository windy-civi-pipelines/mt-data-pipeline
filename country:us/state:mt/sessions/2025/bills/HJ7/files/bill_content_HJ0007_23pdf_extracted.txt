14
15 WHEREAS, the citizens of the United States, including the steadfast people of Montana, have
16 exercised their constitutional right to vote and Donald J. Trump has been duly elected as the 47th President of
17 the United States of America, decisively defeating radical leftist Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election,
18 with the esteemed J.D. Vance elected as Vice President; and
19 WHEREAS, President Trump secured a resounding landslide victory in Montana, winning 51 of the 56
20 counties in the state, reflecting that Montanans rejected the Democratic Party and its policies; and
21 WHEREAS, during his campaign, President Trump faced and triumphed over baseless, politically
22 motivated charges and relentless attacks orchestrated by partisan adversaries, demonstrating unparalleled
23 resilience and unwavering determination in his pursuit of the nation's highest office; and
24 WHEREAS, President Trump survived a heinous assassination attempt on July 13, 2024, during a
25 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he sustained a gunshot wound to his right ear, and a second
26 despicable assassination attempt was thwarted on September 15, 2024, at Trump International Golf Club in
27 West Palm Beach, Florida, where a suspect armed with a rifle was apprehended before causing harm; and
28 WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature overwhelmingly acknowledges and wholeheartedly supports

12 principles of the republic and endanger the cherished Montana way of life; and
13 WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature extends its profound gratitude to President Trump for his
14 endorsement of Senator Tim Sheehy, whose candidacy led to the defeat of far-left radical Senator Jon Tester,
15 thereby contributing to the restoration of conservative representation for Montana in the United States Senate;
16 and
17 WHEREAS, the state of Montana opposes the far-left judicial attacks on President Trump, recognizing
18 that such politically motivated actions undermine the integrity of our legal system. Furthermore, Montana faces
