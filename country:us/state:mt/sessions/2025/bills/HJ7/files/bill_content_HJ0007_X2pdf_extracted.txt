69th Legislature - 2025 HJ 7
MONTANA CONGRATULATING DONALD J. TRUMP ON HIS INAUGURATION AS PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
WHEREAS, the citizens of the United States, including the steadfast people of Montana, have
exercised their constitutional right to vote and Donald J. Trump has been duly elected as the 47th President of
the United States of America, decisively defeating radical leftist Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election,
with the esteemed J.D. Vance elected as Vice President; and
WHEREAS, President Trump secured a resounding landslide victory in Montana, winning 51 of the 56
counties in the state, reflecting that Montanans rejected the Democratic Party and its policies; and
WHEREAS, during his campaign, President Trump faced and triumphed over baseless, politically
motivated charges and relentless attacks orchestrated by partisan adversaries, demonstrating unparalleled
resilience and unwavering determination in his pursuit of the nation's highest office; and
WHEREAS, President Trump survived a heinous assassination attempt on July 13, 2024, during a
campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he sustained a gunshot wound to his right ear, and a second
despicable assassination attempt was thwarted on September 15, 2024, at Trump International Golf Club in
West Palm Beach, Florida, where a suspect armed with a rifle was apprehended before causing harm; and
WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature overwhelmingly acknowledges and wholeheartedly supports
President Trump's unwavering commitment to strengthening the United States of America through sound
governance, a robust economy, and the promotion of unity among its citizens; and
WHEREAS, the state of Montana stands in full support of President Trump's decisive border policies,
including unwavering efforts to secure the southern border and enforce immigration laws, aiming to protect the
nation's sovereignty, ensure public safety, and uphold the rule of law; and

69th Legislature - 2025 HJ 7
WHEREAS, the state of Montana vigorously supports and encourages President Trump in his
relentless efforts to combat the insidious "woke" agenda, aligning with Montana's steadfast commitment to
uphold traditional values, preserve its cultural heritage, and safeguard the well-being of its citizens; and
WHEREAS, the people of Montana and the Montana Legislature urge President Trump to continue his
valiant fight against the radical left, specifically targeting individuals and groups such as "The Squad" and
Senator Bernie Sanders, who advocate for extreme progressive policies that threaten the foundational
principles of the republic and endanger the cherished Montana way of life; and
WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature extends its profound gratitude to President Trump for his
endorsement of Senator Tim Sheehy, whose candidacy led to the defeat of far-left radical Senator Jon Tester,
thereby contributing to the restoration of conservative representation for Montana in the United States Senate;
and
WHEREAS, the state of Montana opposes the far-left judicial attacks on President Trump, recognizing
that such politically motivated actions undermine the integrity of our legal system. Furthermore, Montana faces
similar challenges from activist judges who legislate from the bench, disregarding the will of the people and
overstepping their constitutional authority; and
WHEREAS, President Trump's visionary leadership and unwavering commitment to conservative
principles resonate deeply with the proud citizens of Montana, reflecting shared values of individual liberty,
economic prosperity, and steadfast adherence to the founding principles of our great nation; and
WHEREAS, Montana recognizes the paramount importance of supporting the Office of the President to
ensure a prosperous, secure, and sovereign future for all Americans; and
WHEREAS, President Trump took the Oath of Office on January 20, 2025, and has officially begun his
term as President, ready to fulfill the sacred duties of leading the nation, protecting its Constitution, and serving
its people with unwavering commitment.
