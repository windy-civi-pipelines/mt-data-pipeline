that the instream private fish pond does not pose an unacceptable risk to game fish or fish species of special
concern in adjacent waters, including a risk from the introduction of a pathogen or an invasive species as
defined in 80-7-1003. Verification must be in the form of:
(a) a formal report from a department-approved professional fisheries consultant; or
(b) other reliable department-approved data and documentation.

operation, and maintenance of measures or devices to prevent fish in a private fish pond from escaping into

department to ascertain the presence of disease in fish or the illegal introduction of fish species. Whenever the
department has reasonable cause to believe that a fish species in the pond may have been illegally introduced
or may have a disease that may affect fish in another body of water, the department shall notify the landowner
or landowner's agent by mail or in person of the intention to enter upon the land and shall enter only after notice
has been given to the landowner or agent or after every reasonable effort has been made to notify the
landowner and receive permission to enter upon the land. Thereafter, the department may enter upon land
under the provisions of this subsection for the purposes of inspecting the pond, the species of fish in the pond,
the presence of disease in a fish species, the construction of any impoundment, dam, or fish barrier, and the

(8) If the department finds an illegal introduction of fish or the presence of disease in fish in a
licensed private fish pond or a natural lake, pond, or body of water, the department shall consult with the
landowner or the landowner's agent to determine the appropriate action unless an emergency exists. In an
emergency situation, the department may order or take appropriate action to address any threat to the state's
fisheries resources, including quarantine or destruction of fish, eggs, or the source of a disease. Whenever
privately owned fish are destroyed and the private owner is not responsible for an illegal introduction or the
introduction of fish with a disease, the department may replace the destroyed fish without charge to the private
owner. A landowner or agent who has granted permission for the department to enter is not considered
responsible for an illegal introduction of fish or disease unless proved otherwise.
(9) The department may adopt rules necessary for the regulation of private fish ponds as provided
in this section, including but not limited to department certification of a health standard, frequency of department
certification, pond design and function, inspections, reporting requirements, and other measures to prevent

department to ascertain the presence of disease in fish or the illegal introduction of fish species. Whenever the
department has reasonable cause to believe that a fish species in the pond may have been illegally introduced
or may have a disease that may affect fish in another body of water, the department shall notify the landowner
or landowner's agent by mail or in person of the intention to enter upon the land and shall enter only after notice
has been given to the landowner or agent or after every reasonable effort has been made to notify the
landowner and receive permission to enter upon the land. Thereafter, the department may enter upon land
under the provisions of this subsection for the purposes of inspecting the pond, the species of fish in the pond,

landowner or the landowner's agent to determine the appropriate action unless an emergency exists. In an
emergency situation, the department may order or take appropriate action to address any threat to the state's
fisheries resources, including quarantine or destruction of fish, eggs, or the source of a disease. Whenever
privately owned fish are destroyed and the private owner is not responsible for an illegal introduction or the
introduction of fish with a disease, the department may replace the destroyed fish without charge to the private
owner. A landowner or agent who has granted permission for the department to enter is not considered
responsible for an illegal introduction of fish or disease unless proved otherwise.
(9) The department may adopt rules necessary for the regulation of private fish ponds as provided
in this section, including but not limited to department certification of a health standard, frequency of department
certification, pond design and function, inspections, reporting requirements, and other measures to prevent
