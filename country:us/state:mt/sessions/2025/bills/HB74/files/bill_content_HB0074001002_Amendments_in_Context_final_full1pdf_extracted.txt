6 emergency situation, the department may order or take appropriate action to address any threat to the state's
7 fisheries resources, including quarantine or destruction of fish, eggs, or the source of a disease. Whenever
8 privately owned fish are destroyed and the private owner is not responsible for an illegal introduction or the

10 owner. A landowner or agent who has granted permission for the department to enter is not considered
11 responsible for an illegal introduction of fish or disease unless proved otherwise.
