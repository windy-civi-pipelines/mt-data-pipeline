12 WHEREAS, the Montana general stream adjudication established by Senate Bill No. 76 during the
13 1979 Montana Legislature was explicitly designed as a temporary judicial system with limited jurisdiction to
14 adjudicate water rights as they existed on July 1, 1973; and
15 WHEREAS, the Montana Water Court, created to implement this system, has operated in Bozeman for
16 over 44 years and is projected to complete its work within the next decade; and
17 WHEREAS, the temporary nature of the Water Court was a core feature of the original legislation, with
18 the express understanding that the Water Court's sole purpose was to adjudicate pre-1973 water rights; and
19 WHEREAS, maintaining the Water Court beyond its intended role represents an unnecessary
20 expansion of government, especially when local District Courts are fully capable of and have historically
21 handled water rights enforcement; and
22 WHEREAS, maintaining local control of water rights administration and enforcement, as outlined in
23 Senate Bill No. 76 in 1979, was a foundational principle of the legislation and remains the most effective way to
24 ensure accountability and responsiveness to the needs of Montanans; and
25 WHEREAS, transitioning water rights jurisdiction back to local District Courts once the limited work of
26 the Water Court is complete upholds the principles of limited government and good governance, reinforces
27 local control, and fulfills the commitment to eliminate unnecessary administrative layers; and
28 WHEREAS, the 69th Legislature intends to fulfill the original intent of Senate Bill No. 76 (1979) by
