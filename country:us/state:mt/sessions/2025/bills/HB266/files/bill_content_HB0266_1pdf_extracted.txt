15 nearest one hundredth; and
16 (c) a cumulative numerical comparison of the difference between the percentages reported in
17 subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b), rounded to the nearest one hundredth. If the sum of the percentages reported in
18 subsection (3)(a) is less than the sum of the percentages reported in subsection (3)(b), the difference is the
19 inflation reconciliation factor that must be incorporated in the next calculation of present law base for the
20 entitlements measured in subsection (3)(a) for the second year of the biennium to which the present law
