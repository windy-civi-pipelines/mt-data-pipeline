3 (a) compute an average enrollment by adding a count of regularly enrolled pupils who were
4 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
5 the first Monday in February of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if those dates do not fall on a
6 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
7 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
8 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
9 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-
10 related days may be included in the calculation.
11 (3) When a school district has approval to operate less than the minimum aggregate hours under
12 20-9-806, the total ANB must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of 20-9-805.
13 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), for the purpose of calculating ANB, enrollment in
14 an education program:
15 (i) from 180 to 359 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as one-quarter-
