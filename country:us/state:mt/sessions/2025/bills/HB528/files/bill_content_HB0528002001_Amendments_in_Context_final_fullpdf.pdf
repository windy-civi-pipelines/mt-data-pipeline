1 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
2 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
3 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
4 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
5 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
6 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
7 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
8 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
9 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
10 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
11 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
12 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
13 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
14 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
15 labor.
16 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
17 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
18 including newly taxable property.
19 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
20 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
21 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
22 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
23 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
24 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
25 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
26 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
27 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the

1 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
2 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
3 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
4 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
5 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
6 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
7 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
8 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
9 following tax year.
10 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
11 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
12 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
13 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
14 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
15 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
16 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:
17 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or
18 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
19 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
20 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
21 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
22 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
23 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
24 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
25 (8) (a) The Subject to subsection (8)(b), the department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the
26 number of mills to be imposed for purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439.
27 However, the number of mills calculated by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in

1 those sections. The mill calculation must be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not
2 result in an even tenth of a mill, then the calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
3 (b) For the property tax year beginning January 1, 2025, the department shall calculate, on a
4 statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-
5 9-360 that result in a reduction in revenue to the school equalization and property tax reduction account in 20-9-
6 336 and to the state special revenue fund of not more than $50 million. The number of mills calculated by the
7 department pursuant to this subsection (8)(b) must be used in subsequent tax years.
8 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
9 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
10 (ii) a levy to repay taxes paid under protest as provided in 15-1-402;
11 (iii) an emergency levy authorized under 10-3-405, 20-9-168, or 20-15-326;
12 (iv) a levy for the support of a study commission under 7-3-184;
13 (v) a levy for the support of a newly established regional resource authority;
14 (vi) the portion that is the amount in excess of the base contribution of a governmental entity's
15 property tax levy for contributions for group benefits excluded under 2-9-212 or 2-18-703;
16 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
17 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
18 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
19 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
20 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
21 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
22 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) may not be included in the amount of property taxes
23 actually assessed in a subsequent year.
24 (10) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
25 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
26 authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated
27 operating funds by a county or municipality during that time.

3 improvements, or newly taxable value in a governmental unit."

5 NEW SECTION. Section 6. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
6 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments have transitioned to mill levies that
7 adjust downward when taxable value increases to comply with 15-10-420 revenue limitations. This floating mill
8 levy concept lowers the number of mills levied when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
9 property taxes. However, when mill levies are fixed and property values increase, property taxes are not
10 mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy. Consequently, fixed mill levies prevent the
11 legislature from exercising the power to tax in a manner that is fair and consistent for all taxpayers in the state.
12 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
13 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
14 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5(1), of the Montana constitution to adopt,
15 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
16 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
17 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
18 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
19 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
20 of Initiative 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999. Given the
21 significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the last 5
22 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates for
23 primary residences in a consistent manner, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
24 These statutory provisions do not preempt, limit or otherwise modify city charter provisions establishing
25 executive, legislative, or administrative structures in accordance with Article XI, section 5(3), of the Montana
26 constitution.
27 (3) Commencing in fiscal year 2026, the provisions of 15-10-420 apply to and are controlling for all

1 self-governing local government units, and any mill levy limits set forth in a self-governing local government’s
2 charter are null and void.
3 (4) Local governments with a voted mill levy authorized as a specific number of mills prior to [the
4 effective date of this act] may, starting in fiscal year 2026, levy the number of mills each successive fiscal year
5 that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 for the voted mill levy until the
6 taxable value of the local government equals or exceeds the taxable value in fiscal year 2025, then levy the
7 specific number of mills approved by the voters.
