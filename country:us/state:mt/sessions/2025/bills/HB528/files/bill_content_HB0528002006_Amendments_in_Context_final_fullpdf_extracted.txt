1 following tax year.
2 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was

19 However, the number of mills calculated by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in
20 those sections. The mill calculation must be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not
21 result in an even tenth of a mill, then the calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
22 (b) For the property tax year beginning January 1, 2025, the department shall calculate, on a
23 statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-

22 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
23 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
24 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
25 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
26 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.

2 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
3 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
4 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
5 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
6 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of

8 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
9 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
10 including newly taxable property.

17 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
18 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
19 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the

22 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
23 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
24 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as

1 following tax year.
2 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
3 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
4 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.

19 However, the number of mills calculated by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in
20 those sections. The mill calculation must be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not
21 result in an even tenth of a mill, then the calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
22 (b) For the property tax year beginning January 1, 2025, the department shall calculate, on a
23 statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-
24 9-360 that result in a reduction in revenue to the school equalization and property tax reduction account in 20-9-
25 336 and to the state special revenue fund of not more than $50 million. The number of mills calculated by the
26 department pursuant to this subsection (8)(b) must be used in subsequent tax years.
