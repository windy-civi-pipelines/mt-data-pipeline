14 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
15 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
16 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
17 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
18 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
19 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
20 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
21 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
22 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
23 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
24 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
25 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,

14 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
15 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
16 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
17 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
18 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
19 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
20 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
21 following tax year.
22 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
23 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
24 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
25 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
26 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
