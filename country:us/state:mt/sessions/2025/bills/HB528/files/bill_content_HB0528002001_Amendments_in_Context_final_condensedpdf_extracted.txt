1 procedures and powers of local governments;
2 (h) Title 70, chapters 30 and 31.
3 (2) These provisions are a prohibition on the self-government unit acting other than as provided.
4 (3) (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1)(g) and except as provided in subsection
5 (3)(b), self-governing local government units are not subject to the mill levy limits established by state law.
6 (b) The provisions of 15-10-420 apply to self-governing local government units, and expressly
7 override any mill levy limits set forth in the charter."

9 Section 2. Section 15-6-133, MCA, is amended to read:
10 "15-6-133. Class three property -- description -- taxable percentage. (1) Class three property
11 includes:
12 (a) agricultural land as defined in 15-7-202;
13 (b) nonproductive patented mining claims outside the limits of an incorporated city or town held by
14 an owner for the ultimate purpose of developing the mineral interests on the property. For the purposes of this
15 subsection (1)(b), the following provisions apply:
16 (i) The claim may not include any property that is used for residential purposes, recreational
17 purposes as described in 70-16-301, or commercial purposes as defined in 15-1-101 or any property the
18 surface of which is being used for other than mining purposes or has a separate and independent value for
19 other purposes.
20 (ii) Improvements to the property that would not disqualify the parcel are taxed as otherwise
21 provided in this title, including that portion of the land upon which the improvements are located and that is
22 reasonably required for the use of the improvements.
23 (iii) Nonproductive patented mining claim property must be valued as if the land were devoted to
24 agricultural grazing use.
25 (c) parcels of land of 20 acres or more but less than 160 acres under one ownership that are not
26 eligible for valuation, assessment, and taxation as agricultural land under 15-7-202(1), which are considered to
27 be nonqualified agricultural land. Nonqualified agricultural land may not be devoted to a commercial or

1 (11) The department may adopt rules to implement this section. The rules may include a method for
2 calculating the percentage of change in valuation for purposes of determining the elimination of property, new
3 improvements, or newly taxable value in a governmental unit."

5 NEW SECTION. Section 6. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
6 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments have transitioned to mill levies that
7 adjust downward when taxable value increases to comply with 15-10-420 revenue limitations. This floating mill
8 levy concept lowers the number of mills levied when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
9 property taxes. However, when mill levies are fixed and property values increase, property taxes are not
10 mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy. Consequently, fixed mill levies prevent the
11 legislature from exercising the power to tax in a manner that is fair and consistent for all taxpayers in the state.
12 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
13 constitution, from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
14 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5(1), of the Montana constitution to adopt,
15 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
16 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
17 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
18 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
19 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
20 of Initiative 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999. Given the
21 significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the last 5
22 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates for
23 primary residences in a consistent manner, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
24 These statutory provisions do not preempt, limit or otherwise modify city charter provisions establishing
25 executive, legislative, or administrative structures in accordance with Article XI, section 5(3), of the Montana
26 constitution.
27 (3) Commencing in fiscal year 2026, the provisions of 15-10-420 apply to and are controlling for all

1 self-governing local government units, and any mill levy limits set forth in a self-governing local government’s
2 charter are null and void.
3 (4) Local governments with a voted mill levy authorized as a specific number of mills prior to [the
4 effective date of this act] may, starting in fiscal year 2026, levy the number of mills each successive fiscal year
5 that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 for the voted mill levy until the
6 taxable value of the local government equals or exceeds the taxable value in fiscal year 2025, then levy the
7 specific number of mills approved by the voters.
