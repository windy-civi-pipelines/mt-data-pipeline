13
14 Section 1. Section 15-1-121, MCA, is amended to read:
15 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
16 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
17 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
18 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
19 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
20 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
21 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
22 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
23 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
24 sending a portion to other local governments.
25 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
26 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
27 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),

10 Title 77, chapter 1, part 5.
11 (3) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), the total amount received by each local government in
12 the prior fiscal year as an entitlement share payment under this section is the base component for the
13 subsequent fiscal year distribution, and in each subsequent year the prior year entitlement share payment,
14 including any reimbursement payments received pursuant to subsection (7), is each local government's base
15 component. The sum of all local governments' base components is the fiscal year entitlement share pool.
16 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool
17 must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4). The
18 amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal
19 year.
20 (b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement
21 share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:
22 (i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two
23 factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as
24 recorded on the statewide accounting, budgeting, and human resource system. The first factor is the sum of the
25 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in
26 subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous
27 completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75. The second factor is the sum of the

1 revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as
2 provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the
3 sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources
4 multiplied by 0.25.
5 (ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is
6 the lesser of:
7 (A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor; or
8 (B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.
9 (iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1. Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv),
10 the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to
11 determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.
12 (iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:
13 (A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;
14 (B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;
15 (C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii). The rate
16 must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated
17 using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).
18 (5) As used in this section, "local government" means a county, a consolidated local government,
19 an incorporated city, and an incorporated town. A local government does not include a tax increment financing
20 district provided for in subsection (8). The county or consolidated local government is responsible for making an
21 allocation from the county's or consolidated local government's share of the entitlement share pool to each
22 special district within the county or consolidated local government in a manner that reasonably reflects each
23 special district's loss of revenue sources for which reimbursement is provided in this section. The allocation for
24 each special district that existed in 2002 must be based on the relative proportion of the loss of revenue in
25 2002.
26 (6) (a) The entitlement share pools calculated in this section, the amounts distributed under 15-1-
27 123(4) for local governments, the funding provided for in subsection (8) of this section, and the amounts

1 distributed under 15-1-123(5) for tax increment financing districts are statutorily appropriated, as provided in 17-
2 7-502, from the general fund to the department for distribution to local governments.
3 (b) (i) The growth amount is the difference between the entitlement share pool in the current fiscal
4 year and the entitlement share pool in the previous fiscal year. The growth factor in the entitlement share must
5 be calculated separately for:
6 (A) counties;
7 (B) consolidated local governments; and
8 (C) incorporated cities and towns.
9 (ii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for counties must be allocated as follows:
10 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each county's percentage of the prior
11 fiscal year entitlement share pool for all counties; and
12 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each county's
13 population bears to the state population not residing within consolidated local governments as determined by
14 the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the
15 United States bureau of the census.
16 (iii) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for consolidated local governments must be allocated as
17 follows:
18 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each consolidated local
19 government's percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all consolidated local governments;
20 and
21 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each
22 consolidated local government's population bears to the state's total population residing within consolidated
23 local governments as determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department
24 of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
25 (iv) In each fiscal year, the growth amount for incorporated cities and towns must be allocated as
26 follows:
27 (A) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon each incorporated city's or town's

1 percentage of the prior fiscal year entitlement share pool for all incorporated cities and towns; and
2 (B) 50% of the growth amount must be allocated based upon the percentage that each city's or
3 town's population bears to the state's total population residing within incorporated cities and towns as
4 determined by the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as
5 supplied by the United States bureau of the census.
6 (v) In each fiscal year, the amount of the entitlement share pool before the growth amount or
7 adjustments made under subsection (7) are applied is to be distributed to each local government in the same
8 manner as the entitlement share pool was distributed in the prior fiscal year.
9 (7) (a) If the legislature enacts a reimbursement provision that is to be distributed pursuant to this
10 section, the department shall determine the reimbursement amount as provided in the enactment and add the
11 appropriate amount to the entitlement share distribution under this section. The total entitlement share
12 distributions in a fiscal year, including distributions made pursuant to this subsection, equal the local fiscal year
13 entitlement share pool. The ratio of each local government's distribution from the entitlement share pool must
14 be recomputed to determine each local government's ratio to be used in the subsequent year's distribution
15 determination under subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A).
16 (b) For fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, the growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not
17 apply to the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in 15-1-123(1)
18 and (2). The department shall calculate the portion of the entitlement share pool attributable to the
19 reimbursement in 15-1-123(1) and (2), including the application of the growth rate in previous fiscal years, for
20 counties, consolidated local governments, and cities and, for fiscal year 2018 and thereafter, apply the growth
21 rate for that portion of the entitlement share pool as provided in 15-1-123(3).
22 (c) The growth amount resulting from the application of the growth rate in 15-1-123(3) must be
23 allocated as provided in subsections (6)(b)(ii)(A), (6)(b)(iii)(A), and (6)(b)(iv)(A) of this section.
24 (d) The growth rate provided for in subsection (4) does not apply to the portion of the entitlement
25 share pool attributable to the reimbursement provided for in [section 7].
26 (8) (a) Except for a tax increment financing district entitled to a reimbursement under 15-1-123(5),
27 if a tax increment financing district was not in existence during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, then the

1 tax increment financing district is not entitled to any funding. If a tax increment financing district referred to in
2 subsection (8)(b) terminates, then the funding for the district provided for in subsection (8)(b) terminates.
3 (b) One-half of the payments provided for in this subsection (8)(b) must be made by November 30
4 and the other half by May 31 of each year. Subject to subsection (8)(a), the entitlement share for tax increment
5 financing districts is as follows:

Flathead Whitefish District 148,194
Gallatin Bozeman - downtown 31,158
Missoula Missoula - 1-1C 225,251
Missoula Missoula - 4-1C 30,009
6 (9) The estimated fiscal year entitlement share pool and any subsequent entitlement share pool for
7 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
8 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
9 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
10 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
11 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
12 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
13 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
14 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
15 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
16 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
17 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
18 (i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and
19 (ii) fails to remit any amounts collected on behalf of the state as required by 15-1-504 or as

1 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
2 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
3 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
4 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
5 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under

9 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
10 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,

2 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
3 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
4 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
5 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the

16 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
17 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
18 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
19 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
20 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
21 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
22 (8) (a) The Subject to subsection (8)(b), the department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the
23 number of mills to be imposed for purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439.
24 However, the number of mills calculated by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in
25 those sections. The mill calculation must be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not
26 result in an even tenth of a mill, then the calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
27 (b) For the property tax year beginning January 1, 2025, the department shall calculate, on a

1 statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-
2 9-360 that result in a reduction in revenue to the school equalization and property tax reduction account in 20-9-
3 336 and to the state special revenue fund of not more than $50 million. The number of mills calculated by the
4 department pursuant to this subsection (8)(b) must be used in subsequent tax years.
5 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
6 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
7 (ii) a levy to repay taxes paid under protest as provided in 15-1-402;
8 (iii) an emergency levy authorized under 10-3-405, 20-9-168, or 20-15-326;
9 (iv) a levy for the support of a study commission under 7-3-184;
10 (v) a levy for the support of a newly established regional resource authority;

13 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
14 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
15 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
16 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
17 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
18 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
19 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) may not be included in the amount of property taxes
20 actually assessed in a subsequent year.
21 (10) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
22 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
23 authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated
24 operating funds by a county or municipality during that time.
25 (11) The department may adopt rules to implement this section. The rules may include a method for
26 calculating the percentage of change in valuation for purposes of determining the elimination of property, new
27 improvements, or newly taxable value in a governmental unit."

2 NEW SECTION. Section 6. Legislative findings -- local government charters and fixed mill levy
3 limits superseded. (1) (a) The legislature finds that most local governments set mill levies that adjust
4 downward when taxable value increases under 15-10-420. This floating mill levy concept automatically lowers
5 the number of mills levied against a taxpayer when property values increase, which mitigates increases in
6 property values. However, when mill levies are fixed, the opposite occurs when property values increase, and
7 property taxes are not automatically mitigated for taxpayers that are levied based on a fixed mill levy.
8 (b) The legislature finds further that it is prohibited under Article VIII, section 2, of the Montana
9 constitution from suspending or contracting away the power to tax. The legislature also recognizes and
10 respects the power of local governments under Article XI, section 5, of the Montana constitution to adopt,
11 amend, revise, or abandon a charter.
12 (2) As a matter of policy, the legislature intends to supersede local government charters that fix mill
13 levy limits for the limited purpose of exercising the power to tax while also maintaining local government
14 revenue sources without raising taxes on residential taxpayers. Having considered all options on a statewide
15 basis, the legislature finds the statutory structure of the property tax has evolved significantly since the passage
16 of Initiative Measure No. 105 on November 4, 1986, and the enactment of 15-10-420 by the legislature in 1999.
17 Given the significant change in the structure of the property tax and the rising cost of residential property in the
18 last 5 years, there is a compelling interest to all the citizens of the state to lower residential property tax rates
19 for primary residences, which can only be accomplished by this section and 15-10-420.
20 (3) A local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a specific
21 number of mills that may be imposed in the charter shall levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 and
22 subsequent tax years that will generate the amount of property taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025, without
23 amending or revising the charter. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
24 levied in fiscal year 2026.
25 (4) A taxing entity with a local mill levy limit of a specific number of mills that may be imposed that
26 was authorized by the voters before [the effective date of this section] may:
27 (a) elect to transition a voted mill levy to a dollar-based mill levy equal to the amount of property

1 taxes assessed in fiscal year 2025 and thereafter subject to the provisions of 15-10-420(1)(a); or
2 (b) levy the number of mills in fiscal year 2026 that will generate the amount of property taxes
3 assessed in fiscal year 2025. In fiscal years after 2026, the local government shall levy the number of mills
4 levied in fiscal year 2026.

6 NEW SECTION. Section 7. Reimbursement for loss of revenue from certain fixed mill levies. (1)
7 The department shall reimburse each taxing entity as provided in this section for the revenue loss resulting from
8 the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] for the following levies:
9 (a) levies of a local government with a charter form of government that includes a mill levy limit of a
10 specific number of mills that may be imposed in the charter; and
11 (b) levies stated as a specific mill levy authorized by voters before [the effective date of this
12 section].
13 (2) For fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the property
14 tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue collected in
15 fiscal year 2025. After fiscal year 2026, the reimbursement must be equal to the difference between the
16 property tax revenue collected from the levies provided for in subsection (1) and the property tax revenue that
17 would be collected in the current fiscal year using the mill levy that would raise the fiscal year 2025 tax revenue
18 using the fiscal year 2026 taxable value.
19 (3) A taxing entity eligible to receive a reimbursement under this section shall report the loss in
20 revenue from the tax rate reductions in 15-6-134 as amended by [this act] to the department of revenue.
21 (4) A reimbursement provided for in this section may only be made for 2 years after [the effective
22 date of this section].
23 (5) The department shall distribute the reimbursements with the entitlement share payments under
24 15-1-121(7).

26 NEW SECTION. Section 8. Codification instruction. (1) [Section 6] is intended to be codified as an
27 integral part of Title 15, chapter 6, and the provisions of Title 15, chapter 6, apply to [section 6].

7 commissioner that a court of final disposition finds that [section 6] is invalid. The department of revenue shall
8 submit certification within 30 days of the occurrence of the contingency.

10 NEW SECTION. Section 10. Retroactive applicability. [This act] applies retroactively, within the
11 meaning of 1-2-109, to tax years beginning after December 31, 2024, and to the reappraisal cycle beginning
12 January 1, 2025.
13
14 NEW SECTION. Section 11. Contingent termination. [Sections 1 and 7] terminate on the date that
15 the department of revenue certifies to the code commissioner that reimbursements authorized pursuant to
16 [section 7] have been completed. The department of revenue shall submit certification within 30 days of the
17 occurrence of the contingency.
