1 SECTION 4. SECTION 15-10-420, MCA, IS AMENDED TO READ:
2 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
3 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
4 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
5 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
6 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
7 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
8 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
9 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
10 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
11 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
12 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
13 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
14 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
15 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
16 labor.
17 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
18 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
19 including newly taxable property.
20 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
21 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
22 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
23 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
24 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
25 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
26 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
27 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
28 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 528
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0528.2
1 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
2 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
3 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
4 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
5 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
6 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
7 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
8 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
9 following tax year.
10 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
11 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
12 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
13 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
14 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
15 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
16 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:

19 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
20 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
21 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
22 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
23 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative

27 However, the number of mills calculated by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in
28 those sections. The mill calculation must be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 528

69th Legislature 2025 HB0528.2
1 result in an even tenth of a mill, then the calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
2 (b) For the property tax year beginning January 1, 2025, the department shall calculate, on a
3 statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-
4 9-360 that result in a reduction in revenue to the school equalization and property tax reduction account in 20-9-
5 336 and to the state special revenue fund of not more than $50 million. The number of mills calculated by the
6 department pursuant to this subsection (8)(b) must be used in subsequent tax years.

24 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
25 authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated

22 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
23 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
24 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
25 (8) (a) The Subject to subsection (8)(b), the department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the
26 number of mills to be imposed for purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439.

3 statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-
4 9-360 that result in a reduction in revenue to the school equalization and property tax reduction account in 20-9-
5 336 and to the state special revenue fund of not more than $50 million. The number of mills calculated by the
6 department pursuant to this subsection (8)(b) must be used in subsequent tax years.

8 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

12 (v) a levy for the support of a newly established regional resource authority;

18 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
19 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
20 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
21 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) may not be included in the amount of property taxes
22 actually assessed in a subsequent year.
23 (10) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
24 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
25 authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated
26 operating funds by a county or municipality during that time.
27 (11) The department may adopt rules to implement this section. The rules may include a method for
