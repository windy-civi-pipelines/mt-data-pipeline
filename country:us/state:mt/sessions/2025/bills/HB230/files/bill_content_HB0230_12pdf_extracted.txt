69th Legislature 2025 HB 230.1
1 (a) provide coverage of health care services for low-income Montanans;
2 (b) improve the readiness of program participants to enter the workforce or obtain better-paying
3 jobs; and
4 (c) reduce the dependence of Montanans on public assistance programs.
5 (2) The legislature finds that improving the delivery of health care services to Montanans requires
6 state government, health care providers, patient advocates, and other parties interested in high-quality,
7 affordable health care to collaborate in order to:
8 (a) increase the availability of high-quality health care to Montanans;
9 (b) provide greater value for the tax dollars spent on the Montana medicaid program;
10 (c) reduce health care costs;
11 (d) provide incentives that encourage Montanans to take greater responsibility for their personal
12 health;

14 (f) reduce or minimize the shifting of payment for unreimbursed health care costs to patients with
15 health insurance.
16 (3) The legislature further finds that providing greater value for the dollars spent on the medicaid
17 program requires considering options for delivering services in a more efficient and cost-effective manner,
18 including but not limited to:
19 (a) offering incentives to encourage health care providers to achieve measurable performance
20 outcomes;
21 (b) improving the coordination of care among health care providers who participate in the medicaid
22 program;

24 (d) exploring methods of medicaid payment that promote quality of care and efficiencies.
25 (4) The legislature further finds that providing necessary job training, skill development, or
26 supportive services and establishing community engagement requirements for individuals who need assistance
27 with health care costs could help those individuals obtain employment that has health care coverage benefits or
28 that would allow them to purchase their own health insurance coverage.

4 qualify for the programs; and
5 (b) state policymakers have an interest in testing the effectiveness of wellness incentives in order
6 to collect and analyze information about the correlation between wellness incentives and health status.
7 (6) The purposes of the act are to:
8 (a) modify and enhance Montana's health care delivery system to provide access to high-quality,
9 affordable health care for all Montana citizens; and
10 (b) provide low-income Montanans with opportunities to improve their readiness for work or to
11 obtain higher-paying jobs.

69th Legislature 2025 HB 230.1
1 (a) provide coverage of health care services for low-income Montanans;
2 (b) improve the readiness of program participants to enter the workforce or obtain better-paying
3 jobs; and
4 (c) reduce the dependence of Montanans on public assistance programs.
5 (2) The legislature finds that improving the delivery of health care services to Montanans requires
6 state government, health care providers, patient advocates, and other parties interested in high-quality,
7 affordable health care to collaborate in order to:
8 (a) increase the availability of high-quality health care to Montanans;
9 (b) provide greater value for the tax dollars spent on the Montana medicaid program;
10 (c) reduce health care costs;
11 (d) provide incentives that encourage Montanans to take greater responsibility for their personal
12 health;
13 (e) boost Montana's economy by reducing the costs of uncompensated care; and
14 (f) reduce or minimize the shifting of payment for unreimbursed health care costs to patients with
15 health insurance.
16 (3) The legislature further finds that providing greater value for the dollars spent on the medicaid
17 program requires considering options for delivering services in a more efficient and cost-effective manner,
18 including but not limited to:
19 (a) offering incentives to encourage health care providers to achieve measurable performance
20 outcomes;
21 (b) improving the coordination of care among health care providers who participate in the medicaid
22 program;
23 (c) reducing preventable hospital readmissions; and
24 (d) exploring methods of medicaid payment that promote quality of care and efficiencies.
25 (4) The legislature further finds that providing necessary job training, skill development, or
26 supportive services and establishing community engagement requirements for individuals who need assistance
27 with health care costs could help those individuals obtain employment that has health care coverage benefits or
28 that would allow them to purchase their own health insurance coverage.

4 qualify for the programs; and
5 (b) state policymakers have an interest in testing the effectiveness of wellness incentives in order
6 to collect and analyze information about the correlation between wellness incentives and health status.
7 (6) The purposes of the act are to:
8 (a) modify and enhance Montana's health care delivery system to provide access to high-quality,
9 affordable health care for all Montana citizens; and
10 (b) provide low-income Montanans with opportunities to improve their readiness for work or to
11 obtain higher-paying jobs.
