17 Section 7. Section 53-6-1302, MCA, is amended to read:
18 "53-6-1302. (Temporary) Montana HELP Act program -- legislative findings and purpose. (1)
19 There is a Montana Health and Economic Livelihood Partnership Act program established through a
20 collaborative effort of the department of public health and human services and the department of labor and
21 industry to:
22 (a) provide coverage of health care services for low-income Montanans;
23 (b) improve the readiness of program participants to enter the workforce or obtain better-paying
24 jobs; and
25 (c) reduce the dependence of Montanans on public assistance programs.
26 (2) The legislature finds that improving the delivery of health care services to Montanans requires
27 state government, health care providers, patient advocates, and other parties interested in high-quality,
28 affordable health care to collaborate in order to:

69th Legislature 2025 LC1217.1

13 outcomes;
14 (b) improving the coordination of care among health care providers who participate in the medicaid
15 program;

17 (d) exploring methods of medicaid payment that promote quality of care and efficiencies.
18 (4) The legislature further finds that providing necessary job training, skill development, or
19 supportive services and establishing community engagement requirements for individuals who need assistance
20 with health care costs could help those individuals obtain employment that has health care coverage benefits or
21 that would allow them to purchase their own health insurance coverage.
22 (5) The legislature further finds that:
23 (a) it is important to implement additional fraud, waste, and abuse safeguards to protect and
24 preserve the integrity of the medicaid program and the unemployment insurance program for individuals who
25 qualify for the programs; and
26 (b) state policymakers have an interest in testing the effectiveness of wellness incentives in order
27 to collect and analyze information about the correlation between wellness incentives and health status.
