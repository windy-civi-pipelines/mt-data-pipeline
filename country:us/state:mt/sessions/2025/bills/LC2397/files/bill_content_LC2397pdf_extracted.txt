Section 1:
69th Legislature LC2397.1
1 _____________ JOINT RESOLUTION NO. _____________
3
4 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
5 MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY OF SCHOOL DISTRICT REORGANIZATION; AND
6 REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
7
8 WHEREAS, with approximately 400 school districts for 150,000 K-12 students, Montana has the lowest
9 average school district enrollment in the nation; and
10 WHEREAS, the executive summary of the 2005 contracted study on school funding stated: "As a result
11 of comparing the state of Montana with other selected states, the overall policy observation was offered as to
12 the conclusion that the state of Montana faces a series of fiscal challenges if it is to fund a quality education.
13 These fiscal challenges are exacerbated given the number of small schools and small school districts and the
14 necessary state and local funding to meet the legislative mandates of a quality education"; and
15 WHEREAS, the high number of school districts complicates school funding and accountability and
16 increases the difficulty of ensuring both taxpayer equity and the guarantee of equality of educational opportunity
17 enshrined in Article X of the Montana Constitution; and
18 WHEREAS, the Legislature acknowledges that elected boards of trustees have constitutionally granted
19 supervision and control of the schools in their school district; and
20 WHEREAS, the Legislature acknowledges that geographic realities and demographic changes may
21 require school districts to cross county and other jurisdictional boundaries; and
22 WHEREAS, the Legislature's intent to explore school district administrative efficiencies and
23 simplification does not equate to an aim to close rural schools but instead reflects the objective to drive more
24 resources to high-quality classroom instruction and well-compensated teachers.
25
26 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
27 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
28 That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory

11 isolated schools and school districts;
12 (4) examine existing Montana laws and funding mechanisms that impact school district
13 reorganization; and
14 (5) research alternatives to school district reorganization that lead to similar efficiencies.
15 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the committee undertake this study promptly in a manner and on a
16 timeline that allows the committee to inform the School Funding Interim Commission of its findings at a point
17 when the Commission can utilize those findings in its work.

19 requirements, be concluded prior to May 15, 2026.
