6 mountain lions, black bears, and grizzly bears, subject to the following provisions:
7 (1) The board shall establish eligibility requirements for reimbursement, which must provide that all
8 Montana livestock producers are eligible for coverage for losses by wolves, mountain lions, black bears, and
9 grizzly bears to cattle, swine, horses, mules, sheep, goats, llamas, and livestock guard dogs on state, federal,
10 tribal, and private land.
11 (2) (a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), the board may reimburse confirmed and probable
12 livestock losses at an amount not to exceed the fair market value of the livestock.
13 (b) The board may reimburse confirmed and probable livestock losses by paying a multiplier of the
14 fair market value of the livestock based on a board-determined region.
15 (c) Before the board may issue a reimbursement for losses to a livestock producer eligible for
16 coverage for losses, the department of revenue shall certify that the livestock producer has paid per capita fees
17 as required by 15-24-921. Except for a tribal member or tribal entity participating in an authorized agreement
18 pursuant to 2-15-3113, a livestock producer may not receive a reimbursement for losses until the producer has
19 paid any delinquent per capita fees.
20 (3) Other losses may be reimbursed at rates determined by the board.

22 loss for which wolves, mountain lions, black bears, or grizzly bears may be responsible. The claim process
23 must set out a clear and concise method for documenting and processing claims for reimbursement for
24 livestock losses.
25 (5) Names, addresses, and other personally identifiable information of claimants must remain
26 confidential and may not be released.
27 (6) (a) A process must be established to allow livestock producers to appeal reimbursement

69th Legislature 2025 HB 356.1
1 writing, stating the reasons for the appeal and providing documentation supporting the appeal. If the
2 documentation is incomplete, the board or a producer may consult with the U.S. department of agriculture
3 wildlife services to complete the documentation.
4 (b) The board may not accept any appeal on the question of whether the loss was or was not a
5 confirmed or probable loss because that final determination lies solely with the U.S. department of agriculture
6 wildlife services and may not be changed by the board.
7 (c) The board shall hold a hearing on an appeal within 90 days of receipt of the written appeal,
8 allowing the staff adjuster and the producer to present their positions. A decision must be rendered by the
9 board within 30 days after the hearing. The producer must be notified in writing of the board's decision.

12 by a wolf, mountain lion, black bear, or grizzly bear, including but not limited to the presence of bite marks
13 indicative of the spacing of tooth punctures of wolves, mountain lions, black bear, or grizzly bears and
14 associated subcutaneous hemorrhaging and tissue damage indicating that the attack occurred while the animal
15 was alive, feeding patterns on the carcass, fresh tracks, scat, hair rubbed off on fences or brush, eyewitness
16 accounts, or other physical evidence that allows a reasonable inference of wolf, mountain lion, black bear, or
17 grizzly bear predation on an animal that has been largely consumed.
18 (b) "Fair market value" means:
19 (i) for commercial sheep more than 1 year old, the average price of sheep of similar age and sex

1 (viii) for other livestock, the average price paid at the most recent public auction for the type of
2 animal lost or the replacement price as determined by the board.
3 (c) "Probable" means the presence of some evidence to suggest possible predation but a lack of
4 sufficient evidence to clearly confirm predation by a particular species. A kill may be classified as probable
5 depending on factors including but not limited to recent confirmed predation by the suspected depredating
6 species in the same or a nearby area, recent observation of the livestock by the owner or the owner's
7 employees, and telemetry monitoring data, sightings, howling, or fresh tracks suggesting that the suspected
8 depredating species may have been in the area when the depredation occurred."
