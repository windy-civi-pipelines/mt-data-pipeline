16 as required by 15-24-921. Except for a tribal member or tribal entity participating in an authorized agreement

24 (5) Names, addresses, and other personally identifiable information of claimants must remain

4 confirmed or probable loss because that final determination lies solely with the U.S. department of agriculture
5 wildlife services and may not be changed by the board.
6 (c) The board shall hold a hearing on an appeal within 90 days of receipt of the written appeal,
