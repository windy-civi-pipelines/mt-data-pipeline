conservation and management plan, the Montana mountain lion management plan, the Montana black bear
management plan, and the Montana grizzly bear management plan and established in 2-15-3111 through 2-15-
3113, with funds provided through the accounts established in 81-1-110, in order to minimize losses caused by
wolves, mountain lions, black bears, and grizzly bears to livestock producers and to reimburse livestock
producers for livestock losses from wolf, mountain lion, black bear, and grizzly bear predation.
(2) The board consists of five members, appointed by the governor, as follows:
(a) three members who are actively involved in the livestock industry and who have knowledge
and experience with regard to wildlife impacts or management; and
(b) two members of the general public who are or have been actively involved in wildlife
conservation or wildlife management and who have knowledge and experience with regard to livestock
production or management.
(3) The board is designated as a quasi-judicial board for the purposes of 2-15-124.

term of up to 12 months subject to renewal based on availability of funds, satisfaction of program requirements,

Section 4:
Section 3. Section 2-15-3112, MCA, is amended to read:
"2-15-3112. Livestock loss mitigation program -- definitions. The livestock loss board shall
establish and administer a program to reimburse livestock producers for livestock losses caused by wolves,
mountain lions, black bears, and grizzly bears, subject to the following provisions:
(1) The board shall establish eligibility requirements for reimbursement, which must provide that all
Montana livestock producers are eligible for coverage for losses by wolves, mountain lions, black bears, and
grizzly bears to cattle, swine, horses, mules, sheep, goats, llamas, and livestock guard dogs on state, federal,
tribal, and private land.
(2) (a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), the board may reimburse confirmed and probable
livestock losses at an amount not to exceed the fair market value of the livestock.
(b) The board may reimburse confirmed and probable livestock losses by paying a multiplier of the
fair market value of the livestock based on a board-determined region.
(c) Before the board may issue a reimbursement for losses to a livestock producer eligible for
coverage for losses, the department of revenue shall certify that the livestock producer has paid per capita fees
as required by 15-24-921. Except for a tribal member or tribal entity participating in an authorized agreement
pursuant to 2-15-3113, a livestock producer may not receive a reimbursement for losses until the producer has
paid any delinquent per capita fees.
(3) Other losses may be reimbursed at rates determined by the board.
(4) A claim process must be established to be used when a livestock producer suffers a livestock
loss for which wolves, mountain lions, black bears, or grizzly bears may be responsible. The claim process
must set out a clear and concise method for documenting and processing claims for reimbursement for
livestock losses.
(5) Names, addresses, and other personally identifiable information of claimants must remain
confidential and may not be released.
(6) (a) A process must be established to allow livestock producers to appeal reimbursement
decisions. A producer may appeal a staff adjuster's decision by notifying the staff adjuster and the board in
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – HB 356
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 356
writing, stating the reasons for the appeal and providing documentation supporting the appeal. If the
documentation is incomplete, the board or a producer may consult with the U.S. department of agriculture
wildlife services to complete the documentation.
(b) The board may not accept any appeal on the question of whether the loss was or was not a
confirmed or probable loss because that final determination lies solely with the U.S. department of agriculture
wildlife services and may not be changed by the board.
(c) The board shall hold a hearing on an appeal within 90 days of receipt of the written appeal,
allowing the staff adjuster and the producer to present their positions. A decision must be rendered by the
board within 30 days after the hearing. The producer must be notified in writing of the board's decision.
(7) As used in this section, the following definitions apply:
(a) "Confirmed" means reasonable physical evidence that livestock was actually attacked or killed
by a wolf, mountain lion, black bear, or grizzly bear, including but not limited to the presence of bite marks
indicative of the spacing of tooth punctures of wolves, mountain lions, black bear, or grizzly bears and
associated subcutaneous hemorrhaging and tissue damage indicating that the attack occurred while the animal
was alive, feeding patterns on the carcass, fresh tracks, scat, hair rubbed off on fences or brush, eyewitness
accounts, or other physical evidence that allows a reasonable inference of wolf, mountain lion, black bear, or
grizzly bear predation on an animal that has been largely consumed.
(b) "Fair market value" means:
(i) for commercial sheep more than 1 year old, the average price of sheep of similar age and sex
paid at the most recent Billings livestock sale ring or other ring as determined by the board;
(ii) for commercial lambs, the average market weaning value;
(iii) for registered sheep, twice the average value of commercial sheep of the same age and sex;
(iv) for commercial cattle more than 1 year old, the average price of cattle of similar age and sex
paid at the most recent Billings livestock sale ring or other ring as determined by the board;
(v) for commercial calves, the average market weaning value;
(vi) for registered cattle, twice the average value of commercial cattle of the same age and sex;
(vii) for other registered livestock, twice the average value of commercial-grade animals of the
same breed, age, and sex; or
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 356
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 356
(viii) for other livestock, the average price paid at the most recent public auction for the type of
animal lost or the replacement price as determined by the board.
(c) "Probable" means the presence of some evidence to suggest possible predation but a lack of
sufficient evidence to clearly confirm predation by a particular species. A kill may be classified as probable
depending on factors including but not limited to recent confirmed predation by the suspected depredating
species in the same or a nearby area, recent observation of the livestock by the owner or the owner's
employees, and telemetry monitoring data, sightings, howling, or fresh tracks suggesting that the suspected
depredating species may have been in the area when the depredation occurred."

lands within reservation boundaries are eligible for livestock loss reduction program grants pursuant to 2-15-
