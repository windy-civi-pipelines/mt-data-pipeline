2 indicates otherwise, the following definitions apply:
3 (1) "Automated driving system" means the hardware and software that are collectively capable of

5 system is limited to a specific operational design domain.
6 (2) "Department" means the department of transportation.
7 (3) (a) "Dynamic driving task" means all of the real-time operational and tactical functions required
8 to operate a motor vehicle in highway traffic, including:

10 (ii) longitudinal vehicle motion control through acceleration and deceleration;
11 (iii) monitoring the driving environment through object and event detection, recognition,
12 classification, and response preparation;
13 (iv) object and event response execution;
14 (v) maneuver planning; and
15 (vi) enhancement of the conspicuousness of the vehicle with lights, signals, and gestures.
16 (b) The term does not include strategic functions such as trip scheduling and the selection of
17 destinations and waypoints.
18 (4) "Fallback ready user" means the user of a vehicle equipped with an engaged level 3 automated
19 driving system who is a human driver and who is responsible to operate the vehicle if the automated driving

21 (5) "Level 1 automated driving system" means an automated driving system that provides a driver
22 with one of the following:
23 (a) braking and accelerating support; or
