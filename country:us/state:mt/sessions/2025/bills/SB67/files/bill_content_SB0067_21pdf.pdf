2 (a) has the capability to perform on a sustained basis the entire dynamic driving task within its
3 operational design domain; and
4 (b) requires a fallback ready user to operate the vehicle after the automated driving system issues
5 a request for the fallback ready user to intervene or a system failure occurs.
6 (8) "Level 4 automated driving system" means an automated driving system feature that, without
7 any expectation a human driver will respond to a request to intervene, has the capability to perform:
8 (a) on a sustained basis the entire dynamic driving task within its operational design domain; and
9 (b) any maneuvers necessary to achieve a minimal risk condition in response to:
10 (i) an exit from the operational design domain of the automated driving system; or
11 (ii) a system failure.
12 (9) "Level 5 automated driving system" means an automated driving system feature that, without
13 any expectation a human driver will respond to a request to intervene, has the capability to perform:
14 (a) on a sustained basis the entire dynamic driving task under all conditions that can reasonably
15 be managed by a human driver; and
16 (b) any maneuvers necessary to respond to a system failure.
17 (10) "Operational design domain" means the operating conditions under which an automated driving
18 system or a feature of an automated driving system is specifically designed to function, including:
19 (a) speed-range, environmental, geographical, and time-of-day restrictions; or
