1 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Definitions. As used in [sections 1 through 6], unless the context clearly
2 indicates otherwise, the following definitions apply:
3 (1) "Automated driving system" means the hardware and software that are collectively capable of
4 performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis, regardless of whether the automated driving
5 system is limited to a specific operational design domain.
6 (2) "Department" means the department of transportation.
7 (3) (a) "Dynamic driving task" means all of the real-time operational and tactical functions required
8 to operate a motor vehicle in highway traffic, including:
9 (i) lateral vehicle motion control through steering;
10 (ii) longitudinal vehicle motion control through acceleration and deceleration;
11 (iii) monitoring the driving environment through object and event detection, recognition,
12 classification, and response preparation;
13 (iv) object and event response execution;
14 (v) maneuver planning; and
15 (vi) enhancement of the conspicuousness of the vehicle with lights, signals, and gestures.
16 (b) The term does not include strategic functions such as trip scheduling and the selection of
17 destinations and waypoints.
18 (4) "Fallback ready user" means the user of a vehicle equipped with an engaged level 3 automated
19 driving system who is a human driver and who is responsible to operate the vehicle if the automated driving
20 system issues a request for the user of the vehicle to intervene or a system failure occurs.
21 (5) "Level 1 automated driving system" means an automated driving system that provides a driver
22 with one of the following:
23 (a) braking and accelerating support; or
24 (b) steering support.
25 (6) "Level 2 automated driving system" means an automated driving system that provides a driver

1 (b) steering support.
2 (7) "Level 3 automated driving system" means an automated driving system that:
3 (a) has the capability to perform on a sustained basis the entire dynamic driving task within its
4 operational design domain; and
5 (b) requires a fallback ready user to operate the vehicle after the automated driving system issues
6 a request for the fallback ready user to intervene or a system failure occurs.
7 (8) "Level 4 automated driving system" means an automated driving system feature that, without
8 any expectation a human driver will respond to a request to intervene, has the capability to perform:
9 (a) on a sustained basis the entire dynamic driving task within its operational design domain; and
10 (b) any maneuvers necessary to achieve a minimal risk condition in response to:
11 (i) an exit from the operational design domain of the automated driving system; or
12 (ii) a system failure.
13 (9) "Level 5 automated driving system" means an automated driving system feature that, without
14 any expectation a human driver will respond to a request to intervene, has the capability to perform:
15 (a) on a sustained basis the entire dynamic driving task under all conditions that can reasonably
16 be managed by a human driver; and
17 (b) any maneuvers necessary to respond to a system failure.
18 (10) "Operational design domain" means the operating conditions under which an automated driving
19 system or a feature of an automated driving system is specifically designed to function, including:
20 (a) speed-range, environmental, geographical, and time-of-day restrictions; or
21 (b) the requisite presence or absence of certain traffic or roadway conditions.
22 (11) "Public highways of this state" has the same meaning as provided in 60-1-201.
