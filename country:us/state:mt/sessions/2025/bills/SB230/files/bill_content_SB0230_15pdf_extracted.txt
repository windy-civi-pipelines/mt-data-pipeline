1 attorney general.
2 (c) If the department determines that an investigation and a safety and risk assessment are
3 required, a child protection specialist shall promptly conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances
4 surrounding the allegations of abuse or neglect of the child and perform a safety and risk assessment to
5 determine whether the living arrangement presents an unsafe environment for the child. The safety and risk
6 assessment may include an investigation at the home of the child involved, the child's school or day-care
7 facility, or any other place where the child is present and into all other nonfinancial matters that in the discretion
8 of the investigator are relevant to the safety and risk assessment. In conducting a safety and risk assessment

21 and securing physical evidence and has the right of access to relevant hospital and medical records pertaining
22 to the child. If an interview of the child is considered necessary, the child protection specialist, county attorney,
23 or peace officer may conduct an interview of the child. The interview may be conducted in the presence of the
24 parent or guardian or an employee of the school or day-care facility attended by the child.
25 (4) Subject to 41-3-205(3), if the child's interview is audiotaped or videotaped, an unedited
26 audiotape or videotape with audio track must be made available, upon request, for unencumbered review by
27 the family.

10 assessment determinations and associated records, except for medical records, within 30 days after the end of

16 safety and risk assessment concerning the same person; or
17 (iii) an order has been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction adjudicating the child as a youth
18 in need of care based on the circumstances surrounding the initial allegations.
19 (6) The investigating child protection specialist, within 60 days of commencing an investigation,

22 documenting investigations and safety and risk assessment determinations. Unless records are required to be
23 destroyed under subsections (5)(b) and (5)(c), the department shall retain records relating to the safety and risk
24 assessment, including case notes, correspondence, evaluations, videotapes, and interviews, for 25 years.
25 (7) Any person reporting abuse or neglect that involves acts or omissions on the part of a public or
