6 purposes set forth in this section. Appropriate subfunds must be created to ensure separate tracking of the
7 expenditure of funds from voted and nonvoted levies and transfers for school safety pursuant to 20-9-236.
8 (2) (a) A voted levy may be imposed and a subfund must be created with the approval of the
9 qualified electors of the district for the purpose of raising money for the future construction, equipping, or
10 enlarging of school buildings or for the purpose of purchasing land needed for school purposes in the district. In

26 budgeting and taxation authority of the trustees for a building reserve is computed by dividing the total

2 reserve fund of the district was established. Whenever a subsequent bond issue is made for the same purpose
3 or purposes of a building reserve, the money in the building reserve must be used for the purpose or purposes
4 before any money realized by the bond issue is used.
5 (3) (a) A subfund must be created to account for revenue and expenditures for school major

7 impose a levy of no more than 10 mills on the taxable value of all taxable property within the district for that
8 school fiscal year for the purposes of raising revenue for identified improvements or projects meeting the
9 requirements of 20-9-525(2). The 10-mill limit under this subsection (3) must be calculated using the district's
10 total taxable valuation most recently certified by the department of revenue under 15-10-202. The amount of
11 money raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and
12 anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) may not exceed the district's school major maintenance amount.
13 For the purposes of this section, the term "school major maintenance amount" means the sum of $15,000 and
14 the product of $110 multiplied by the district's budgeted ANB for the prior fiscal year. To authorize and impose a
15 levy under this subsection (3), the trustees shall:

19 deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to
20 20-9-525(3) will be used; and
21 (B) estimating a total dollar amount of money to be raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers
22 authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3), and the
23 resulting estimated number of mills to be levied using the district's taxable valuation most recently certified by
24 the department of revenue under 15-10-202; and
25 (ii) include the amount of any final levy to be imposed as part of its final budget meeting noticed in
26 compliance with 20-9-131.
27 (b) Proceeds from the levy may be expended only for the purposes under 20-9-525(2), and the
28 expenditure of the money must be reported in the annual trustees' report as required by 20-9-213.

1 (c) Whenever the trustees of a district impose a levy pursuant to this subsection (3) during the
2 current school fiscal year, they shall budget for the proceeds of the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized
3 under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) in the district's building
4 reserve fund budget. Any expenditures of the funds must be made in accordance with the financial
5 administration provisions of this title for a budgeted fund.
6 (d) When a tax levy pursuant to this subsection (3) is included as a revenue item on the final
7 building reserve fund budget, the county superintendent shall report the levy requirement to the county
8 commissioners by the later of the first Tuesday in September or within 30 calendar days after receiving certified
9 taxable values and a levy on the district must be made by the county commissioners in accordance with 20-9-
10 142.
11 (e) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for the deposit of proceeds from the
12 levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid
13 pursuant to 20-9-525(3).
14 (f) If the imposition of 10 mills pursuant to subsection (3)(a) is estimated by the trustees to
15 generate an amount less than the maximum levy revenue specified in subsection (3)(a), the trustees may
16 deposit additional funds from any lawfully available revenue source and may transfer additional funds from any
17 lawfully available fund of the district to the subfund provided for in subsection (3)(a), up to the difference
18 between the revenue estimated to be raised by the imposition of 10 mills and the maximum levy revenue
19 specified in subsection (3)(a). The district's local effort for purposes of calculating its eligibility for state school
20 major maintenance aid pursuant to 20-9-525 consists of the combined total of funds raised from the imposition
21 of 10 mills and additional funds raised from deposits and transfers in compliance with this subsection (3)(f).

9 (ii) the proposition must be submitted to the qualified electors in the combined district.
10 (d) The levy for transition costs may not be considered as outstanding indebtedness for the
11 purpose of calculating the limitation in 20-9-406.
12 (5) (a) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for:
13 (i) the funds transferred to the building reserve fund for school safety and security pursuant to 20-

15 (ii) funds generated by a voter-approved levy for school and student safety and security pursuant
16 to subsection (5)(b) of this section.
17 (b) A voted levy may be imposed with the approval of the qualified electors of the district to provide
18 funding for improvements to school and student safety and security that meet any of the criteria set forth in 20-
19 9-236(1)(a) through (1)(e). A voted levy for school and student safety and security may not be considered as
20 outstanding indebtedness for the purpose of calculating the limitation in 20-9-406. The election for a voted levy
21 for school and student safety and security must be conducted in accordance with the school election laws of
