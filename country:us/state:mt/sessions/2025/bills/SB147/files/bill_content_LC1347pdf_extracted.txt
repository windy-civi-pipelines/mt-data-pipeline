17 the following principles:
18 (1) a commitment to cooperation and collaboration;
19 (2) mutual understanding and respect;
20 (3) regular and early communication;
21 (4) a process of accountability for addressing issues; and
22 (5) preservation of the tribal-state relationship;
23 and in possibly no other area of concurrent tribal and state law is it more important that these principles be
24 followed as in an area as socially and culturally determinative as family relationships.

21 (5) On failure, as determined by the clerk of court, of the guardian to file an annual report pursuant

1 legally adopted or appointed a legal guardian.
2 (c) The permanency hearing may be combined with a hearing that is required in other sections of
3 this part or with a review held pursuant to 41-3-115 or 41-3-1010 if held within the applicable time limits. If a
4 permanency hearing is combined with another hearing or a review, the requirements of the court related to the
5 disposition of the other hearing or review must be met in addition to the requirements of this section.
6 (d) The court-approved entity conducting the permanency hearing may elect to hold joint or
7 separate reviews for groups of siblings, but the court shall issue specific findings for each child.
8 (2) At least 3 working days prior to the permanency hearing, the department shall submit a report
9 regarding the child to the entity that will be conducting the hearing for review. The report must address the
10 department's efforts to effectuate the permanency plan for the child, address the options for the child's

17 age-appropriate manner, with the child regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan for the child.

22 hearing.

24 recommendations, the court may adopt the recommendations as findings with no additional hearing required. In
25 this case, the court shall issue written findings within 10 days of receipt of the written recommendations.
26 (6) The court shall approve a specific permanency plan for the child and make written findings on:
27 (a) whether the child has been asked about the desired permanency outcome;

2 individual child;
3 (d) whether the department has made reasonable efforts to finalize the plan;
4 (e) whether there are compelling reasons why it is not in the best interest of the individual child to:
5 (i) return to the child's home; or
6 (ii) be placed for adoption, with a legal guardian, or with a fit and willing relative; and
7 (f) if the case is governed by the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child

11 plan.
12 (7) In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best
13 interests of the child that does not conflict with the options provided in subsection (8) and that does not require
14 an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
15 expenditures are reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
16 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
17 (8) Permanency options include:

19 (b) permanent placement of the child with the noncustodial parent, superseding any existing

23 (e) long-term custody if the child is in a planned permanent living arrangement and if it is
24 established by a preponderance of the evidence, which is reflected in specific findings by the court, that:
25 (i) the child is being cared for by a fit and willing relative;

1 that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;
2 (iv) the child's parent is incarcerated and circumstances, including placement of the child and
3 continued, frequent contact with the parent, indicate that it would not be in the best interests of the child to
4 terminate parental rights of that parent; or
5 (v) the child meets the following criteria:
6 (A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
7 (B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by
8 the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be
9 contrary to the best interests of the child;
10 (C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been
11 considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
12 (D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
13 long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that
14 placement.
15 (9) For a child 14 years of age or older, the permanency plan must:
16 (a) be developed in consultation with the child and in consultation with up to two members of the
17 child's case planning team who are chosen by the child and who are not a foster parent or child protection
18 specialist for the child;
19 (b) identify one person from the case management team, who is selected by the child, to be
20 designated as the child's advisor and advocate for the application of the reasonable and prudent parenting
21 standard; and
22 (c) include services that will be needed to transition the child from foster care to adulthood.
23 (10) A permanency hearing must document the intensive, ongoing, and unsuccessful efforts made
24 by the department to return the child to the child's home or to secure a permanent placement of the child with a
25 relative, legal guardian, or adoptive parent.
26 (11) The court may terminate a planned permanent living arrangement upon petition of the birth
27 parents or the department if the court finds that the circumstances of the child or family have substantially
28 changed and the best interests of the child are no longer being served."

7 (i) the child's parent or parents;
8 (ii) an individual who has custody of the child or with whom the child resides;
9 (iii) any other individual who reasonably may be expected to have information regarding the child's

13 (b) The inquiries required under this subsection (1) must be documented in the record.
14 (2) Preliminary contacts for the purpose of using due diligence to determine a child's possible

16 (3) A court shall ask each participant in an emergency proceeding or voluntary or involuntary child
17 custody proceeding whether the participant knows or has reason to know that the child is an Indian child. The

19 court shall instruct the parties to inform the court if they subsequently receive information that provides reason
20 to know the child is an Indian child.
21 (4) If there is reason to know the child is an Indian child but the court does not have sufficient
22 evidence to determine that the child is or is not an Indian child, the court shall confirm, by way of a report,
23 declaration, or testimony included in the record, that the department or other party used due diligence to identify

15 (a) an Indian child's extended family member;

6 prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family
7 members of an Indian child reside or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and
8 cultural ties.
9 (7) Nothing in this section prevents the department or the court from placing an Indian child with a

17 on the record or in writing and must be based on one or more of the following considerations:
18 (i) the request of one or both of the Indian child's parents on attestation that they have reviewed
19 the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference provided for in subsections (2) and (3);

28 search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference criteria, but no suitable placement

3 parent or extended family resides or with which the Indian child's parent or extended family members maintain
4 social and cultural ties.
5 (d) A placement may not depart from the preferences based solely on the ordinary bonding or
6 attachment that developed from time spent in a nonpreferred placement.
7 (e) A placement may not depart from the preferences based on the socioeconomic status of any
8 placement relative to another placement.
9 (f) The obligation to engage in a diligent search for a preferred placement is ongoing throughout
10 the case and must be documented in the record. The court shall inquire into the efforts to secure a preferred
11 placement at each hearing.

12 Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act provided for in Title 41, chapter 3, part 13, active

15 child;
16 (e) the child has lived with the potential guardian in a family setting and the potential guardian is
17 committed to providing a long-term relationship with the child;
18 (f) if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child

4 defined in the [federal] Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. 1901, et seq., [or 41-3-1303,] the [Indian] child's
5 tribe has received notification from the state of the initiation of the proceedings.
6 (3) The entry of a decree of guardianship pursuant to this section terminates the custody of the
7 department and the involvement of the department with the child and the child's parents except for the
8 department's provision of a financial subsidy, if any, pursuant to subsection (8) (9).
9 (4) (a) A guardian appointed under this section may exercise the powers and has the duties
10 provided in 72-5-231.
11 (b) The court shall require a guardian appointed under this section to report annually on the

16 (i) the Indian child's participation in cultural activities involving or reflective of the Indian child's
17 tribe; and
18 (ii) the date the guardian served the report on the Indian child's tribe. Service on the Indian child's
19 tribe must be made by first-class mail to the person identified in the most current federal register as the
20 designated tribal agent for service of notice for the purposes of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act.
21 (5) On failure, as determined by the clerk of court, of the guardian to file an annual report pursuant
22 to subsection (4), the court shall order the guardian to file the report and give good cause for the guardian's
23 failure to file a timely report.
24 (6) The court may revoke a guardianship ordered pursuant to this section if the court finds, after
25 hearing on a petition for removal of the child's guardian, that continuation of the guardianship is not in the best
26 interests of the child. Notice of hearing on the petition must be provided by the moving party to the child's lawful
27 guardian, the department, any court-appointed guardian ad litem, the child's parent if the rights of the parent

21 (B) no later than 12 months after the initial court finding that the child has been subjected to abuse
22 or neglect or 12 months after the child's first 60 days of removal from the home, whichever comes first.
23 (ii) Within 12 months of a hearing under subsection (1)(a)(i)(B) and every 12 months thereafter
24 until the child is permanently placed in either an adoptive or a guardianship placement, the court or the court-
25 approved entity holding the permanency hearing shall conduct a hearing and the court shall issue a finding as
26 to whether the department has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan for the child.
27 (b) A permanency hearing is not required if the proceeding has been dismissed, the child was not
28 removed from the home, the child has been returned to the child's parent or guardian, or the child has been

1 legally adopted or appointed a legal guardian.
2 (c) The permanency hearing may be combined with a hearing that is required in other sections of
3 this part or with a review held pursuant to 41-3-115 or 41-3-1010 if held within the applicable time limits. If a

5 disposition of the other hearing or review must be met in addition to the requirements of this section.

4 (e) whether there are compelling reasons why it is not in the best interest of the individual child to:
5 (i) return to the child's home; or
6 (ii) be placed for adoption, with a legal guardian, or with a fit and willing relative; and
7 (f) if the case is governed by the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child
8 Welfare Act provided for in Title 41, chapter 3, part 13, whether the department has consulted with the child's
9 tribe regarding permanency and the tribe's position on the proposed permanency plan; and
10 (g) other necessary steps that the department is required to take to effectuate the terms of the
11 plan.
12 (7) In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best
13 interests of the child that does not conflict with the options provided in subsection (8) and that does not require
14 an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
15 expenditures are reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
16 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
17 (8) Permanency options include:
18 (a) reunification of the child with the child's parent or guardian;
19 (b) permanent placement of the child with the noncustodial parent, superseding any existing
20 custodial order;

26 (ii) the child has an emotional or mental handicap that is so severe that the child cannot function in

1 that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;
2 (iv) the child's parent is incarcerated and circumstances, including placement of the child and
3 continued, frequent contact with the parent, indicate that it would not be in the best interests of the child to
4 terminate parental rights of that parent; or
5 (v) the child meets the following criteria:
6 (A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
7 (B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by
8 the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be
9 contrary to the best interests of the child;
10 (C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been
11 considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
12 (D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
13 long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that
14 placement.
15 (9) For a child 14 years of age or older, the permanency plan must:
16 (a) be developed in consultation with the child and in consultation with up to two members of the
17 child's case planning team who are chosen by the child and who are not a foster parent or child protection
18 specialist for the child;
19 (b) identify one person from the case management team, who is selected by the child, to be
20 designated as the child's advisor and advocate for the application of the reasonable and prudent parenting
21 standard; and
22 (c) include services that will be needed to transition the child from foster care to adulthood.
23 (10) A permanency hearing must document the intensive, ongoing, and unsuccessful efforts made
24 by the department to return the child to the child's home or to secure a permanent placement of the child with a
25 relative, legal guardian, or adoptive parent.
26 (11) The court may terminate a planned permanent living arrangement upon petition of the birth
27 parents or the department if the court finds that the circumstances of the child or family have substantially
28 changed and the best interests of the child are no longer being served."

8 (ii) an individual who has custody of the child or with whom the child resides;
9 (iii) any other individual who reasonably may be expected to have information regarding the child's

16 (3) A court shall ask each participant in an emergency proceeding or voluntary or involuntary child
17 custody proceeding whether the participant knows or has reason to know that the child is an Indian child. The
18 inquiry must be made at the commencement of the proceeding and all responses must be on the record. The
19 court shall instruct the parties to inform the court if they subsequently receive information that provides reason
20 to know the child is an Indian child.
21 (4) If there is reason to know the child is an Indian child but the court does not have sufficient
22 evidence to determine that the child is or is not an Indian child, the court shall confirm, by way of a report,
23 declaration, or testimony included in the record, that the department or other party used due diligence to identify
24 and work with all tribes of which there is reason to know the child may be a member or eligible for membership
25 to verify whether the child is a member or eligible for membership.
26 (5) A court, on conducting the inquiry required in subsection (3), has reason to know that a child

15 (h) the court determines from additional information provided that the child may be an Indian child.

17 (7) (a) When seeking verification of a child's Indian status during a voluntary proceeding, the court
18 shall keep relevant documents pertaining to the inquiry confidential and under seal if a consenting parent
19 expresses either orally or in writing a desire for anonymity. A request for anonymity does not relieve the court,
20 agency, or other party from any duty of compliance with this part, including the obligation to verify whether the
21 child is an Indian child.
22 (b) A tribe receiving information related to an inquiry of a child's status as an Indian child must
23 keep documents and information confidential.
24 (7) A written determination by an Indian tribe regarding the child's status as an Indian child is

1 (2) If an Indian child is removed from a foster care placement or a preadoptive or adoptive home
2 for the purposes of further foster care or a preadoptive or adoptive placement, the placement must be made in
3 accordance with this part unless an Indian child is being returned to the parent or Indian custodian from whose
4 custody the child was originally removed. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch. 716, L. 2023.)"

6 Section 13. Section 41-3-1329, MCA, is amended to read:
7 "41-3-1329. (Temporary) Placement preferences. (1) When an emergency removal, foster care
8 placement, or preadoptive placement of an Indian child is necessary, the petitioning party shall, in the absence
9 of good cause to the contrary, place the Indian child in the least restrictive setting that:
10 (a) most closely approximates a family situation;
11 (b) is in reasonable proximity to the Indian child's home; and
12 (c) allows for the Indian child's special needs, if any, to be met.
13 (2) In a foster care or preadoptive placement, preference must be given, in the absence of good
14 cause to the contrary, to the Indian child's placement with one of the following, in descending order of priority:
15 (a) an Indian child's extended family member;
16 (b) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child's tribe;
17 (c) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing authority; or
18 (d) an institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization that
19 has a program suitable to meet the Indian child's needs.
20 (3) In the absence of good cause to the contrary, in an adoptive or other permanent placement of
21 an Indian child, preference must be given to a placement with one of the following, in descending order of
22 priority:
23 (a) extended family members;
24 (b) an Indian family of the same tribe as the Indian child;
25 (c) another Indian family.
26 (4) Notwithstanding the placement preferences listed in subsections (2) and (3), if a different order
27 of placement preference is established by the Indian child's tribe, the court or agency implementing the
28 placement shall follow the order of preference established by the tribe if the placement is in the least restrictive

1 setting appropriate to the particular needs of the Indian child and within reasonable proximity to the child's
2 home.
3 (5) When appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or the child's parent must be considered
4 by the court.
5 (6) The standards to be applied in meeting the preference requirements of this section must be the
6 prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family
7 members of an Indian child reside or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and
8 cultural ties.
9 (7) Nothing in this section prevents the department or the court from placing an Indian child with a
10 parent to effectuate a permanency plan regardless of the parent's relationship to the Indian child's tribe.
11 (8) (a) If any party asserts that good cause to not follow the placement preferences exists, the
12 reasons for that belief or assertion must be stated orally on the record or provided in writing to the parties to the
13 child custody proceeding and the court.
14 (b) The party seeking departure from the placement preferences bears the burden of proving by
15 clear and convincing evidence that there is good cause to depart from the placement preferences.
16 (c) A court's determination of good cause to depart from the placement preferences must be made
17 on the record or in writing and must be based on one or more of the following considerations:
18 (i) the request of one or both of the Indian child's parents on attestation that they have reviewed
19 the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference provided for in subsections (2) and (3);
20 (ii) the request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the decision
21 that is being made;
22 (iii) the presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular
23 placement;
24 (iv) the extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, including but not
25 limited to specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where families who meet the
26 placement preferences live; or
27 (v) the unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a diligent
28 search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference criteria, but no suitable placement

1 was found. For the purposes of this analysis, the standards for determining whether a placement is unavailable
2 must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the Indian child's
3 parent or extended family resides or with which the Indian child's parent or extended family members maintain
4 social and cultural ties.
5 (d) A placement may not depart from the preferences based solely on the ordinary bonding or
6 attachment that developed from time spent in a nonpreferred placement.
7 (e) A placement may not depart from the preferences based on the socioeconomic status of any
8 placement relative to another placement.
9 (f) The obligation to engage in a diligent search for a preferred placement is ongoing throughout
10 the case and must be documented in the record. The court shall inquire into the efforts to secure a preferred
11 placement at each hearing.
12 (9) If an Indian child is in a foster care placement that is not a preferred placement, the court shall
13 hold a status hearing no less than every 30 days to review the department's efforts to place a child in a
14 preferred placement consistent with this section.
15 (10) Except in an emergency removal, in the event the department intends to change the placement
16 of the child and the change in placement does not involve reunification of the child with a natural parent or
17 Indian custodian, the department shall, at least 2 business days prior to the change in placement, provide
18 written notice of the change to the child's tribe, parents, Indian custodian, guardian ad litem, and counsel for the
19 child, parents, Indian custodian, and tribe. The notice must provide the date the placement change is to occur
20 and the reason for the placement change. If the child's tribe or a party objects, the child's tribe or counsel for
21 the party shall notify the court and other parties. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch. 716, L. 2023.)"
