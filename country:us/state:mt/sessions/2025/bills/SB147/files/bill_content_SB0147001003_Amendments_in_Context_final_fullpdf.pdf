6 (f)(g) other necessary steps that the department is required to take to effectuate the terms of the
7 plan.
8 (7) In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best
9 interests of the child that does not conflict with the options provided in subsection (8) and that does not require
10 an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
11 expenditures are reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
12 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
13 (8) Permanency options include:
14 (a) reunification of the child with the child's parent or guardian;

21 (i) the child is being cared for by a fit and willing relative;
22 (ii) the child has an emotional or mental handicap that is so severe that the child cannot function in
23 a family setting and the best interests of the child are served by placement in a residential or group setting;
24 (iii) the child is at least 16 years of age and is participating in an independent living program and
25 that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;

2 (v) the child meets the following criteria:
3 (A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
4 (B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by
5 the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be
6 contrary to the best interests of the child;
7 (C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been
8 considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
9 (D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
10 long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that
11 placement.

13 (a) be developed in consultation with the child and in consultation with up to two members of the
14 child's case planning team who are chosen by the child and who are not a foster parent or child protection
15 specialist for the child;
16 (b) identify one person from the case management team, who is selected by the child, to be
17 designated as the child's advisor and advocate for the application of the reasonable and prudent parenting
18 standard; and
19 (c) include services that will be needed to transition the child from foster care to adulthood.
20 (10) A permanency hearing must document the intensive, ongoing, and unsuccessful efforts made
21 by the department to return the child to the child's home or to secure a permanent placement of the child with a
22 relative, legal guardian, or adoptive parent.
23 (11) The court may terminate a planned permanent living arrangement upon petition of the birth
24 parents or the department if the court finds that the circumstances of the child or family have substantially
25 changed and the best interests of the child are no longer being served."

13 exclusive jurisdiction over child custody matters, a statement of the efforts made and being made to contact the
14 tribe and transfer the child to the tribe's jurisdiction; and
15 (j) a statement of the efforts made to assist the parents or Indian custodians so the Indian child
16 may be safely returned to the parents or Indian custodians.
17 (6) Contact made to provide notice of an emergency removal and reported pursuant to subsection
18 (5)(c) does not constitute the notice required under 41-3-1311 for the purposes of subsequent dependency,
19 termination of parental rights, or adoption proceedings.
20 (7) An emergency proceeding regarding an Indian child may not be continued for more than 30
21 days unless the court determines that:
22 (a) restoring the child to the parent or Indian custodian would subject the child to imminent physical
23 damage or harm;
24 (b) the court has been unable to transfer the proceeding to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian
25 tribe; and
26 (c) it has not been possible to initiate a child custody proceeding. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec.

2 Section 11. Section 41-3-1328, MCA, is amended to read:
3 "41-3-1328. (Temporary) Removal of Indian child from adoptive or foster care placement. (1) If a
4 final decree of adoption of an Indian child has been vacated or set aside or the adoptive parents voluntarily
5 consent to the termination of their parental rights to the Indian child, the department shall make diligent efforts
6 to contact the child's tribe. The biological parent or prior Indian custodian may petition to have the Indian child
7 returned to the custody of the parent or Indian custodian. The court shall grant the request unless there is a
8 showing by clear and convincing evidence that return of custody to the biological parent or Indian custodian is
9 not in the best interests of the child.
10 (2) If a final decree of adoption of an Indian child has been vacated or set aside, or the adoptive
11 parents voluntarily consent to the termination of the adoptive parents' parental rights to the Indian child, the
12 petitioning party shall provide notice in accordance with 41-3-1311 to:
13 (a) the Indian child's parent or Indian custodian; and
14 (b) the Indian child's tribe or tribes.
15 (2)(3) If an Indian child is removed from a foster care placement or a preadoptive or adoptive home
16 for the purposes of further foster care or a preadoptive or adoptive placement, the placement must be made in
17 accordance with this part unless an Indian child is being returned to the parent or Indian custodian from whose
18 custody the child was originally removed. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch. 716, L. 2023.)"

20 Section 12. Section 41-3-1329, MCA, is amended to read:
21 "41-3-1329. (Temporary) Placement preferences. (1) When an emergency removal, foster care
22 placement, or preadoptive placement of an Indian child is necessary, the petitioning party shall, in the absence
23 of good cause to the contrary, place the Indian child in the least restrictive setting that:
24 (a) most closely approximates a family situation;
25 (b) is in reasonable proximity to the Indian child's home; and
26 (c) allows for the Indian child's special needs, if any, to be met.
27 (2) In a foster care or preadoptive placement, preference must be given, in the absence of good

1 cause to the contrary, to the Indian child's placement with one of the following, in descending order of priority:
2 (a) an Indian child's extended family member;
3 (b) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child's tribe;
4 (c) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing authority; or
5 (d) an institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization that
6 has a program suitable to meet the Indian child's needs.
7 (3) In the absence of good cause to the contrary, in an adoptive or other permanent placement of
8 an Indian child, preference must be given to a placement with one of the following, in descending order of
9 priority:
10 (a) extended family members;
11 (b) an Indian family of the same tribe as the Indian child;
12 (c) another Indian family.
13 (4) Notwithstanding the placement preferences listed in subsections (2) and (3), if a different order
14 of placement preference is established by the Indian child's tribe, the court or agency implementing the
15 placement shall follow the order of preference established by the tribe if the placement is in the least restrictive
16 setting appropriate to the particular needs of the Indian child and within reasonable proximity to the child's
17 home.
18 (5) When appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or the child's parent must be considered
19 by the court.
20 (6) The standards to be applied in meeting the preference requirements of this section must be the
21 prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family
22 members of an Indian child reside or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and
23 cultural ties.
24 (7) Nothing in this section prevents the department or the court from placing an Indian child with a
25 parent to effectuate a permanency plan regardless of the parent's relationship to the Indian child's tribe.
26 (8) (a) If any party asserts that good cause to not follow the placement preferences exists, the
27 reasons for that belief or assertion must be stated orally on the record or provided in writing to the parties to the

1 child custody proceeding and the court.
2 (b) The party seeking departure from the placement preferences bears the burden of proving by
3 clear and convincing evidence that there is good cause to depart from the placement preferences.
4 (c) A court's determination of good cause to depart from the placement preferences must be made
5 on the record or in writing and must be based on one or more of the following considerations:
6 (i) the request of one or both of the Indian child's parents on attestation that they have reviewed
7 the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference provided for in subsections (2) and (3);
8 (ii) the request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the decision
9 that is being made;
10 (iii) the presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular
11 placement;
12 (iv) the extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, including but not
13 limited to specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where families who meet the
14 placement preferences live; or
15 (v) the unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a diligent
16 search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference criteria, but no suitable placement
17 was found. For the purposes of this analysis, the standards for determining whether a placement is unavailable
18 must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the Indian child's
19 parent or extended family resides or with which the Indian child's parent or extended family members maintain
20 social and cultural ties.
21 (d) A placement may not depart from the preferences based solely on the ordinary bonding or
22 attachment that developed from time spent in a nonpreferred placement.
23 (d)(e) A placement may not depart from the preferences based on the socioeconomic status of any
24 placement relative to another placement.
25 (f) The obligation to engage in a diligent search for a preferred placement is ongoing throughout
26 the case and must be documented in the record. The court shall inquire into the efforts to secure a preferred
27 placement at each hearing.

2 hold a status hearing no less than every 30 60 days to review the department's efforts to place a child in a

4 (10) Except in an emergency removal necessitating a change in placement, in the event the
5 department intends to change the placement of the child and the change in placement does not involve
6 reunification of the child with a natural parent or Indian custodian, the department shall, at least 2 business
7 days prior to the change in placement, provide written notice of the change to the child's tribe, parents, Indian
8 custodian, guardian ad litem, and counsel for the child, parents, Indian custodian, and tribe. The notice must
9 provide the date the placement change is to occur and the reason for the placement change. If the child's tribe
