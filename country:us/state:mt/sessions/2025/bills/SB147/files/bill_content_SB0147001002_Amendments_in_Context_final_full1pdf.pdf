11 the discretion of the Indian child's tribe, that documents the parties' agreement regarding how the Indian child
12 will continue to actively participate in the Indian child's cultural learning and activities and engagement with
13 family members.
14 (2) Each cultural compact must be specific to the Indian child and must articulate the Indian child's
15 understanding as the Indian child grows and matures.

17 (a) become part of the court record;

17 tribe has received notification from the state of the initiation of the proceedings.
18 (3) The entry of a decree of guardianship pursuant to this section terminates the custody of the

17 that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;

11 (b) is in reasonable proximity to the Indian child's home; and
12 (c) allows for the Indian child's special needs, if any, to be met.
13 (2) In a foster care or preadoptive placement, preference must be given, in the absence of good
14 cause to the contrary, to the Indian child's placement with one of the following, in descending order of priority:
15 (a) an Indian child's extended family member;
16 (b) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child's tribe;
17 (c) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing authority; or
18 (d) an institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization that
19 has a program suitable to meet the Indian child's needs.
20 (3) In the absence of good cause to the contrary, in an adoptive or other permanent placement of
21 an Indian child, preference must be given to a placement with one of the following, in descending order of
22 priority:
23 (a) extended family members;
24 (b) an Indian family of the same tribe as the Indian child;
25 (c) another Indian family.
26 (4) Notwithstanding the placement preferences listed in subsections (2) and (3), if a different order
27 of placement preference is established by the Indian child's tribe, the court or agency implementing the

1 placement shall follow the order of preference established by the tribe if the placement is in the least restrictive
2 setting appropriate to the particular needs of the Indian child and within reasonable proximity to the child's
3 home.
4 (5) When appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or the child's parent must be considered
5 by the court.
6 (6) The standards to be applied in meeting the preference requirements of this section must be the
7 prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family
8 members of an Indian child reside or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and
9 cultural ties.
10 (7) Nothing in this section prevents the department or the court from placing an Indian child with a
11 parent to effectuate a permanency plan regardless of the parent's relationship to the Indian child's tribe.
12 (8) (a) If any party asserts that good cause to not follow the placement preferences exists, the
13 reasons for that belief or assertion must be stated orally on the record or provided in writing to the parties to the
14 child custody proceeding and the court.
15 (b) The party seeking departure from the placement preferences bears the burden of proving by
16 clear and convincing evidence that there is good cause to depart from the placement preferences.
17 (c) A court's determination of good cause to depart from the placement preferences must be made
18 on the record or in writing and must be based on one or more of the following considerations:
19 (i) the request of one or both of the Indian child's parents on attestation that they have reviewed
20 the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference provided for in subsections (2) and (3);
21 (ii) the request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the decision
22 that is being made;
23 (iii) the presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular
24 placement;
25 (iv) the extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, including but not
26 limited to specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where families who meet the
27 placement preferences live; or

1 (v) the unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a diligent
2 search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference criteria, but no suitable placement
3 was found. For the purposes of this analysis, the standards for determining whether a placement is unavailable
4 must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the Indian child's
5 parent or extended family resides or with which the Indian child's parent or extended family members maintain
6 social and cultural ties.
7 (d) A placement may not depart from the preferences based solely on the ordinary bonding or
8 attachment that developed from time spent in a nonpreferred placement.
9 (d)(e) A placement may not depart from the preferences based on the socioeconomic status of any
10 placement relative to another placement.
11 (f) The obligation to engage in a diligent search for a preferred placement is ongoing throughout
12 the case and must be documented in the record. The court shall inquire into the efforts to secure a preferred
13 placement at each hearing.
14 (9) If an Indian child is in a foster care placement that is not a preferred placement, the court shall
15 hold a status hearing no less than every 30 days to review the department's efforts to place a child in a
16 preferred placement consistent with this section.
17 (10) Except in an emergency removal, in the event the department intends to change the placement
18 of the child and the change in placement does not involve reunification of the child with a natural parent or
19 Indian custodian, the department shall, at least 2 business days prior to the change in placement, provide
20 written notice of the change to the child's tribe, parents, Indian custodian, guardian ad litem, and counsel for the
21 child, parents, Indian custodian, and tribe. The notice must provide the date the placement change is to occur
22 and the reason for the placement change. If the child's tribe or a party objects, the child's tribe or counsel for
23 the party shall notify the court and other parties. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch. 716, L. 2023.)"
