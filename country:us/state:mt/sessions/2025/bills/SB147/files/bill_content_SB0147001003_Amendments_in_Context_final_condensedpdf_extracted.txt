5 (i) the child's parent or parents;
6 (ii) an individual who has custody of the child or with whom the child resides;
7 (iii) any other individual who reasonably may be expected to have information regarding the child's
8 possible membership or eligibility for membership in an Indian tribe; and
9 (iv) any Indian tribe of which the child may be a member or may be eligible for membership. The
10 consultation with a tribe must be made by contacting the tribe in writing.
11 (b) The inquiries required under this subsection (1) must be documented in the record.
12 (2) Preliminary contacts for the purpose of using due diligence to determine a child's possible
13 Indian status do not constitute legal notice as required by 41-3-1311.
14 (3) A court shall ask each participant in an emergency proceeding or voluntary or involuntary child
15 custody proceeding whether the participant knows or has reason to know that the child is an Indian child. The
16 inquiry must be made at the commencement of the proceeding and all responses must be on the record. The
17 court shall instruct the parties to inform the court if they subsequently receive information that provides reason
18 to know the child is an Indian child.
19 (4) If there is reason to know the child is an Indian child but the court does not have sufficient
20 evidence to determine that the child is or is not an Indian child, the court shall confirm, by way of a report,
21 declaration, or testimony included in the record, that the department or other party used due diligence to identify
22 and work with all tribes of which there is reason to know the child may be a member or eligible for membership
23 to verify whether the child is a member or eligible for membership.
24 (5) A court, on conducting the inquiry required in subsection (3), has reason to know that a child
25 involved in an emergency proceeding or child custody proceeding may be an Indian child if:
26 (a) any participant in the proceeding, officer of the court involved in the proceeding, Indian tribe,
27 Indian organization, or agency informs the court that:

9 indicating membership in an Indian tribe; or
10 (f) the court determines from additional information provided that the child may be an Indian child.;
11 or
12 (g) the parent, guardian, Indian custodian, or child indicate they receive health care from the Indian
13 health services or an urban Indian health clinic; or
14 (h) the court determines from additional information provided that the child may be an Indian child.
15 (6) The court may not rely on prior determinations from past child custody proceedings.
16 (6)(7) (a) When seeking verification of a child's Indian status during a voluntary proceeding, the court
17 shall keep relevant documents pertaining to the inquiry confidential and under seal if a consenting parent
18 expresses either orally or in writing a desire for anonymity. A request for anonymity does not relieve the court,
19 agency, or other party from any duty of compliance with this part, including the obligation to verify whether the
20 child is an Indian child.
21 (b) A tribe receiving information related to an inquiry of a child's status as an Indian child must
22 keep documents and information confidential.
23 (7)(8) A written determination by an Indian tribe regarding the child's status as an Indian child is
24 conclusive that the child is an Indian child. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch. 716, L. 2023.)"

4 U.S.C. 1919;
5 (b) the tribe has expressly declined to exercise its exclusive jurisdiction; or
6 (c) the state is exercising emergency jurisdiction in compliance with 41-3-1325.

9 (3) Except as provided in subsection (5), in a child custody proceeding involving an Indian child
10 who is not residing or domiciled within the reservation of the Indian child's tribe, the court shall, in the absence
11 of good cause to the contrary, transfer the proceeding to the jurisdiction of the Indian child's tribe on the motion
12 of any of the following:
13 (a) either of the Indian child's parents;
14 (b) the Indian child's Indian custodian; or
15 (c) the Indian child's tribe.

18 (5) If either of the Indian child's parents objects to transfer of the proceeding to the Indian child's
19 tribe, the court may not transfer the proceeding.
20 (6) (a) If a state court believes or any party asserts that good cause to deny transfer exists, the
21 reasons for that belief or assertion must be provided orally or in writing on the record and to the parties to the
22 child custody proceeding. Any party to the child custody proceeding must have the opportunity to provide the
23 court with the reasons that good cause exists to deny transfer of the proceeding.
24 (b) In determining whether good cause exists, the court may not consider:
25 (i) whether the child custody proceeding is at an advanced stage;
26 (ii) whether there have been prior proceedings involving the child for which no petition to transfer
27 was filed;

1 (iii) whether transfer could affect the placement of the child;
2 (iv) the child's cultural connections with the tribe or its reservation; or
3 (v) socioeconomic conditions or any negative perception of the tribal or bureau of Indian affairs
4 social services or judicial systems.
5 (c) If the court denies transfer of jurisdiction, the court shall state its reasons for the denial orally on
6 the record or in a written order.
7 (7) (a) Following entry of an order transferring jurisdiction to the Indian child's tribe and pending
8 receipt of a tribal court order accepting jurisdiction, the state court:
9 (i) may conduct additional hearings and enter orders that are in the best interests of the child and
10 strictly comply with the requirements of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act and this part; and
11 (ii) may not enter a final order in a child custody proceeding, except an order dismissing the
12 proceeding and returning the Indian child to the care of the parent or Indian custodian from whose care the
13 child was removed.
14 (b) On receipt of an order from a tribal court accepting jurisdiction, the court shall:
15 (i) dismiss the child custody proceeding with prejudice; and
16 (ii) expeditiously provide the tribal court with all records related to the proceeding, including but not
17 limited to the pleadings and any court record. The state court shall work with the tribal court to ensure the
18 transfer of the custody of the Indian child and the proceeding is accomplished smoothly and in a way that
19 minimizes the disruption of services to the family.
20 (8) If the Indian child's tribe accepts jurisdiction, the state court shall enter an order relieving the
21 office of the state public defender and any public defender assigned pursuant to 41-3-425 and 47-1-104 from
22 further representation.
23 (9) If the Indian child's tribe declines jurisdiction, the state court shall enter an order vacating the
24 order vacating the order transferring jurisdiction and proceed with adjudication of the child custody proceeding
25 in compliance with the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, this part, and any applicable state-tribal agreement.

3 expert witness is an individual who provides testimony in a child custody proceeding under this part. The

9 so stipulated on the record and the court is satisfied that stipulation is made knowingly, intelligently, and
10 voluntarily.
11 (2)(3) The petitioning party shall consult with the Indian child's tribe on the selection of the qualified
12 expert witness, including asking whether the tribe has a list of preferred qualified expert witnesses. To the
13 extent possible, the petitioning party shall use an individual preferred by the tribe. The petitioner shall file a
14 declaration with the court describing the efforts the petitioner made under this subsection to identity identify a
15 qualified expert witness.
16 (3)(4) A qualified expert witness must be qualified to testify regarding whether the child's continued
17 custody by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child
18 and must be qualified to testify as to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian child's tribe.
19 (4)(5) (a) If the petitioner is the department, the child protection specialist assigned to the case and

23 expert witness for other purposes in a proceeding under this part; or
24 (ii) the petitioner or another party in a proceeding under this part from providing additional
25 witnesses or expert testimony, subject to the approval of the court, on any issue before the court, including the

8 "41-3-1319. (Temporary) Active efforts. (1) Any party seeking to effect affect a foster care
9 placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under state law shall satisfy the court that
10 active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the
11 breakup of the Indian family and that the efforts have proven unsuccessful. The party seeking to affect a foster
12 care placement shall demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it has engaged in active efforts to
13 prevent the breakup of the Indian family. The party seeking to terminate parental rights shall demonstrate by
14 proof beyond a reasonable doubt that it has engaged in active efforts to prevent the breakup of the Indian
15 family.
16 (2) The court shall make written findings that the petitioning party has provided active efforts and
17 the efforts must be documented in detail in the record.

3 "41-3-1328. (Temporary) Removal of Indian child from adoptive or foster care placement. (1) If a
4 final decree of adoption of an Indian child has been vacated or set aside or the adoptive parents voluntarily
5 consent to the termination of their parental rights to the Indian child, the department shall make diligent efforts
6 to contact the child's tribe. The biological parent or prior Indian custodian may petition to have the Indian child
7 returned to the custody of the parent or Indian custodian. The court shall grant the request unless there is a
8 showing by clear and convincing evidence that return of custody to the biological parent or Indian custodian is
9 not in the best interests of the child.
10 (2) If a final decree of adoption of an Indian child has been vacated or set aside, or the adoptive
11 parents voluntarily consent to the termination of the adoptive parents' parental rights to the Indian child, the
12 petitioning party shall provide notice in accordance with 41-3-1311 to:

23 of good cause to the contrary, place the Indian child in the least restrictive setting that:
24 (a) most closely approximates a family situation;
25 (b) is in reasonable proximity to the Indian child's home; and

1 cause to the contrary, to the Indian child's placement with one of the following, in descending order of priority:
2 (a) an Indian child's extended family member;
3 (b) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child's tribe;
4 (c) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing authority; or
5 (d) an institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization that
6 has a program suitable to meet the Indian child's needs.
7 (3) In the absence of good cause to the contrary, in an adoptive or other permanent placement of
8 an Indian child, preference must be given to a placement with one of the following, in descending order of
9 priority:
10 (a) extended family members;
11 (b) an Indian family of the same tribe as the Indian child;
12 (c) another Indian family.
13 (4) Notwithstanding the placement preferences listed in subsections (2) and (3), if a different order
14 of placement preference is established by the Indian child's tribe, the court or agency implementing the
15 placement shall follow the order of preference established by the tribe if the placement is in the least restrictive
16 setting appropriate to the particular needs of the Indian child and within reasonable proximity to the child's
17 home.
18 (5) When appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or the child's parent must be considered
19 by the court.
20 (6) The standards to be applied in meeting the preference requirements of this section must be the
21 prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family
22 members of an Indian child reside or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and
23 cultural ties.
24 (7) Nothing in this section prevents the department or the court from placing an Indian child with a
25 parent to effectuate a permanency plan regardless of the parent's relationship to the Indian child's tribe.
26 (8) (a) If any party asserts that good cause to not follow the placement preferences exists, the
27 reasons for that belief or assertion must be stated orally on the record or provided in writing to the parties to the

1 child custody proceeding and the court.
2 (b) The party seeking departure from the placement preferences bears the burden of proving by
3 clear and convincing evidence that there is good cause to depart from the placement preferences.
4 (c) A court's determination of good cause to depart from the placement preferences must be made
5 on the record or in writing and must be based on one or more of the following considerations:
6 (i) the request of one or both of the Indian child's parents on attestation that they have reviewed
7 the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference provided for in subsections (2) and (3);
8 (ii) the request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the decision
9 that is being made;
10 (iii) the presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular
11 placement;
12 (iv) the extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, including but not
13 limited to specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where families who meet the
14 placement preferences live; or
15 (v) the unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a diligent
16 search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference criteria, but no suitable placement
17 was found. For the purposes of this analysis, the standards for determining whether a placement is unavailable
18 must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the Indian child's
19 parent or extended family resides or with which the Indian child's parent or extended family members maintain
20 social and cultural ties.
21 (d) A placement may not depart from the preferences based solely on the ordinary bonding or
22 attachment that developed from time spent in a nonpreferred placement.
23 (d)(e) A placement may not depart from the preferences based on the socioeconomic status of any
24 placement relative to another placement.
25 (f) The obligation to engage in a diligent search for a preferred placement is ongoing throughout
26 the case and must be documented in the record. The court shall inquire into the efforts to secure a preferred
27 placement at each hearing.

2 hold a status hearing no less than every 30 60 days to review the department's efforts to place a child in a
3 preferred placement consistent with this section.
4 (10) Except in an emergency removal necessitating a change in placement, in the event the
5 department intends to change the placement of the child and the change in placement does not involve
6 reunification of the child with a natural parent or Indian custodian, the department shall, at least 2 business
7 days prior to the change in placement, provide written notice of the change to the child's tribe, parents, Indian
8 custodian, guardian ad litem, and counsel for the child, parents, Indian custodian, and tribe. The notice must

18 transfer of the custody of the Indian child and the proceeding is accomplished smoothly and in a way that
19 minimizes the disruption of services to the family.
20 (8) If the Indian child's tribe accepts jurisdiction, the state court shall enter an order relieving the
21 office of the state public defender and any public defender assigned pursuant to 41-3-425 and 47-1-104 from
22 further representation.
23 (9) If the Indian child's tribe declines jurisdiction, the state court shall enter an order vacating the
24 order vacating the order transferring jurisdiction and proceed with adjudication of the child custody proceeding
25 in compliance with the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, this part, and any applicable state-tribal agreement.

9 so stipulated on the record and the court is satisfied that stipulation is made knowingly, intelligently, and
10 voluntarily.
11 (2)(3) The petitioning party shall consult with the Indian child's tribe on the selection of the qualified
12 expert witness, including asking whether the tribe has a list of preferred qualified expert witnesses. To the
13 extent possible, the petitioning party shall use an individual preferred by the tribe. The petitioner shall file a
14 declaration with the court describing the efforts the petitioner made under this subsection to identity identify a
15 qualified expert witness.

9 placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under state law shall satisfy the court that
10 active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the
11 breakup of the Indian family and that the efforts have proven unsuccessful. The party seeking to affect a foster
12 care placement shall demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it has engaged in active efforts to
13 prevent the breakup of the Indian family. The party seeking to terminate parental rights shall demonstrate by
14 proof beyond a reasonable doubt that it has engaged in active efforts to prevent the breakup of the Indian

3 "41-3-1328. (Temporary) Removal of Indian child from adoptive or foster care placement. (1) If a
4 final decree of adoption of an Indian child has been vacated or set aside or the adoptive parents voluntarily
5 consent to the termination of their parental rights to the Indian child, the department shall make diligent efforts
6 to contact the child's tribe. The biological parent or prior Indian custodian may petition to have the Indian child
7 returned to the custody of the parent or Indian custodian. The court shall grant the request unless there is a
8 showing by clear and convincing evidence that return of custody to the biological parent or Indian custodian is
9 not in the best interests of the child.
10 (2) If a final decree of adoption of an Indian child has been vacated or set aside, or the adoptive
11 parents voluntarily consent to the termination of the adoptive parents' parental rights to the Indian child, the
12 petitioning party shall provide notice in accordance with 41-3-1311 to:

1 cause to the contrary, to the Indian child's placement with one of the following, in descending order of priority:
2 (a) an Indian child's extended family member;
3 (b) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child's tribe;
4 (c) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing authority; or
5 (d) an institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization that
6 has a program suitable to meet the Indian child's needs.
7 (3) In the absence of good cause to the contrary, in an adoptive or other permanent placement of
8 an Indian child, preference must be given to a placement with one of the following, in descending order of
9 priority:
10 (a) extended family members;
11 (b) an Indian family of the same tribe as the Indian child;
12 (c) another Indian family.
13 (4) Notwithstanding the placement preferences listed in subsections (2) and (3), if a different order
14 of placement preference is established by the Indian child's tribe, the court or agency implementing the
15 placement shall follow the order of preference established by the tribe if the placement is in the least restrictive
16 setting appropriate to the particular needs of the Indian child and within reasonable proximity to the child's
17 home.
18 (5) When appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or the child's parent must be considered
19 by the court.
20 (6) The standards to be applied in meeting the preference requirements of this section must be the
21 prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family
22 members of an Indian child reside or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and
23 cultural ties.
24 (7) Nothing in this section prevents the department or the court from placing an Indian child with a
25 parent to effectuate a permanency plan regardless of the parent's relationship to the Indian child's tribe.
26 (8) (a) If any party asserts that good cause to not follow the placement preferences exists, the
27 reasons for that belief or assertion must be stated orally on the record or provided in writing to the parties to the

1 child custody proceeding and the court.
2 (b) The party seeking departure from the placement preferences bears the burden of proving by
3 clear and convincing evidence that there is good cause to depart from the placement preferences.
4 (c) A court's determination of good cause to depart from the placement preferences must be made
5 on the record or in writing and must be based on one or more of the following considerations:
6 (i) the request of one or both of the Indian child's parents on attestation that they have reviewed
7 the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference provided for in subsections (2) and (3);
8 (ii) the request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the decision
9 that is being made;
10 (iii) the presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular
11 placement;
12 (iv) the extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, including but not
13 limited to specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where families who meet the
14 placement preferences live; or
15 (v) the unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a diligent
16 search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference criteria, but no suitable placement
17 was found. For the purposes of this analysis, the standards for determining whether a placement is unavailable
18 must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the Indian child's
19 parent or extended family resides or with which the Indian child's parent or extended family members maintain
20 social and cultural ties.
21 (d) A placement may not depart from the preferences based solely on the ordinary bonding or
22 attachment that developed from time spent in a nonpreferred placement.
23 (d)(e) A placement may not depart from the preferences based on the socioeconomic status of any
24 placement relative to another placement.
25 (f) The obligation to engage in a diligent search for a preferred placement is ongoing throughout
26 the case and must be documented in the record. The court shall inquire into the efforts to secure a preferred
27 placement at each hearing.

4 (10) Except in an emergency removal necessitating a change in placement, in the event the

6 reunification of the child with a natural parent or Indian custodian, the department shall, at least 2 business
7 days prior to the change in placement, provide written notice of the change to the child's tribe, parents, Indian
