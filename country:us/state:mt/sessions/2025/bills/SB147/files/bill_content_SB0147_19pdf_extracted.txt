20 an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the

12 (A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
13 (B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by

17 considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
18 (D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
19 long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that
20 placement.

20 (a) an Indian child's extended family member;

5 placement shall follow the order of preference established by the tribe if the placement is in the least restrictive
6 setting appropriate to the particular needs of the Indian child and within reasonable proximity to the child's
7 home.
8 (5) When appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or the child's parent must be considered
9 by the court.

11 prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family
12 members of an Indian child reside or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and
13 cultural ties.

24 the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference provided for in subsections (2) and (3);

5 search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference criteria, but no suitable placement
6 was found. For the purposes of this analysis, the standards for determining whether a placement is unavailable
7 must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the Indian child's
8 parent or extended family resides or with which the Indian child's parent or extended family members maintain
9 social and cultural ties.

21 of the child and the change in placement does not involve reunification of the child with a natural parent or
22 Indian custodian, the department shall, at least 2 business days prior to the change in placement, provide
23 written notice of the change to the child's tribe, parents, Indian custodian, guardian ad litem, and counsel for the

18 (7) In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best

20 an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
21 expenditures are reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last

10 terminate parental rights of that parent; or
11 (v) the child meets the following criteria:
12 (A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
13 (B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by

15 contrary to the best interests of the child;
16 (C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been
17 considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
18 (D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
19 long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that

69th Legislature 2025 SB 147.1
1 consent to the termination of their parental rights to the Indian child, the department shall make diligent efforts
2 to contact the child's tribe. The biological parent or prior Indian custodian may petition to have the Indian child
3 returned to the custody of the parent or Indian custodian. The court shall grant the request unless there is a
4 showing by clear and convincing evidence that return of custody to the biological parent or Indian custodian is
5 not in the best interests of the child.
6 (2) If an Indian child is removed from a foster care placement or a preadoptive or adoptive home
7 for the purposes of further foster care or a preadoptive or adoptive placement, the placement must be made in
8 accordance with this part unless an Indian child is being returned to the parent or Indian custodian from whose
9 custody the child was originally removed. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch. 716, L. 2023.)"

11 Section 13. Section 41-3-1329, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "41-3-1329. (Temporary) Placement preferences. (1) When an emergency removal, foster care
13 placement, or preadoptive placement of an Indian child is necessary, the petitioning party shall, in the absence
14 of good cause to the contrary, place the Indian child in the least restrictive setting that:
15 (a) most closely approximates a family situation;
16 (b) is in reasonable proximity to the Indian child's home; and
17 (c) allows for the Indian child's special needs, if any, to be met.
18 (2) In a foster care or preadoptive placement, preference must be given, in the absence of good
19 cause to the contrary, to the Indian child's placement with one of the following, in descending order of priority:
20 (a) an Indian child's extended family member;
21 (b) a foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child's tribe;
22 (c) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing authority; or
23 (d) an institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization that
24 has a program suitable to meet the Indian child's needs.
25 (3) In the absence of good cause to the contrary, in an adoptive or other permanent placement of
26 an Indian child, preference must be given to a placement with one of the following, in descending order of
27 priority:
28 (a) extended family members;
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – SB 147

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 147.1
1 (b) an Indian family of the same tribe as the Indian child;
2 (c) another Indian family.
3 (4) Notwithstanding the placement preferences listed in subsections (2) and (3), if a different order
4 of placement preference is established by the Indian child's tribe, the court or agency implementing the
5 placement shall follow the order of preference established by the tribe if the placement is in the least restrictive
6 setting appropriate to the particular needs of the Indian child and within reasonable proximity to the child's
7 home.
8 (5) When appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or the child's parent must be considered
9 by the court.
10 (6) The standards to be applied in meeting the preference requirements of this section must be the
11 prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family
12 members of an Indian child reside or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and
13 cultural ties.
14 (7) Nothing in this section prevents the department or the court from placing an Indian child with a
15 parent to effectuate a permanency plan regardless of the parent's relationship to the Indian child's tribe.
16 (8) (a) If any party asserts that good cause to not follow the placement preferences exists, the
17 reasons for that belief or assertion must be stated orally on the record or provided in writing to the parties to the
18 child custody proceeding and the court.
19 (b) The party seeking departure from the placement preferences bears the burden of proving by
20 clear and convincing evidence that there is good cause to depart from the placement preferences.
21 (c) A court's determination of good cause to depart from the placement preferences must be made
22 on the record or in writing and must be based on one or more of the following considerations:
23 (i) the request of one or both of the Indian child's parents on attestation that they have reviewed
24 the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of preference provided for in subsections (2) and (3);
25 (ii) the request of the child, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to understand the decision
26 that is being made;
27 (iii) the presence of a sibling attachment that can be maintained only through a particular
28 placement;

1 (iv) the extraordinary physical, mental, or emotional needs of the Indian child, including but not
2 limited to specialized treatment services that may be unavailable in the community where families who meet the
3 placement preferences live; or
4 (v) the unavailability of a suitable placement after a determination by the court that a diligent
5 search was conducted to find suitable placements meeting the preference criteria, but no suitable placement
6 was found. For the purposes of this analysis, the standards for determining whether a placement is unavailable
7 must conform to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the Indian child's
8 parent or extended family resides or with which the Indian child's parent or extended family members maintain
9 social and cultural ties.
10 (d) A placement may not depart from the preferences based solely on the ordinary bonding or
11 attachment that developed from time spent in a nonpreferred placement.
12 (d)(e) A placement may not depart from the preferences based on the socioeconomic status of any
13 placement relative to another placement.
14 (f) The obligation to engage in a diligent search for a preferred placement is ongoing throughout
15 the case and must be documented in the record. The court shall inquire into the efforts to secure a preferred
16 placement at each hearing.
17 (9) If an Indian child is in a foster care placement that is not a preferred placement, the court shall
18 hold a status hearing no less than every 30 days to review the department's efforts to place a child in a
19 preferred placement consistent with this section.
20 (10) Except in an emergency removal, in the event the department intends to change the placement
21 of the child and the change in placement does not involve reunification of the child with a natural parent or
22 Indian custodian, the department shall, at least 2 business days prior to the change in placement, provide
23 written notice of the change to the child's tribe, parents, Indian custodian, guardian ad litem, and counsel for the
24 child, parents, Indian custodian, and tribe. The notice must provide the date the placement change is to occur
25 and the reason for the placement change. If the child's tribe or a party objects, the child's tribe or counsel for
26 the party shall notify the court and other parties. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch. 716, L. 2023.)"
