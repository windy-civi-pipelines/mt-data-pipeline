the license to the department, along with a report certified under penalty of law that the officer had reasonable
grounds to believe that the person was driving or was in actual physical control of a commercial motor vehicle

alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the person at the time of a test, as shown by analysis of a sample of the
person's blood, breath, oral fluid, or other bodily substance drawn or taken within a reasonable time after the

(a) if there was at that time an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or less, it may be inferred that the
person was not under the influence of alcohol;
(b) if there was at that time an alcohol concentration in excess of 0.04 but less than 0.08, that fact
may not give rise to any inference that the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol, but the fact

may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the person; and

offense under previous laws of this state."
