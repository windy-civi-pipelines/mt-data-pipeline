6 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
7 MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY OF ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING CHEMICALS,
8 PERFLUOROALKYL AND POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES, AND WATER QUALITY; AND REQUIRING
9 THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
10
11 WHEREAS, human reproduction is declining around the world, affecting men, women, and children;
12 and
13 WHEREAS, the decline in reproduction is attributed to unhealthy lifestyles and chemicals in the
14 environment; and
15 WHEREAS, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as phthalates, bisphenol A, flame-retardants, and
16 pesticides, interfere with the body's hormonal systems; and
17 WHEREAS, these endocrine-disrupting chemicals are found in toys, plastic drinking bottles, cleaning
18 supplies, house dust, home furniture, electronics, building materials, fragrances, food, food packaging, personal
19 care products, and drinking water; and
20 WHEREAS, exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may contribute to attention deficit hyperactivity
21 disorder, asthma, obesity, and early puberty in children; thyroid disorders, breast cancer, diabetes, obesity, and
22 infertility in women; and thyroid disorders, diabetes, obesity, infertility, prostate cancer, and low sperm count in
23 men; and
24 WHEREAS, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a large, complex group of
25 synthetic chemicals that have been used in consumer products around the world since the mid-20th century;
26 and
27 WHEREAS, PFAS are present in many different commercial products, such as nonstick coatings, stain-
28 resistant and water-resistant products, protective coatings, personal health care products, firefighting foams,

1 and architectural resins; and
2 WHEREAS, PFAS are mobile, persistent, and bioaccumulative, and are not known to degrade in the
3 environment; and
4 WHEREAS, people are most likely exposed to PFAS by consuming PFAS-contaminated water or food,
5 using products made with PFAS, or breathing air containing PFAS, but exposure to PFAS is difficult to assess
6 because new PFAS chemicals have been created in recent years; and
7 WHEREAS, multiple health effects associated with PFAS exposure have been identified and are
8 supported by different scientific studies, including reproductive effects, developmental effects or delays,
9 increased risk of some cancers, reduced ability of the body's immune system to fight infections, interference
10 with the body's natural hormones, and increased cholesterol levels or risk of obesity; and
11 WHEREAS, state and local government agencies and nongovernment organizations have
12 recommended eliminating or reducing the potential risks posed by exposure to PFAS to human health and the
13 environment; and
14 WHEREAS, research is ongoing to determine how different levels of exposure to different PFAS can
15 lead to a variety of health effects and to better understand the health effects associated with low levels of
16 exposure to PFAS over long periods of time; and
17 WHEREAS, PFAS accumulate in the residue of wastewater treatment plants throughout Montana,
18 amounting to toxic waste with no established method to store or dispose of it; and
19 WHEREAS, some residue with high levels of PFAS from wastewater treatment plants, known as
20 sludge, is used by ranchers, farmers, home gardeners, and others as fertilizer; and
21 WHEREAS, PFAS in fertilizer are absorbed by crops and enter the system of livestock, all of which are
22 then consumed by Montanans; and
23 WHEREAS, the Department of Environmental Quality has preliminarily studied PFAS, noted the health
24 risks associated with PFAS, and found extremely high amounts of PFAS in groundwater in various locations
25 throughout Montana; and
26 WHEREAS, statewide solutions should be explored in Montana to reduce or eliminate the potential
27 risks posed by PFAS to human health and the environment; and
28 WHEREAS, declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy may create a "demographic time bomb"

1 as future generations struggle to meet the needs and obligations of an older population, thereby reducing
2 economic growth, decreasing tax revenue, and increasing health care costs; and
3 WHEREAS, declining sperm counts, diminished ovarian reserves, and increasing miscarriage rates
4 could eventually threaten survival of the human race; and
5 WHEREAS, as a modest first step to combat what could become a global calamity, the Montana
6 Legislature should examine the threats of these chemicals in our drinking water.

8 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
9 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
10 That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
11 committee, pursuant to section 5-5-217, MCA, or direct sufficient staff resources to:
12 (1) review how existing state water quality laws and federal acts, including the Clean Water Act
13 and the Safe Drinking Water Act, protect water quality in Montana and regulate endocrine-disrupting chemicals;
14 (2) study the presence of PFAS in Montana, including potential sources of PFAS, sampling and
15 testing methods to identify the presence of PFAS, and routes of human and ecological exposure;
16 (2)(3) analyze research related to the health effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals;
17 (4) examine the dangers associated with exposure to PFAS in Montana, including through
18 consumption in food and water systems;
19 (3)(5) determine, if possible, the prevalence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in Montana; and
20 (6) investigate potential solutions to the harms associated with PFAS, including public health
21 interventions, environmental remediation, labeling requirements on products, recommendations to the
22 Department of Justice for legal actions to recover damages for injuries occurring in Montana caused by
23 manufacturers of PFAS, and the prohibition of the manufacturing or sale of certain products containing PFAS;
24 and
25 (4)(7) offer recommendations for future study, rulemaking, or changes to law related to water quality,
26 PFAS, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
27 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the study is assigned to staff, any findings or conclusions be
28 presented to and reviewed by an appropriate committee designated by the Legislative Council.
