6 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF

8 QUALITY; AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH

10
11 WHEREAS, human reproduction is declining around the world, affecting men, women, and children;
12 and
13 WHEREAS, the decline in reproduction is attributed to unhealthy lifestyles and chemicals in the
14 environment; and
15 WHEREAS, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as phthalates, bisphenol A, flame-retardants, and
16 pesticides, interfere with the body's hormonal systems; and
17 WHEREAS, these endocrine-disrupting chemicals are found in toys, plastic drinking bottles, cleaning
18 supplies, house dust, home furniture, electronics, building materials, fragrances, food, food packaging, personal
19 care products, and drinking water; and
20 WHEREAS, exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may contribute to attention deficit hyperactivity
21 disorder, asthma, obesity, and early puberty in children; thyroid disorders, breast cancer, diabetes, obesity, and
22 infertility in women; and thyroid disorders, diabetes, obesity, infertility, prostate cancer, and low sperm count in
23 men; and
24 WHEREAS, declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy may create a "demographic time bomb"
25 as future generations struggle to meet the needs and obligations of an older population, thereby reducing
26 economic growth, decreasing tax revenue, and increasing health care costs; and
27 WHEREAS, declining sperm counts, diminished ovarian reserves, and increasing miscarriage rates
28 could eventually threaten survival of the human race; and

9 and the Safe Drinking Water Act, protect water quality in Montana and regulate endocrine-disrupting chemicals;
10 (2) analyze research related to the health effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals;
11 (3) determine, if possible, the prevalence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in Montana; and
12 (4) offer recommendations for future study, rulemaking, or changes to law related to water quality
13 and endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
14 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the study is assigned to staff, any findings or conclusions be
