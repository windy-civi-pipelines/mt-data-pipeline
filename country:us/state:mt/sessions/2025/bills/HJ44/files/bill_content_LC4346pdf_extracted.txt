1 _____________ JOINT RESOLUTION NO. _____________
3
4 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
5 MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY OF ENDOCRINE-DISRUPTING CHEMICALS AND WATER
6 QUALITY; AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH
7 LEGISLATURE.
8
9 WHEREAS, human reproduction is declining around the world, affecting men, women, and children;
10 and
11 WHEREAS, the decline in reproduction is attributed to unhealthy lifestyles and chemicals in the
12 environment; and
13 WHEREAS, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as phthalates, bisphenol A, flame-retardants, and
14 pesticides, interfere with the body's hormonal systems; and
15 WHEREAS, these endocrine-disrupting chemicals are found in toys, plastic drinking bottles, cleaning
16 supplies, house dust, home furniture, electronics, building materials, fragrances, food, food packaging, personal
17 care products, and drinking water; and
18 WHEREAS, exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may contribute to attention deficit hyperactivity
19 disorder, asthma, obesity, and early puberty in children; thyroid disorders, breast cancer, diabetes, obesity, and
20 infertility in women; and thyroid disorders, diabetes, obesity, infertility, prostate cancer, and low sperm count in
21 men; and
22 WHEREAS, declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy may create a "demographic time bomb"
23 as future generations struggle to meet the needs and obligations of an older population, thereby reducing
24 economic growth, decreasing tax revenue, and increasing health care costs; and
25 WHEREAS, declining sperm counts, diminished ovarian reserves, and increasing miscarriage rates
26 could eventually threaten survival of the human race; and
27 WHEREAS, as a modest first step to combat what could become a global calamity, the Montana
28 Legislature should examine the threats of these chemicals in our drinking water.
