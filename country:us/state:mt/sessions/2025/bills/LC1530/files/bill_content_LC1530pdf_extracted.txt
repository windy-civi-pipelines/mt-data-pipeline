24
25 Section 8. Section 20-5-501, MCA, is amended to read:
26 "20-5-501. Purpose -- legislative intent -- parental rights -- definitions. (1) The legislature
27 recognizes that the rights of parents to the custody and control of a child are based upon liberties secured by
28 the United States and Montana constitutions and that a parent's rights to that custody and control of a child are
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – ****
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC1530.1
1 therefore normally supreme to the interests of other persons. The legislature also recognizes a growing
2 phenomenon in which absent or otherwise unavailable parents have temporarily surrendered the custody and
3 care of their children to a grandparent or other relative for lengthy periods of time. Regardless of the purpose of
4 the absence, a child willfully surrendered to a relative for an extended time period still has the same needs as a
5 child in the care of its parents. In this situation, a caretaker relative assumes responsibilities for the child but
6 has no legal right of control over the child, a situation that interferes in the caretaker relative's ability to perform
7 routine functions of child rearing, including tending to the educational and educationally related medical needs
8 of the child. It is therefore the purpose of the legislature in these instances to protect the rights of a child
9 granted by Article II, section 15, of the Montana constitution by granting a caretaker relative limited authority for
10 a child left in the relative's care.
11 (2) It is the intent of the legislature that a caretaker relative given the responsibility of caring for a
12 child with little or no warning and without any other provision having been made for the child's care, such as the
13 appointment of a guardian or the provision of a power of attorney, be granted authority to enroll the child in
14 school, discuss with the school district the child's educational progress, and consent to an educational service
15 and to medical care for the child related to an educational service without superseding any parental rights
16 regarding the child.
17 (3) This part is not intended to affect the rights and responsibilities of a parent, legal guardian, or
18 other custodian regarding the child, does not grant legal custody of the child to the caretaker relative, and does
19 not grant authority to the caretaker relative to consent to the marriage or adoption of the child or to receive
20 notice of a medical procedure, including abortion, not consented to by the relative, if notice is required by law,
21 for the child except as expressly provided in this section.
22 (4) For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
23 (a) "Caretaker relative" or "relative" means an individual related by blood, marriage, or adoption by
24 another individual to the child whose care is undertaken by the relative, but who is not a parent, foster parent,
25 stepparent, or legal guardian of the child.
26 (b) "Caretaker relative educational authorization affidavit" or "affidavit" means an affidavit
27 completed in compliance with 20-5-503.
28 (c) "Health care provider" means a person who provides medical care.
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – ****
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC1530.1
1 (d) "Medical care" means care by a health care provider, for which parental consent is normally
2 required, for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a mental, physical, or dental injury or disease.
3 (e) "Parent" means a biological parent, adoptive parent, or other legal guardian of the child whose
4 parental rights have not been terminated."

6 Section 9. Section 27-1-718, MCA, is amended to read:
7 "27-1-718. Civil penalty for shoplifting. (1) An adult or emancipated minor who takes possession of
8 any goods, wares, or merchandise displayed or offered for sale by any store or other mercantile establishment
9 without the consent of the owner or seller and with the intention of converting the goods to the taker's own use
10 without having paid the purchase price of the goods is liable to the owner or seller for a penalty, whether or not
11 the goods have been returned undamaged, in the amount of the greater of $100 or the retail value of the goods,
12 not to exceed $1,000. This amount is in addition to actual damages.
13 (2) When an unemancipated minor takes possession of any goods, wares, or merchandise
14 displayed or offered for sale by any store or other mercantile establishment without the consent of the owner or
15 seller and with the intention of converting the goods to the minor's own use without having paid the purchase
16 price of the goods, the minor's parent or legal guardian having custody of the minor is liable to the owner or
17 seller for a penalty, whether or not the goods have been returned undamaged, equal to the greater of $100 or
18 the retail value of the goods, not to exceed $1,000. For the purposes of this subsection (2), liability may not be
19 imposed upon any governmental or private agency that has been assigned responsibility for the minor child
20 pursuant to court order or action of the department of corrections or the department of public health and human
21 services.
22 (3) Judgments and claims arising under this section may be assigned.
23 (4) A conviction for violation of 45-6-301 is not a condition precedent to maintenance of a civil
24 action under this section.
25 (5) For purposes of this section, the term "emancipated minor" means a person under 18 years of
26 age who is self-supporting from personal earnings or is married. A person who received more than 25% of the
27 cost of support from any person other than an agency of the government may not be considered an
28 emancipated minor."

24 "40-6-501. Purpose -- legislative intent -- parental rights -- definitions. (1) The legislature
25 recognizes that the rights of parents to the custody and control of a child are based upon liberties secured by
26 the United States and Montana constitutions and that a parent's rights to that custody and control of a child are
27 therefore normally supreme to the interests of other persons. The legislature also recognizes a growing
28 phenomenon in which absent or otherwise unavailable parents have temporarily surrendered the custody and

69th Legislature 2025 LC1530.1
1 care of their children to a grandparent or other relative for lengthy periods of time. Regardless of the purpose of
2 the absence, a child willfully surrendered to a relative for an extended time period still has the same needs as a
3 child in the care of its parents. In this situation, a caretaker relative assumes responsibilities for the child but
4 has no legal right of control over the child, a situation that interferes in the caretaker relative's ability to perform
5 routine functions of child rearing, including tending to the medical needs of the child. It is therefore the purpose
6 of the legislature in these instances to protect the rights of a child granted by Article II, section 15, of the
7 Montana constitution by granting a caretaker relative limited authority for a child left in the relative's care.
8 (2) It is the intent of the legislature that a caretaker relative given the responsibility of caring for a
9 child with little or no warning and without any other provision having been made for the child's care, such as the
10 appointment of a guardian or the provision of a power of attorney, be granted authority to consent to medical
11 care for the child without superseding any parental rights regarding the child.
12 (3) Section 40-6-502 and this section are not intended to affect the rights and responsibilities of a
13 parent, legal guardian, or other custodian regarding the child, do not grant legal custody of the child to the
14 caretaker relative, and do not grant authority to the caretaker relative to consent to the marriage or adoption of
15 the child or to receive notice of a medical procedure, including abortion, not consented to by the relative, if
16 notice is required by law, for the child except as expressly provided in this section.
17 (4) For the purposes of 40-6-502 and this section, the following definitions apply:
18 (a) "Caretaker relative" or "relative" means an individual related by blood, marriage, or adoption by
19 another individual to the child whose care is undertaken by the relative, but who is not a parent, foster parent,
20 stepparent, or legal guardian of the child.
21 (b) "Caretaker relative medical authorization affidavit" or "affidavit" means an affidavit completed in
22 compliance with 40-6-502.
23 (c) "Health care provider" means a person who provides medical care.

25 required, for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a mental, physical, or dental injury or disease.

14 an emancipated minor to consent to the provision of health services or to control access to protected health
15 care information under applicable law.
16 (2) The consent to the provision of health services and to control access to protected health care
17 information by a health care facility or to the performance of health services by a health professional may be
18 given by a minor when the health professional, in good faith and with a reasonable belief supported by fact,

25 disease, including a sexually transmitted disease, or drug and substance abuse, including alcohol. This self-
26 consent applies only to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of those conditions specified in this subsection
27 (2)(c). The self-consent in the case of pregnancy, a sexually transmitted disease, or drug and substance abuse
28 also obliges the health professional, if the health professional accepts the responsibility for treatment, to

12 minor shall not be liable for payment for such service unless the spouse, parent, parents, or legal guardian
13 have expressly agreed to pay for such care. Minors so consenting for such health services shall thereby

1 therefore normally supreme to the interests of other persons. The legislature also recognizes a growing
2 phenomenon in which absent or otherwise unavailable parents have temporarily surrendered the custody and
3 care of their children to a grandparent or other relative for lengthy periods of time. Regardless of the purpose of
4 the absence, a child willfully surrendered to a relative for an extended time period still has the same needs as a
5 child in the care of its parents. In this situation, a caretaker relative assumes responsibilities for the child but
6 has no legal right of control over the child, a situation that interferes in the caretaker relative's ability to perform
7 routine functions of child rearing, including tending to the educational and educationally related medical needs
8 of the child. It is therefore the purpose of the legislature in these instances to protect the rights of a child
9 granted by Article II, section 15, of the Montana constitution by granting a caretaker relative limited authority for
10 a child left in the relative's care.
11 (2) It is the intent of the legislature that a caretaker relative given the responsibility of caring for a
12 child with little or no warning and without any other provision having been made for the child's care, such as the
13 appointment of a guardian or the provision of a power of attorney, be granted authority to enroll the child in
14 school, discuss with the school district the child's educational progress, and consent to an educational service
15 and to medical care for the child related to an educational service without superseding any parental rights
16 regarding the child.
17 (3) This part is not intended to affect the rights and responsibilities of a parent, legal guardian, or
18 other custodian regarding the child, does not grant legal custody of the child to the caretaker relative, and does
19 not grant authority to the caretaker relative to consent to the marriage or adoption of the child or to receive
20 notice of a medical procedure, including abortion, not consented to by the relative, if notice is required by law,
21 for the child except as expressly provided in this section.
22 (4) For the purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
23 (a) "Caretaker relative" or "relative" means an individual related by blood, marriage, or adoption by
24 another individual to the child whose care is undertaken by the relative, but who is not a parent, foster parent,
25 stepparent, or legal guardian of the child.

27 completed in compliance with 20-5-503.

11 the goods have been returned undamaged, in the amount of the greater of $100 or the retail value of the goods,
12 not to exceed $1,000. This amount is in addition to actual damages.
13 (2) When an unemancipated minor takes possession of any goods, wares, or merchandise
14 displayed or offered for sale by any store or other mercantile establishment without the consent of the owner or
15 seller and with the intention of converting the goods to the minor's own use without having paid the purchase
16 price of the goods, the minor's parent or legal guardian having custody of the minor is liable to the owner or
17 seller for a penalty, whether or not the goods have been returned undamaged, equal to the greater of $100 or
18 the retail value of the goods, not to exceed $1,000. For the purposes of this subsection (2), liability may not be
19 imposed upon any governmental or private agency that has been assigned responsibility for the minor child
20 pursuant to court order or action of the department of corrections or the department of public health and human
21 services.

69th Legislature 2025 LC1530.1
1 care of their children to a grandparent or other relative for lengthy periods of time. Regardless of the purpose of
2 the absence, a child willfully surrendered to a relative for an extended time period still has the same needs as a
3 child in the care of its parents. In this situation, a caretaker relative assumes responsibilities for the child but
4 has no legal right of control over the child, a situation that interferes in the caretaker relative's ability to perform
5 routine functions of child rearing, including tending to the medical needs of the child. It is therefore the purpose
6 of the legislature in these instances to protect the rights of a child granted by Article II, section 15, of the
7 Montana constitution by granting a caretaker relative limited authority for a child left in the relative's care.
8 (2) It is the intent of the legislature that a caretaker relative given the responsibility of caring for a
