12 511.
13 (2) An entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under

19 rights under 30-8-505 through 30-8-508.
20 (4) An entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under
21 subsection (1) may be enforced against a purchaser of the financial asset or interest therein only if:

24 security entitlements of all of its entitlement holders to that financial asset;

69th Legislature 2025 LC0293.1
1 entitlements with respect to a particular financial asset, may recover the financial asset, or interest therein, from
2 the purchaser. If the trustee or other liquidator elects not to pursue that right, an entitlement holder whose
3 security entitlement remains unsatisfied has the right to recover its interest in the financial asset from the
4 purchaser.
5 (6) An action based on the entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular
6 financial asset under subsection (1), whether framed in conversion, replevin, constructive trust, equitable lien,
7 or other theory, may not be asserted against any purchaser of a financial asset or interest therein who gives
8 value, obtains control, and does not act in collusion with the securities intermediary in violating the securities
9 intermediary's obligations under 30-8-504."

13 provided in subsections (2) and (3), if If a securities intermediary does not have sufficient interests in a
14 particular financial asset to satisfy both its obligations to entitlement holders who have security entitlements to
15 that financial asset and its obligation to a creditor of the securities intermediary who has a security interest in
16 that financial asset, the claims of entitlement holders, other than the creditor, have priority over the claim of the
17 creditor.
18 (2) A claim of a creditor of a securities intermediary who has a security interest in a financial asset
19 held by a securities intermediary has priority over claims of the securities intermediary's entitlement holders
20 who have security entitlements with respect to that financial asset if the creditor has control over the financial
21 asset.
22 (3) If a clearing corporation does not have sufficient financial assets to satisfy both its obligations
23 to entitlement holders who have security entitlements with respect to a financial asset and its obligation to a
24 creditor of the clearing corporation who has a security interest in that financial asset, the claim of the creditor
25 has priority over the claims of entitlement holders."
