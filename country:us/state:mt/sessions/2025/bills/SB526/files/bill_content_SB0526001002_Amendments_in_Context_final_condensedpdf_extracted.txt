11 WHEREAS, there is a primary care crisis in Indian Country; and
12 WHEREAS, American Indian and Alaska Native people in Montana have very limited access to health
13 care services and are disproportionately affected by oral health care, primary health care, and behavioral health
14 care disparities, which are directly attributed to a lack of health care professionals in Indian communities and
15 have caused a serious access issue and backlog of many health care services for American Indian and Alaska
16 Native citizens in Montana; and
17 WHEREAS, the tribes of Montana successfully partnered to provide training and education for dental
18 health aide practitioners who will go on to serve urban and rural American Indian populations with the specific
19 purpose of improving population oral health through filling service gaps, community outreach, and offering
20 culturally responsive care; and
21 WHEREAS, tribal clinics are often the only dental clinic that accepts Medicaid-eligible patients in rural
22 areas. Increasing provider capacity at tribal clinics will benefit the entire community. Even in instances where
23 the tribe does not provide health care to nonbeneficiaries, increasing provider capacity at clinics serving
24 Medicaid-eligible individuals benefits all patients because of the overall increases in capacity; and
25 WHEREAS, many tribes in Montana have great difficulty and face challenges in recruiting and retaining
26 health care professionals in their communities, resulting in further challenges to ensure continuity and
27 comprehensive health care for all people in Montana under Article II, section 3, of the Montana Constitution;
