9 WHEREAS, there is a primary care crisis in Indian Country; and
10 WHEREAS, American Indian and Alaska Native people in Montana have very limited access to health
11 care services and are disproportionately affected by oral health care, primary health care, and behavioral health
12 care disparities, which are directly attributed to a lack of health care professionals in Indian communities and
13 have caused a serious access issue and backlog of many health care services for American Indian and Alaska
14 Native citizens in Montana; and
15 WHEREAS, the tribes of Montana successfully partnered to provide training and education for dental
16 health aide practitioners who will go on to serve urban and rural American Indian populations with the specific
17 purpose of improving population oral health through filling service gaps, community outreach, and offering
18 culturally responsive care; and
19 WHEREAS, tribal clinics are often the only dental clinic that accepts MEDICAID-eligible patients in rural
20 areas. Increasing provider capacity at tribal clinics will benefit the entire community. Even in instances where
21 the tribe does not provide health care to NONBENEFICIARIES, increasing provider capacity at clinics serving
22 MEDICAID-eligible individuals benefits all patients because of the overall increases in capacity; and
23 WHEREAS, many tribes in Montana have great difficulty and face challenges in recruiting and retaining
24 health care professionals in their communities, resulting in further challenges to ensure continuity and
25 comprehensive health care for all people in Montana under Article II, section 3, of the Montana Constitution;
26 and
27 WHEREAS, tribes in Montana are implementing the community health aide program. The Alaska
28 community health aide program has been in existence since the 1960s and is a program of the Indian Health

1 Service. The community health aide program has been an effective method for diminishing health disparities of
2 Alaska Natives and promoting access to health CARE services and health CARE provider education for Alaska
3 Natives residing in rural and remote communities. THE PROGRAM also provides opportunities to incorporate
4 social determinants of health; and
5 WHEREAS, the community health aide program educates providers from within tribal communities to
6 provide valued, patient-centered, AND quality care. These providers understand the history, culture, and, in
7 some cases, the language of their patients and can integrate that knowledge into their care. Community health
8 aide program providers offer routine, preventative, and emergent health care through community health aides
9 and practitioners, behavioral health aides and practitioners, and dental health aides and practitioners; and
10 WHEREAS, tribes are investing in higher education, wealth generation activities, and health care for
11 their citizens, thereby incorporating social determinates of health. However, college attainment during the
12 previous 20-year period only rose 3.9% compared to 7.6% in the rest of the United States. Approximately 15%
13 of American Indian and Alaska Native adults in the northwest region of the United States have less than a high
14 school degree, and, compared to the general population, a smaller proportion have attained a baccalaureate or
15 graduate degree.
