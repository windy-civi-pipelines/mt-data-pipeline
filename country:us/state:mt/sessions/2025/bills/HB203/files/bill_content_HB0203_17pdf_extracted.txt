19 its early economic and societal growth and the discovery and development of many other deposits of metals
20 and minerals, including coal, silver, and copper; and
21 WHEREAS, mining in Montana subsequently grew and supplied the nation with much of its mineral
22 resource needs, including copper from Butte that was smelted in Anaconda and refined in Great Falls, and
