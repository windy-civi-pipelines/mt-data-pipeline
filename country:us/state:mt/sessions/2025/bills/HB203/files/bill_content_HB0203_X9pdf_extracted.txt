Section 1:
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 203
WHEREAS, the state motto of Montana, adopted on February 9, 1865, is "oro y plata", which is
Spanish for "gold and silver", and reflects our mining heritage and vast mineral wealth; and
WHEREAS, the Great Seal of the state of Montana is a vivid symbol of all that is special about our
state and includes the state motto and a miner's pick and shovel; and
WHEREAS, the nickname of Montana is "the Treasure State", which was chosen because of the state's
vast mineral resources; and
WHEREAS, gold was first discovered in Montana in the 1850s, leading to major finds at Bannack,
Virginia City, Silver Bow Creek, and Prickly Pear Creek; and
WHEREAS, these major finds brought many of the first settlers and developers to Montana, leading to
its early economic and societal growth and the discovery and development of many other deposits of metals
and minerals, including coal, silver, and copper; and
WHEREAS, mining in Montana subsequently grew and supplied the nation with much of its mineral
resource needs, including copper from Butte that was smelted in Anaconda and refined in Great Falls, and
which powered the electrification of America and fueled the country's victorious efforts in both World Wars; and
WHEREAS, the mining of lignite and bituminous coal from eastern Montana coal beds heated homes
and fired steam-powered locomotives in the early 20th century and continues to provide the largest share of
Montana's electricity generation; and
WHEREAS, Montana's placer, underground, and surface mining employed thousands at hundreds of
mines, producing billions in wealth; and
WHEREAS, the mining industry continues to contribute billions of dollars to Montana's economy,
creating thousands of permanent jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenues to the state and local communities
each year; and

WHEREAS, there have been thousands of miners who died in the early days of Montana mining, but
whose deaths have led to world-leading safety and labor standards for workers today; and
WHEREAS, there have been historic environmental and social impacts from mining in Montana that
have led to world-leading environmental regulations and financial assurances for the protection of our
environment and communities; and
WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature authorized in 1893 the creation of the Montana State School of
Mines in Butte, now known as Montana Technological University (Montana Tech), which continues to be one of
the nation's leading schools in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and mining of natural
resources today; and
WHEREAS, Montana continues to hold significant deposits of minerals, including those critical for our
nation's current and future defense, economic and technological advancement, and energy transition and
security; and
WHEREAS, our state is proud of its heritage, its present, and its future in mining and mineral
processing and believes it is vital to promote and educate the public about the costs and benefits of responsible
mining in Montana sufficiently and accurately.
