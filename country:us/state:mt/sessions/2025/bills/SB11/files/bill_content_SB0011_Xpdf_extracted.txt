69th Legislature 2025 SB 11
(2) set out fully the ordinance sought, the ordinance to be amended and the proposed amendment,
or the ordinance to be repealed;
(3) be in the form provided by [sections 1 through 13]; and
(4) contain transition provisions if the measure changes terms of office or forms of government.
Section 4. Procedure for election on local government petition. (1) Except as provided in 7-5-
131, the electors of a local government may, by petition, request an election on whether to enact, repeal, or
amend an ordinance.
(2) Except as provided in [section 9(3)], a petition under [sections 4 through 10] signed by at least
15% of the local government's qualified electors is sufficient to require an election. In order to determine the

concise statement of purpose and implication not exceeding 135 words. The statement of purpose and
implication must be an accurate and impartial explanation of the purpose of the proposed ballot issue in plain,
easily understood language. The statement may not be an argument and may not be written so as to create
prejudice for or against the issue. The statement prepared pursuant to this subsection, unless altered by court

purposes of this subsection (5), the word limit does not apply to additional statements required on the ballot by
law, including those provided in 7-7-111 and 15-10-425(3).
(6) (a) At the time the statement of purpose and implication is prepared, the local government
attorney shall prepare a yes and no statement. A yes and no statement specifies that a positive vote indicates
support for the issue and a negative vote indicates opposition to the issue.

ballot in a manner similar to the following:
☐ YES on (insert the type of ballot issue and its number)
☐ NO on (insert the type of ballot issue and its number)

subsection (6)(b).
Section 5. Form of petition. (1) A local government petition must be substantially in the form
provided by [sections 4 through 10]. Clerical or technical errors that do not interfere with the ability to judge the
sufficiency of signatures on the petition do not render a petition void.
(2) (a) Petition sheets may not exceed 8 1/2 x 14 inches in size. Separate sheets of a petition may

ordinance referred or the petition title. If signature lines are printed on both the front and back of a petition
sheet, the information required above must appear on both the front and back of the sheet.

(c) Voters are urged to read the complete text of the proposal, which appears (on the reverse side
