3 legislator shall sign the cosponsor form attached to the legislation in order to be added as a cosponsor.
4 (2) After legislation is submitted for introduction, sponsors may be added on motion of the chief sponsor
5 at any time prior to a standing committee report on the bill or resolution. Forms for adding sponsors will be

24 who has not spoken.
25 S50-40. Procedure upon offering a motion. (1) When a motion is offered it must be restated by the
26 presiding officer. If requested by the presiding officer or a Senator, it must be reduced to writing, presented at
27 the rostrum, and read aloud by the Secretary.

- 18 - LC 2244
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2244
1 upon.

21 Senators physically or remotely present and voting. When a bill or resolution is postponed indefinitely after
22 debate on second reading, it is finally rejected and may not be acted upon again except upon a motion of
23 reconsideration as provided in S50-90.
24 (4) A motion or proposition on a subject different from that under consideration may not be accepted
25 unless a substitute motion is in order.
26 S50-60. Nondebatable motions. The following motions are not debatable:
27 (1) to adjourn for the day;

13 (14) all incidental motions, such as motions relating to voting or other questions of a general procedural
14 nature.
15 S50-70. Amending motions -- restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (2), no more than one
16 amendment and no more than one substitute motion may be made to a motion. This rule permits the main
17 motion and two modifying motions.

19 not be amended.
20 S50-80. Previous question. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the effect of calling for the
21 previous question, if adopted, is to close debate immediately, to prevent the offering of amendments or other
22 subsidiary motions, and to bring to vote promptly the immediately pending main question and the adhering
23 subsidiary motions, whether on appeal or otherwise. The motion for the previous question is nondebatable as
24 provided in S50-60(7).
25 (2) When the previous question is ordered on any debatable question on which there has been no
26 debate, the question may be debated for one-half hour, one-half of that time to be given to the proponents and
27 one-half to the opponents. The sponsor of the main motion on which the previous question is adopted may
28 close on the motion regardless of whether debate on the main motion has occurred.
- 20 - LC 2244
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2244
1 (3) A call of the Senate is not in order after the previous question is ordered unless it appears upon an
2 actual count by the presiding officer that a quorum is not physically and remotely present.
3 S50-90. Reconsideration -- time restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (6), any Senator may, on the
4 day the vote was taken or on the next day the Senate is in session, move to reconsider the question. A motion
5 to reconsider is a debatable motion, but the debate is limited to the motion. The debate on a motion to
6 reconsider may not address the substance of the matter for which reconsideration is sought. However, an
7 inquiry may be made concerning the purpose of the motion to reconsider.
8 (2) A motion to reconsider must be disposed of when made unless a proper substitute motion is made
9 and adopted.
10 (3) A motion to recall a bill from the House of Representatives constitutes notice to reconsider and must
11 be acted on as a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider or to recall a bill from the House of
12 Representatives may be made only under Order of Business No. 9 and, under that order of business, takes
13 precedence over all motions except motions to recess or adjourn.
14 (4) When a motion to reconsider is laid on the table, a two-thirds majority is required to take it from the
15 table. When a motion to reconsider fails, the question is finally and conclusively settled.
16 (5) If a motion to reconsider third reading action is carried, there may not be further action until the
17 succeeding legislative day.
18 (6) If the Senate has adjourned for more than 2 days, then a motion to reconsider action taken on the
19 last day the Senate was in session is in order on the day the Senate reconvenes or on the following legislative
20 day.
21 S50-95. Rereferral. (1) Legislation that is in the possession of the Senate and that has been reported
22 from a committee with a do pass or be concurred in recommendation may be rereferred to a Senate committee

27 (b) The third-reading agenda must specify that the legislation rereferred and reported from committee
28 under subsection (2)(a) was rereferred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee and reported from the
- 21 - LC 2244
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2244
1 committee without amendments as passed on second reading.
2 (3) The individual making the rereferral motion shall announce the bill number, short bill title, and the
3 name of the sponsor of the bill immediately before it may be considered for rereferral.
4
5 S50-100. Dividing a question -- segregation excluded. A Senator may request to divide a question if
6 it includes two or more propositions so distinct in substance that if one thing is taken away a substantive
7 question will remain. A vote is not required on a request to divide a question, but the chair may rule that a
8 question is not divisible. The ruling of the chair may be appealed as provided in S20-10 and S20-20. For an
9 appeal of a ruling of the presiding officer, the question for the Senate must be stated as, "Shall the ruling of the
10 chair be upheld?". A motion to segregate pursuant to S50-140(4) is not a request to divide a question.
11 S50-110. Rules for questions or bills requiring other than a majority vote. (1) Except as provided
12 in subsection (2), if a question or bill requires more than a majority vote for final passage, a majority vote is
13 sufficient to decide any question relating to the question or bill prior to third reading.
14 (2) Any vote in the Senate on a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana Constitution under
15 circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-thirds vote of
16 the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote. This rule does not
17 prevent a committee from indefinitely postponing or tabling a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana
18 Constitution.
19 (3) If a bill has been amended in the House of Representatives and the amendments are accepted by
20 the Senate, the bill must again be placed on third reading in the Senate to determine if the required number of
21 votes has been cast.
22 S50-120. Committee reports to Senate -- reconsideration. (1) Reports of standing committees must
23 be read on Order of Business No. 2, and, if there is no objection to form, are considered adopted. Subject to
24 subsection (4), debate may not be had on any report.
25 (2) On an adverse committee report, the sponsor may respond to the chair of the committee making the
26 report.
27 (3) Any Senator seeking a reconsideration of the Senate's action on the adoption of a committee report
28 shall do so on Order of Business No. 9 by motion to reconsider as provided in S50-90. Any Senator may make
- 22 - LC 2244
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2244
1 the reconsideration motion and need not have voted on the prevailing side. This rule applies notwithstanding
2 any joint rule to the contrary. Subject to S50-90(6), the reconsideration motion must be made within 1 legislative
3 day of the adoption of the committee report and is not in order if the bill has been considered in Committee of
4 the Whole.

6 time, except during a call of the Senate, when a vote is being taken, or during Committee of the Whole.

8 Committee by the Committee of the Whole.
9 S50-130. Conference committee -- reports. (1) When a conference committee report is filed with the
10 Secretary of the Senate, the report must be read under Order of Business No. 3, select committees, and placed
11 on the calendar the succeeding legislative day for consideration on second reading. If recommended favorably
12 by the Committee of the Whole, it may be considered on third reading the same legislative day.
13 (2) If both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopt the same conference committee report
14 on legislation requiring more than a majority vote for final passage, the Senate, following approval of the
15 conference committee report on third reading, shall place the final form of the legislation on third reading to
16 determine if the required vote is obtained.
17 (3) If the Senate rejects a conference committee report, the committee continues to exist unless
18 dissolved by the President or by motion. The committee may file a subsequent report.
19 (4) A Senate conference committee may confer regarding matters assigned to it with any House
20 conference committee with like jurisdiction and submit recommendations for consideration of the Senate.
21 S50-135. Adjournment sine die. (1) Subject to Article V, section 10(5), of the Montana Constitution, a

28 approval of a motion for that purpose.

1 (2) After a Committee of the Whole has been formed, the President shall appoint a chair to preside.
2 (3) All legislation considered in the Committee of the Whole must be read by a summary of its title. The
3 sponsor shall make an opening statement, proposed amendments must be considered, and then the bill must

6 legislation. If the motion prevails, the legislation remains on second reading.

13 the sponsor and the vote on each.

9 No. 7, in addition to other methods, a recorded vote may be made in the following manner: the chair may call
10 for a voice vote to accept or reject a question. If the vote is other than unanimous, the chair may ask that the
11 lesser number on the question indicate their vote by an approved method of counting votes. The Secretary will
12 then record the vote. The chair may then rule that unless excused those of the greater number and physically
13 or remotely present have voted on the prevailing side of the question and that their vote be recorded as voting

15 individual nominee or group of nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees
16 being considered by the committee, the committee member may prepare an amendment for executive action to
17 strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a group of nominees is stricken, the committee
18 member that offered the amendment shall make a motion to request a committee resolution for the nominee or
19 nominees to be considered by a separate resolution. A simple majority of the committee is sufficient in order to
20 request a separate committee resolution.
21 (3) Within the Committee of the Whole, if a Senator wishes to have an individual nominee or group of
22 nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees recommended by the committee,
23 the Senator may prepare a floor amendment to strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a
24 group of nominees is stricken, a Senator may make a motion to request that the President of the Senate submit
25 a bill draft request for that the nominee or nominees to be considered by a separate resolution.
26 (4) When the resolution for an individual or group nomination has been prepared and introduced, the

- 29 - LC 2244
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2244
1 committee takes action on the separate resolution. After the committee's executive action, the committee chair
2 shall issue a standing committee report.
3 (5) The Secretary will read the reports under Order of Business No. 2, reports of standing committees.
4 (6) After the report has been read, the resolution must be placed on Order of Business No. 7 the next
5 legislative day for consideration by the Senate. Motions to approve or disapprove of the resolution are in order
6 and may be debated. Approval upon second reading constitutes confirmation of the Governor's nominee. A
7 motion to reconsider the approval or disapproval of a nomination made on second reading must occur within

17 prevent a committee from indefinitely postponing or tabling a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana
18 Constitution.

20 the Senate, the bill must again be placed on third reading in the Senate to determine if the required number of

12 by the Committee of the Whole, it may be considered on third reading the same legislative day.
13 (2) If both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopt the same conference committee report
14 on legislation requiring more than a majority vote for final passage, the Senate, following approval of the
15 conference committee report on third reading, shall place the final form of the legislation on third reading to
16 determine if the required vote is obtained.
17 (3) If the Senate rejects a conference committee report, the committee continues to exist unless
18 dissolved by the President or by motion. The committee may file a subsequent report.
19 (4) A Senate conference committee may confer regarding matters assigned to it with any House
20 conference committee with like jurisdiction and submit recommendations for consideration of the Senate.

10 for a voice vote to accept or reject a question. If the vote is other than unanimous, the chair may ask that the
11 lesser number on the question indicate their vote by an approved method of counting votes. The Secretary will
12 then record the vote. The chair may then rule that unless excused those of the greater number and physically
13 or remotely present have voted on the prevailing side of the question and that their vote be recorded as voting
