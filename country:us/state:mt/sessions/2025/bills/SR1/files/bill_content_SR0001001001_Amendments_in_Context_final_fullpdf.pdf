22 Secretary of the Senate shall assign an appropriate sequential number, which constitutes introduction of the
23 legislation. Legislation properly introduced or received in the Senate must be announced across the rostrum
24 and public notice provided. This announcement constitutes first reading, and no debate or motion is in order
25 except that a Senator may question adherence to rules. Acknowledgment by the Secretary of the Senate of
26 receipt of legislation transmitted from the House commences the time limit for consideration of the legislation.
27 All legislation received by the Senate may be referred to a committee prior to being read across the rostrum.
28 (2) Bills and resolutions preintroduced as provided in Joint Rule 40-40 may be assigned to committee

8 bill status system.

10 the Senate for introduction, the chief sponsor may add representatives and senators as cosponsors. A
11 legislator shall sign the cosponsor form attached to the legislation in order to be added as a cosponsor.
12 (2) After legislation is submitted for introduction, sponsors may be added on motion of the chief sponsor
13 at any time prior to a standing committee report on the bill or resolution. Forms for adding sponsors will be
14 supplied on request by the Secretary of the Senate.

17 Division with the original bill for the inclusion of the names in subsequent printings of the bill or resolution.
18 S40-40. Reading limitations. (1) Every bill must be read three times prior to passage, either by title or

4 Floor Action
5 S50-10. Attendance -- mandatory voting -- quorum. (1) Unless excused by the President, majority
6 leader, or minority leader, Senators must be physically present every sitting of the Senate and shall vote on
7 questions put before the Senate.

9 adjourn from day to day and compel the attendance of absent Senators, in the manner and under penalties as
10 the Senate may prescribe (Montana Constitution, Art. V, sec. 10(2)).
11 S50-20. Orders of business. After prayer, roll call, and report on the journal, the order of business of

28 or question under debate, in which case the Senator may speak twice and also close the debate. However, a

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Forrest Mandeville - (S) Rules
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0001.001.001
1 Senator who has spoken may not speak again on the same motion or question to the exclusion of a Senator
2 who has not spoken.
3 S50-40. Procedure upon offering a motion. (1) When a motion is offered it must be restated by the
4 presiding officer. If requested by the presiding officer or a Senator, it must be reduced to writing, presented at
5 the rostrum, and read aloud by the Secretary.
6 (2) A motion may be withdrawn by the Senator offering it at any time before it is amended or voted
7 upon.
8 (3) A motion is carried by a majority of the Senate present and voting unless otherwise stated in the
9 Senate Rules.
10 S50-50. Precedence of motions. (1) When a question is under debate only the following privileged
11 and subsidiary motions may be made:
12 (a) to adjourn for the day (nondebatable S50-60);
13 (b) to adjourn sine die (debatable S50-135);
14 (c) for a call of the Senate (nondebatable S50-60);
15 (d) to recess (nondebatable S50-60);
16 (e) question of privilege;
17 (f) to lay on the table (nondebatable S50-60);
18 (g) for the previous question (nondebatable S50-60);

24 and voting on second reading.
25 (2) The motions listed in subsection (1) have precedence in the order listed.
26 (3) Subject to subsection (1)(l), a question may be indefinitely postponed by a majority roll call of all
27 Senators physically or remotely present and voting. When a bill or resolution is postponed indefinitely after
28 debate on second reading, it is finally rejected and may not be acted upon again except upon a motion of
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – SR 1

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Forrest Mandeville - (S) Rules
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0001.001.001
1 reconsideration as provided in S50-90.
2 (4) A motion or proposition on a subject different from that under consideration may not be accepted
3 unless a substitute motion is in order.
4 S50-60. Nondebatable motions. The following motions are not debatable:
5 (1) to adjourn for the day;
6 (2) for a call of the Senate;
7 (3) to recess or rise;
8 (4) for parliamentary inquiry;
9 (5) for suspension of the rules;
10 (6) to lay on the table;
11 (7) for the previous question;
12 (8) to limit, extend the limits of, or to close debate;
13 (9) to amend an undebatable motion;
14 (10) to change a vote (S50-200);
15 (11) to pass business in Committee of the Whole;
16 (12) to take from the table;
17 (13) a decision of the presiding officer, unless appealed or unless the presiding officer submits the
18 question to the Senate for advice or decision; and
19 (14) all incidental motions, such as motions relating to voting or other questions of a general procedural
20 nature.
21 S50-70. Amending motions -- restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (2), no more than one
22 amendment and no more than one substitute motion may be made to a motion. This rule permits the main
23 motion and two modifying motions.
24 (2) A motion for a call of the Senate, for the previous question, to table, or to take from the table may
25 not be amended.
26 S50-80. Previous question. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the effect of calling for the
27 previous question, if adopted, is to close debate immediately, to prevent the offering of amendments or other
28 subsidiary motions, and to bring to vote promptly the immediately pending main question and the adhering
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – SR 1

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Forrest Mandeville - (S) Rules
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0001.001.001
1 subsidiary motions, whether on appeal or otherwise. The motion for the previous question is nondebatable as
2 provided in S50-60(7).
3 (2) When the previous question is ordered on any debatable question on which there has been no
4 debate, the question may be debated for one-half hour, one-half of that time to be given to the proponents and
5 one-half to the opponents. The sponsor of the main motion on which the previous question is adopted may
6 close on the motion regardless of whether debate on the main motion has occurred.
7 (3) A call of the Senate is not in order after the previous question is ordered unless it appears upon an
8 actual count by the presiding officer that a quorum is not physically and remotely present.
9 S50-90. Reconsideration -- time restrictions. (1) Subject to subsection (6), any Senator may, on the
10 day the vote was taken or on the next day the Senate is in session, move to reconsider the question. A motion
11 to reconsider is a debatable motion, but the debate is limited to the motion. The debate on a motion to
12 reconsider may not address the substance of the matter for which reconsideration is sought. However, an
13 inquiry may be made concerning the purpose of the motion to reconsider.
14 (2) A motion to reconsider must be disposed of when made unless a proper substitute motion is made
15 and adopted.
16 (3) A motion to recall a bill from the House of Representatives constitutes notice to reconsider and must
17 be acted on as a motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider or to recall a bill from the House of
18 Representatives may be made only under Order of Business No. 9 and, under that order of business, takes
19 precedence over all motions except motions to recess or adjourn.
20 (4) When a motion to reconsider is laid on the table, a two-thirds majority is required to take it from the
21 table. When a motion to reconsider fails, the question is finally and conclusively settled.
22 (5) If a motion to reconsider third reading action is carried, there may not be further action until the
23 succeeding legislative day.
24 (6) If the Senate has adjourned for more than 2 days, then a motion to reconsider action taken on the
25 last day the Senate was in session is in order on the day the Senate reconvenes or on the following legislative
26 day.
27 S50-95. Rereferral. (1) Legislation that is in the possession of the Senate and that has been reported
28 from a committee with a do pass or be concurred in recommendation may be rereferred to a Senate committee
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SR 1

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Forrest Mandeville - (S) Rules
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0001.001.001
1 by a majority vote.
2 (2) (a) With the consent of the majority leader, the minority leader, and the bill sponsor, legislation that
3 has passed second reading, has been rereferred to the Finance and Claims Committee pursuant to subsection
4 (1), and is reported from committee without amendments may be placed on third reading.
5 (b) The third-reading agenda must specify that the legislation rereferred and reported from committee
6 under subsection (2)(a) was rereferred to the Senate Finance and Claims Committee and reported from the
7 committee without amendments as passed on second reading.
8 (3) The individual making the rereferral motion shall announce the bill number, short bill title, and the
9 name of the sponsor of the bill immediately before it may be considered for rereferral.
10 S50-100. Dividing a question -- segregation excluded. A Senator may request to divide a question if
11 it includes two or more propositions so distinct in substance that if one thing is taken away a substantive
12 question will remain. A vote is not required on a request to divide a question, but the chair may rule that a
13 question is not divisible. The ruling of the chair may be appealed as provided in S20-10 and S20-20. For an
14 appeal of a ruling of the presiding officer, the question for the Senate must be stated as, "Shall the ruling of the
15 chair be upheld?". A motion to segregate pursuant to S50-140(4) is not a request to divide a question.
16 S50-110. Rules for questions or bills requiring other than a majority vote. (1) Except as provided
17 in subsection (2), if a question or bill requires more than a majority vote for final passage, a majority vote is
18 sufficient to decide any question relating to the question or bill prior to third reading.
19 (2) Any vote in the Senate on a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana Constitution under
20 circumstances in which there exists the mathematical possibility of obtaining the necessary two-thirds vote of
21 the Legislature will cause the bill to progress as though it had received the majority vote. This rule does not
22 prevent a committee from indefinitely postponing or tabling a bill proposing an amendment to the Montana
23 Constitution.
24 (3) If a bill has been amended in the House of Representatives and the amendments are accepted by
25 the Senate, the bill must again be placed on third reading in the Senate to determine if the required number of
26 votes has been cast.
27 S50-120. Committee reports to Senate -- reconsideration. (1) Reports of standing committees must
28 be read on Order of Business No. 2, and, if there is no objection to form, are considered adopted. Subject to
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SR 1

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Forrest Mandeville - (S) Rules
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0001.001.001
1 subsection (4), debate may not be had on any report.
2 (2) On an adverse committee report, the sponsor may respond to the chair of the committee making the
3 report.
4 (3) Any Senator seeking a reconsideration of the Senate's action on the adoption of a committee report
5 shall do so on Order of Business No. 9 by motion to reconsider as provided in S50-90. Any Senator may make
6 the reconsideration motion and need not have voted on the prevailing side. This rule applies notwithstanding
7 any joint rule to the contrary. Subject to S50-90(6), the reconsideration motion must be made within 1 legislative
8 day of the adoption of the committee report and is not in order if the bill has been considered in Committee of
9 the Whole.
10 (4) (a) Subject to subsection (4)(b), the Rules Committee and conference committees may report at any
11 time, except during a call of the Senate, when a vote is being taken, or during Committee of the Whole.
12 (b) The Rules Committee may report during Committee of the Whole on matters referred to the
13 Committee by the Committee of the Whole.
14 S50-130. Conference committee -- reports. (1) When a conference committee report is filed with the
15 Secretary of the Senate, the report must be read under Order of Business No. 3, select committees, and placed
16 on the calendar the succeeding legislative day for consideration on second reading. If recommended favorably
17 by the Committee of the Whole, it may be considered on third reading the same legislative day.
18 (2) If both the Senate and the House of Representatives adopt the same conference committee report
19 on legislation requiring more than a majority vote for final passage, the Senate, following approval of the
20 conference committee report on third reading, shall place the final form of the legislation on third reading to
21 determine if the required vote is obtained.
22 (3) If the Senate rejects a conference committee report, the committee continues to exist unless
23 dissolved by the President or by motion. The committee may file a subsequent report.
24 (4) A Senate conference committee may confer regarding matters assigned to it with any House
25 conference committee with like jurisdiction and submit recommendations for consideration of the Senate.
26 S50-135. Adjournment sine die. (1) Subject to Article V, section 10(5), of the Montana Constitution, a
27 Senator may move that the Senate adjourn for the session.
28 (2) (a) The motion is debatable and may be made under any order of business except Order of
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – SR 1

1 Business No. 7.
2 (b) Debate on the motion is limited to two proponents and two opponents.
3 S50-140. Second reading -- Committee of the Whole report -- segregation -- rejection. (1) The
4 Senate may resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole for consideration of business on second reading, by
5 approval of a motion for that purpose.
6 (2) After a Committee of the Whole has been formed, the President shall appoint a chair to preside.
7 (3) All legislation considered in the Committee of the Whole must be read by a summary of its title. The
8 sponsor shall make an opening statement, proposed amendments must be considered, and then the bill must
9 be considered in its entirety.
10 (4) Prior to adoption of the Committee of the Whole report, a Senator may move to segregate
11 legislation. If the motion prevails, the legislation remains on second reading.
12 (5) When a Committee of the Whole report on legislation is rejected, the legislation remains on second
13 reading.
14 S50-150. Committee of the Whole amendments. (1) All Committee of the Whole amendments must
15 be prepared by the staff of the Legislative Services Division, stipulating the date and time of preparation and
16 staff approval, and delivered to the Secretary of the Senate for reading before the amendment is voted on.
17 (2) Each amendment, rejected or adopted, must be referenced in the journal, along with the name of
18 the sponsor and the vote on each.
19 S50-160. Motions in Committee of the Whole. (1) All proper motions on second reading are
20 debatable unless specified in S50-60.
21 (2) The only motions in order during Committee of the Whole are to:
22 (a) recommend passage or nonpassage;
23 (b) recommend concurrence or nonconcurrence (House amendments to Senate legislation);
24 (c) amend;

6 (4) Except for the President of the Senate or designee, a Senator may not be recognized between the
7 time a bill sponsor closes on the bill and the question is called by the presiding officer with a vote taken on the
8 bill or resolution.
9 S50-170. Committee of the Whole -- generally. (1) The Committee of the Whole may not appoint
10 subcommittees.
11 (2) The Committee of the Whole may not punish its members for misconduct, but may report disorder
12 to the Senate.
13 S50-180. Voting on second reading -- positive disposition of motions. (1) On Order of Business
14 No. 7, in addition to other methods, a recorded vote may be made in the following manner: the chair may call
15 for a voice vote to accept or reject a question. If the vote is other than unanimous, the chair may ask that the
16 lesser number on the question indicate their vote by an approved method of counting votes. The Secretary will
17 then record the vote. The chair may then rule that unless excused those of the greater number and physically
18 or remotely present have voted on the prevailing side of the question and that their vote be recorded as voting
19 on the prevailing side. If there was a unanimous voice vote, all those physically or remotely present will be
20 recorded as having voted for the question.

11 the vote. The Senator making the motion shall first specify the bill number, the date of the vote, and the original
12 vote tally. A vote may not be changed if it would affect the outcome of legislation. The motion is nondebatable.
13 If none of the Senators physically or remotely present object, the change must be entered into the journal.

15 suspend the rules to allow the Senator to change the Senator's vote.

69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0001.001.001

15 CHAPTER 7
16 Nominations from the Governor
17 S70-10. Nominations -- second term reappointments. (1) The Governor shall nominate and, by and

1 received from the Governor must be:
2 (a) received by the President;
3 (b) delivered to the Secretary of the Senate; and
4 (c) read under Order of Business No. 4, messages from the Governor.
5 (2) The Secretary shall distribute a copy of the list of nominations and renominations to each Senator.
6 (3) (a) The President of the Senate shall submit a bill draft request for a resolution for each nominee or
7 each group of nominees read under Order of Business No. 4. These bill draft requests will not count against
8 any bill draft request limit imposed on the President of the Senate.
9 (b) Prior to introduction of the resolution, the President of the Senate shall designate the appropriate
10 committee chair or other member of the Senate to introduce the simple resolution.
11 S70-30. Committee process -- separate consideration. (1) (a) The committee shall research each
12 nominee and may request biographical information from the Governor for each nominee if none has been
13 provided.
14 (b) When the resolution has been prepared and introduced, the committee shall hold a hearing on the
15 resolution after appropriate public notice has been given.
16 (2) (a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), following the hearings for a group of nominees, the
17 committee shall issue standing committee reports to be considered on second reading, stating the committee's
18 recommendations concerning the nominees.
19 (b) Following the hearings for the group of nominees, if a committee member wishes to have an
20 individual nominee or group of nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees
21 being considered by the committee, the committee member may prepare an amendment for executive action to
22 strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a group of nominees is stricken, the committee
23 member that offered the amendment shall make a motion to request a committee resolution for the nominee or
24 nominees to be considered by a separate resolution. A simple majority of the committee is sufficient in order to
25 request a separate committee resolution.
26 (3) Within the Committee of the Whole, if a Senator wishes to have an individual nominee or group of
27 nominees considered by the Senate separately from the group of nominees recommended by the committee,
28 the Senator may prepare a floor amendment to strike or add a nominee or group of nominees. If a nominee or a

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Forrest Mandeville - (S) Rules
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, SR0001.001.001
1 group of nominees is stricken, a Senator may make a motion to request that the President of the Senate submit
2 a bill draft request for that the nominee or nominees to be considered by a separate resolution.
3 (4) When the resolution for an individual or group nomination has been prepared and introduced, the
4 committee shall take executive action on the resolution. When a hearing on the separated nomination was held
5 prior to the committee's standing committee report, an additional hearing is not required to be held before the
6 committee takes action on the separate resolution. After the committee's executive action, the committee chair
7 shall issue a standing committee report.
8 (5) The Secretary will read the reports under Order of Business No. 2, reports of standing committees.
9 (6) After the report has been read, the resolution must be placed on Order of Business No. 7 the next
10 legislative day for consideration by the Senate. Motions to approve or disapprove of the resolution are in order
11 and may be debated. Approval upon second reading constitutes confirmation of the Governor's nominee. A
12 motion to reconsider the approval or disapproval of a nomination made on second reading must occur within
13 one legislative day. A motion to reconsider may not be made if the resolution approving a confirmation is no
14 longer in the possession of the Senate.
15 (7) Once the Senate adjourns sine die, all nominations and renominations that were not approved by
16 the Senate are treated as rejected confirmations.
