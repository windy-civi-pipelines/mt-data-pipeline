accepted, the board shall submit to the election administrator a written report stating how many ballots were
missing or in excess and any reason of which they are aware for the discrepancy. Each judge on the board
shall sign the report.

canvassers describing the investigation process and the reason for the discrepancy.
(4) A ballot that is not marked as official is void and may not be counted unless all judges on the
board agree that the marking is missing because of an error by election officials, in which case the ballot must
be marked "unmarked by error" on the back and must be initialed by all judges.
(5) If two or more ballots are folded or stuck together to look like a single ballot, they must be laid
aside until the count is complete. The counting board shall compare the count with the pollbooks record of
accepted ballots, and if a majority believes that the ballots folded together were marked by one elector, the
ballots must be rejected and handled as provided in 13-15-108, otherwise they must be counted.
(6) Only valid absentee ballots may be counted in an election conducted under this chapter.
(7) For the purpose of this chapter, a marked absentee ballot is valid only if:

13-241; and
(b) it is received before 8 p.m. on election day, except as provided in 13-21-206 and 13-21-226.
(8) (a) A ballot is invalid if:
(i) problems with the ballot have not been resolved pursuant to 13-13-245;
(ii) any identifying marks are placed on the ballot by the elector, which must result in the
immediate rejection of the ballot without notice to the elector; or
(iii) except as provided in subsection (8)(b), more than one ballot is enclosed in a single signature
or secrecy envelope.
(b) The provisions of subsection (8)(a)(iii) do not apply if:
(i) there are multiple elections being held at the same time and the envelope contains only one
ballot for each election; or
(ii) the signature envelope contains ballots from the same household, each ballot is in its own
secrecy envelope, and the signature envelope contains a valid signature for each elector who has returned a
ballot."
