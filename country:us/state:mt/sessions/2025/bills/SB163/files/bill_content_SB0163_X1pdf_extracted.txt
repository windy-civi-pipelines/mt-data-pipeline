DATA IN THE SCOPE OF THE GENETIC INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT; ADDING LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS
AND PURPOSE TO THE ACT; REVISING PROVISIONS RELATING TO EXCEPTIONS; ADDING
PROTECTIONS FOR THE PRIVACY OF NEUROTECHNOLOGY DATA; REVISING PROVISIONS RELATING
TO PRIVACY NOTICES; PROVIDING A DEFINITION; AND AMENDING SECTIONS 30-23-101, 30-23-102,
30-23-103, 30-23-104, 30-23-105, AND 44-6-104, MCA.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:

Section 2:
Section 1. Section 30-23-101, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-23-101. Short title -- legislative findings and declaration of purpose. (1) This part may be
cited as the "Genetic Information Privacy Act".
(2) The legislature finds and declares that:
(a) (i) the people of Montana regard their privacy as a fundamental right and an essential element
of individual freedom; and
(ii) Article II, section 10, of the Montana constitution protects individuals' privacy, and fundamental
privacy rights have long been, and continue to be, integral to protecting Montanans;
(b) ongoing advances in technology have produced exponential growth in the volume and variety
of personal data being generated, collected, stored, and analyzed, and these advances present both great
promise and potential risks;
(c) technology that collects data about the user's bodily and mental functions is transforming the
volume and sensitivity of personal data collected from individuals and stored by companies;
(d) neurotechnologies, including devices capable of recording, interpreting, and altering the
response of an individual's central or peripheral nervous system to its internal or external environment, raise

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 163
particularly pressing privacy concerns given their ability to monitor, decode, and manipulate brain activity;
(e) data concerning the activity of the human brain and wider nervous systems, or
"neurotechnology data", is extremely sensitive and can reveal intimate information about individuals, including
information about health, mental states, emotions, and cognitive functioning;
(f) each human brain is unique, meaning that neural data is specific to the individual from whom it
is collected. Because neurotechnology data contains distinctive information about the structure and functioning
of individual brains and nervous systems, it contains sensitive information that may link the data to an identified
or identifiable individual.
(g) the collection of neurotechnology data involves the involuntary disclosure of information. Even
if individuals consent to the collection and processing of their data for narrow use, they are unlikely to be fully
aware of the content or quality of information they are sharing.
(h) neurotechnology users cannot decide what specific neurotechnology information they would
like to disclose, and they are unlikely to understand the extent to which their neurotechnology data can be
decoded, currently or in the future. Neurotechnologies can collect and process information about an individual
that the individual did not even know existed.
(i) neurotechnologies that are deployed in medical settings or otherwise utilize the surgical
implantation of invasive devices are typically regulated as medical tools that produce health information. Both
invasive and noninvasive wearable neurotechnologies used in medical settings are also regulated by health
data privacy laws. However, when noninvasive neurotechnologies are used outside of medical settings, they
are generally considered consumer products and operate without regulation or data protection standards."

Section 3:
Section 2. Section 30-23-102, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-23-102. Definitions. As used in this part, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the

neurotechnology data, which at a minimum must:
(i) be in accordance with the good clinical practice guideline issued by the international council for
harmonisation of technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use;
(ii) be obtained no sooner than 14 days from the initial biological sample collection if the biological
sample is collected for a primary purpose unrelated to clinical research;

(iv) be in writing on a form with text that is easily readable with size 12-point font or larger;
(v) include the entity's biological sample and data retention, sharing, and use policies;
(vi) include notice that after consent is given, there is no right to access, inspect, or require the
destruction of any genetic or neural biological sample or neurotechnology data; and
(vii) include notice that after consent is given, whole genome sequencing of the individual's
biological sample could occur and is permitted without further notice to the individual;
(b) the genetic or neural biological sample and data is utilized for clinical research purposes only.
(8) The requirements of subsection (6)(d) must be temporarily waived if:
(a) a laboratory is governed under 42 CFR 493.1105;
(b) the laboratory retains the biological sample for no more than 2 years or the shortest time

69th Legislature 2025 SB 163
allowed under law, whichever is less;
(c) the laboratory does not share, test, or conduct additional analysis or research on the biological
sample while the sample is being held under the retention requirements set forth in 42 CFR 493.1105 prior to
the requested destruction of the sample; and
(d) when a clinical laboratory is certified by the centers for medicare and medicaid services, when
the retention of a patient's biological sample does not exceed the time needed for compliance with any quality
standard or regulation issued pursuant to section 263(a) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 263(a).
(9) The requirements of subsection (7) supersede all exceptions to, and waivers of, informed
consent in the federal policy for the protection of human subjects under 45 CFR, part 46.
(7)(10) Genetic or neurotechnology data and biometric samples of Montana residents collected in the
state may not be stored within the territorial boundaries of any country currently sanctioned in any way by the
United States office of foreign asset control or designated as a foreign adversary under 15 CFR 7.4(a). Genetic

cause; or
(b) unless the consumer whose information is sought previously waived the consumer's right to
privacy in the information.
(2) A government entity may not obtain familial DNA or neurotechnology data search results or
search results from partial matching from the DNA or neurotechnology identification index or a consumer DNA
or neurotechnology database without a search warrant or investigative subpoena issued by a court on a finding
of probable cause.
(3) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(a) "Consumer DNA database" means a database maintained by a private entity that provides
direct-to-consumer genetic testing services.
(b) "DNA identification index" has the same meaning provided in 44-6-101.
(c) "Familial DNA search" means a search performed of a government or consumer DNA database
using specialized software to detect and statistically rank a list of potential candidates in the DNA database who
may be a close biological relative to the unknown individual contributing the evidence DNA profile. The
specialized software search may be combined with lineage testing to help confirm or refute biological
relatedness.
(d) "Lineage testing" means additional genetic testing used to help confirm or refute biological
relatedness between the known individual in a DNA database and the unknown individual contributing the
evidence DNA profile. Examples of additional genetic testing include but are not limited to:
(i) Y-STR analysis to examine STR patterns specific to the Y-chromosome used to determine
paternally derived relatedness among DNA profiles;
(ii) mtDNA analysis to examine cell mitochondria used to determine maternally derived
relatedness; or
(iii) single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping to generate results related to a person's ancestry
and genetic predisposition to health-related topics.
(e) "Neurotechnology data" has the same meaning as provided in 30-23-102.
(e)(f) "Partial matching" means a moderate stringency search of a DNA database using routine
search parameters that results in one or more partial matches between single-source and nondegraded DNA

profiles that share at least one allele at each locus, indicating a potential familial relationship between the
known individual in the DNA database and the unknown individual contributing the evidence DNA profile.
(4) A government entity that legally obtains DNA or neurotechnology data search results, as set
forth in this section, or genetic or neurotechnology data, as set forth in Title 30, chapter 23, part 1, may use the
results during criminal investigations and judicial proceedings subject to applicable rules of criminal procedure
and evidence."
