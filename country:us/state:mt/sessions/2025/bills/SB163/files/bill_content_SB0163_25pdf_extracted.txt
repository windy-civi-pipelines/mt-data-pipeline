4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT REVISING THE GENETIC INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT;
5 INCLUDING NEURAL NEUROTECHNOLOGY DATA IN THE SCOPE OF THE GENETIC INFORMATION
6 PRIVACY ACT; ADDING LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE TO THE ACT; REVISING PROVISIONS
7 RELATING TO EXCEPTIONS; ADDING PROTECTIONS FOR THE PRIVACY OF NEURAL

12 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
13
14 Section 1. Section 30-23-101, MCA, is amended to read:
15 "30-23-101. Short title -- legislative findings and declaration of purpose. (1) This part may be
16 cited as the "Genetic Information Privacy Act".
17 (2) The legislature finds and declares that:
18 (a) (i) the people of Montana regard their privacy as a fundamental right and an essential element
19 of individual freedom; and
20 (ii) Article II, section 10, of the Montana constitution protects individuals' privacy, and fundamental
21 privacy rights have long been, and continue to be, integral to protecting Montanans;
22 (b) ongoing advances in technology have produced exponential growth in the volume and variety
23 of personal data being generated, collected, stored, and analyzed, and these advances present both great
24 promise and potential risks;
25 (c) technology that collects data about the user's bodily and mental functions is transforming the
26 volume and sensitivity of personal data collected from individuals and stored by companies;
27 (d) neurotechnologies, including devices capable of recording, interpreting, and altering the
28 response of an individual's central or peripheral nervous system to its internal or external environment, raise
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – SB 163

69th Legislature 2025 SB0163.2
1 particularly pressing privacy concerns given their ability to monitor, decode, and manipulate brain activity;
2 (e) data concerning the activity of the human brain and wider nervous systems, or "neural
3 NEUROTECHNOLOGY data", is extremely sensitive and can reveal intimate information about individuals, including
4 information about health, mental states, emotions, and cognitive functioning;
5 (f) each human brain is unique, meaning that neural data is specific to the individual from whom it
6 is collected. Because neural NEUROTECHNOLOGY data contains distinctive information about the structure and
7 functioning of individual brains and nervous systems, it contains sensitive information that may link the data to
8 an identified or identifiable individual.
9 (g) the collection of neural NEUROTECHNOLOGY data involves the involuntary disclosure of
10 information. Even if individuals consent to the collection and processing of their data for narrow use, they are
11 unlikely to be fully aware of the content or quality of information they are sharing.
12 (h) neurotechnology users cannot decide what specific neural NEUROTECHNOLOGY information they
13 would like to disclose, and they are unlikely to understand the extent to which their neural NEUROTECHNOLOGY
14 data can be decoded, currently or in the future. Neurotechnologies can collect and process information about
15 an individual that the individual did not even know existed.
16 (i) neurotechnologies that are deployed in medical settings or otherwise utilize the surgical
17 implantation of invasive devices are typically regulated as medical tools that produce health information. Both
18 invasive and noninvasive wearable neurotechnologies used in medical settings are also regulated by health
19 data privacy laws. However, when noninvasive neurotechnologies are used outside of medical settings, they
20 are generally considered consumer products and operate without regulation or data protection standards."

22 Section 2. Section 30-23-102, MCA, is amended to read:
