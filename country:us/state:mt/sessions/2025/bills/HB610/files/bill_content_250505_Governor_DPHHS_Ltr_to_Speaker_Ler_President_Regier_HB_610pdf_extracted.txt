Dear Governor Gianforte,
I write to share the Department of Public Health and Human Services’s (DPHHS)
concerns with House Bill 610, “Revise preauthorization laws relating to healthcare,”
sponsored by Representative Kerri Seekins-Crowe. DPHHS shares the sponsor’s desire to
ensure Medicaid members have access to necessary behavioral health services and
supports. However, DPHHS seeks to achieve this goal while also ensuring that the State
responsibly stewards the resources of the Medicaid program which represent the tax
dollars of hardworking Montanans.
While House Bill 610 intends to increase access to antipsychotic drugs, eliminating the
authority to require prior authorization for such drugs limits DPHHS’s ability to effectively
manage this drug class within the Medicaid program.
DPHHS, in consultation with the Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Board – comprised of five
pharmacists, four physicians, a mid-level practitioner, and a citizen’s advocate, with
varying specialties including psychiatry – establishes a cost-effective Preferred Drug List
(PDL) to ensure access to clinically effective and safe drugs. The DUR Board reviews
each PDL drug class annually, and notably, has not recommended eliminating prior
authorization for antipsychotics.
All DUR Board meetings are public, providing an open, transparent opportunity for
advocacy groups, the public, providers, and pharmaceutical manufacturer representatives
to voice their concerns, advocate for the placement of drugs on, or removal of drugs
from, the PDL, etc., verbally or in writing. The DUR Board can consider public input when
providing recommendations to DPHHS on the PDL. And should the DUR Board wish to
further discuss a concern raised by public comment, it can request that it be added as an
agenda item for a future meeting.
Prior authorization, combined with use of the PDL, does not restrict access. Instead, it
promotes cost-effectiveness by prioritizing the use of less expensive, equally efficacious
drugs before authorizing coverage of more expensive, equally efficacious alternatives,
unless a contraindication exists. Prior authorization is a standard health care industry
tool used to control costs and ensure beneficiaries receive clinically and cost-appropriate
PAGE 1
medication and services. On behalf of Montana Medicaid, prior authorizations are
conducted by medical professionals employed by a contractor of DPHHS.
As demonstrated in our fiscal note, DPHHS estimates the implementation of House Bill
610 will increase Medicaid pharmacy expenditures by $18,304,995 in SFY 2026. Over
$4.8 million of the increased expenditures will be drawn from the state’s general fund.
The financial impact of this bill could strain the Medicaid budget and, by extension, place
an undue burden on Montana taxpayers.
It is essential to emphasize that eliminating prior authorization would be a virtually
irreversible decision, potentially leading to long-term financial challenges for the Medicaid
program. Once a beneficiary is stabilized on a particular antipsychotic, Medicaid would
not require a switch to another medication due to risk of destabilizing the beneficiary's
mental health. This means DPHHS would remain obligated to cover the initial, potentially
higher cost drug, even if prior authorization is reinstated. Prior authorization
reinstatements would only apply to newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries, thereby
maintaining the higher drug costs experienced by beneficiaries already on unnecessarily
higher cost medications at the time that a prior authorization reinstatement would occur.
This is especially concerning, given rising prescription drug costs and the federal
regulation requiring Medicaid to cover all FDA-approved drugs with a valid drug rebate
agreement. The future cost of antipsychotic medications is unpredictable and without
prior authorization, DPHHS would be required to pay for significantly more expensive
medications even when lower cost, equally effective alternatives are available.
DPHHS remains steadfastly committed to ensuring that the Montanans served by our
Medicaid program have access to necessary behavioral health services and supports,
including antipsychotic drugs. However, DPHHS must also be a responsible steward of
the taxpayer dollars that allow Medicaid to exist. House Bill 610 would eliminate the
longstanding flexibility leveraged by DPHHS to effectively manage antipsychotics as a
drug class in the Medicaid program, thereby driving health care costs even higher. House
Bill 610’s elimination of this important flexibility, as well as its projected fiscal impact and
circumvention of established controls to manage Montana Medicaid drug costs, warrants
its veto.
Sincerely,
/s/ Charles T. Brereton
