23 safety, and welfare controlled ground water area to allow studies to obtain the facts needed to determine
24 whether or not it is appropriate to designate a permanent controlled ground water area. The department shall
25 set the length of time that the temporary controlled ground water area will be in effect. Subject to subsection (6)

2 rulemaking
3 (8) (a) The department shall designate or modify a water quantity controlled ground water area by
4 rule if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a high concentration of ground water use exempt
5 from permitting pursuant to 85-2-306(4), and the department determines:
6 (i) the ground water level is declining or is projected to decline due to pumping based on a review
7 of the most recent 10-year period of record that demonstrates a chronic lowering of the ground water table or
8 permanent loss of aquifer storage. This review must be based on available data or in consultation with the
9 Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies;
10 (ii) that 80% or more of the ground water in the aquifer has been appropriated; or
11 (iii) that 100% or more of the hydraulically connected surface water has been appropriated during
12 any month. Ground water that is hydrologically connected to surface water is all ground water that, if extracted,
13 may cause stream depletion by induced infiltration or pre-stream capture of tributary ground water.
14 (b) Control provisions for a water quantity controlled ground water area must include but are not
15 limited to:
16 (i) closing the water quantity controlled ground water area to all exceptions from the permitting
17 process pursuant to 85-2-306, except for those specific appropriations authorized by rule pursuant to this
18 section;
19 (ii) requiring metering and reporting for all new water rights and authorizations pursuant to 85-2-
20 306, 85-2-311, and 85-2-402 in water quantity controlled ground water areas. A totalizing metering device must
21 be used and measurements must be reported annually on a form provided by the department. The department
22 may issue a fine for noncompliance with this metering and reporting requirement;
23 (iii) allowing for the completion of appropriations on parcels created after October 17, 2014, that
24 received a certificate of subdivision approval from the department of environmental quality and a
25 predetermination letter from the department of natural resources and conservation before February 14, 2024;
26 (iv) closing an aquifer area to all exceptions from the permitting process pursuant to 85-2-306,

8 rule if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a high concentration of ground water use exempt
9 from permitting pursuant to 85-2-306(4), and the department:
10 (i) determines the ground water level is declining or is projected to decline due to pumping based
11 on a review of the most recent 10-year period of record that demonstrates a chronic lowering of the ground
12 water table or permanent loss of aquifer storage. This review must be based on available data or in consultation
13 with the Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies.
14 (ii) determines that 70% or more of the ground water in the aquifer has been appropriated;
15 (iii) determines that aquifer recharge is reliant on irrigation losses or where the geologic structure
16 or formation has limited storage or limited storage potential based on available data or in consultation with the
17 Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies; or
18 (iv) determines that 90% or more of the hydraulically connected surface water has been
19 appropriated during any month.
20 (b) (i)Control provisions for water quantity ground water monitoring areas must include but are not
21 limited to:
22 (A) requiring the department to develop a monitoring plan for each designated ground water
23 monitoring area in consultation with the Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies;
24 (B) requiring metering and reporting for all new water rights and authorizations pursuant to 85-2-
25 306, 85-2-311, and 85-2-402 in water quantity ground water monitoring areas. A totalizing metering device must
26 be used and measurements must be reported annually on a form provided by the department. The department

2 each biennium to determine if a change in area status is necessary.
3 (10) (a) The department shall designate or modify a water quality controlled ground water area by
4 rule if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that using site-specific data, 50% of the designated area is
5 classified as high septic system density, as defined in department circular PWS 6 from the department of
6 environmental quality, and one of these criteria is met:
7 (i) nitrate concentrations exceed standards in department circular DEQ-7, department circular
8 DEQ-12A, or department circular DEQ-4 from the department of environmental quality;

14 (I) aquatic life or recreation beneficial uses of the connected surface water are listed as impaired
15 by the department of environmental quality pursuant to Title 75, chapter 5; and
16 (II) impaired by total nitrogen or total phosphorus attributable to on-site subsurface wastewater
17 treatment and disposal systems sources at a source contribution rate equal to or greater than 10%; or

19 quality, the petitioner may provide substantial credible data and analysis conducted in accordance with water
20 quality assessment methods prescribed by the department of environmental quality to demonstrate an
21 impairment:
22 (I) to aquatic life or recreation beneficial uses; and
23 (II) based on total nitrogen or total phosphorous attributable to on-site subsurface wastewater
24 treatment and disposal system sources at a source contribution rate of equal to or greater than 10%.
