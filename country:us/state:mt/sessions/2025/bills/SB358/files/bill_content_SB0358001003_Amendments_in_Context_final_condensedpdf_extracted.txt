8 application for a stock water provisional permit, the department shall automatically issue a provisional permit. If
9 the department determines after a hearing that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely
10 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
11 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
12 of other appropriators.
13 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
14 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
15 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
16 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
17 (c) The purpose of use authorized for a provisional permit pursuant to subsection (9) may not be

1 before February 14, 2024, then the water uses for the subdivision lots and volumes allocated in the
2 predetermination letter define the amount of water allowed without a permit under the exception in this
3 subsection (4) and will count toward the maximum cumulative volume limit in subsection (4)(a)(v)(A)(IV).
4 (b) (i) The water appropriated under subsection (4)(a)(v) must be measured and reported annually
5 to the department. A totalizing metering device must be used and the measurements must be reported annually

7 and reporting requirement.
8 (ii) An appropriation exceeding the amounts or conditions in subsection (4)(a)(v) requires a permit.
9 (iv) when the appropriation is within a stream depletion zone, is 20 gallons a minute or less, and
10 does not exceed 2 acre-feet a year, except that a combined appropriation from the same source by two or more
11 wells or developed springs exceeding this limitation requires a permit.
12 (b)(c) (i) Within 60 days of completion of the well or developed spring and appropriation of the ground
13 water for beneficial use, the appropriator shall file a notice of completion with the department on a form
14 provided by the department through its offices.
15 (ii) Upon receipt of the notice, the department shall review the notice and may, before issuing a
16 certificate of water right, return a defective notice for correction or completion, together with the reasons for
17 returning it. A notice does not lose priority of filing because of defects if the notice is corrected, completed, and
18 refiled with the department within 30 days of notification of defects or within a further time as the department
19 may allow, not to exceed 6 months.
20 (iii) If a notice is not corrected and completed within the time allowed, the priority date of
21 appropriation is the date of refiling a correct and complete notice with the department.
22 (c)(d) A certificate of water right may not be issued until a correct and complete notice has been filed
23 with the department, including proof of landowner notification or a written federal special use authorization as
24 necessary under subsection (1). The original of the certificate must be sent to the appropriator. The department
25 shall keep a copy of the certificate in its office in Helena. The date of filing of the notice of completion is the date
26 of priority of the right.
27 (d)(e) (i) Construction of a water supply system subject to Title 75, chapter 6, part 1, and use of a
28 permit exception for the appropriation of water pursuant to this section is proof of beneficial use.

1 (ii) The department shall allocate a volume of 10 acre-feet a year to the system and issue a
2 certificate of water right after the conditions in subsection (3)(d)(i) (4)(e)(i) are met.
3 (iii) The department shall consider a water right as perfected after the conditions in subsection
4 (3)(d)(i) (4)(e)(i) are met.
5 (iv) When the appropriation is for a water supply system that is subject to Title 75, chapter 6, part 1,
6 and is located outside of a stream depletion zone and does not exceed 10 acre-feet a year:
7 (A) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b)(i) (4)(c)(i), the appropriation will be considered perfected
8 upon completion of construction of the water supply system.
9 (B) A copy of the department of environmental quality approval for the water supply system must
10 be submitted with the notice of completion. This section does not preclude the public water supply developer or
11 any subsequent owners from expanding the water system or from revising the water use restrictions within the
12 subdivision, provided that the total amount does not exceed 10 acre-feet per year.
13 (C) Water appropriated under this exception must be measured and reported annually to the
14 department.
15 (4)(5) An appropriator of ground water by means of a well or developed spring first put to beneficial
16 use between January 1, 1962, and July 1, 1973, who did not file a notice of completion, as required by laws in
17 force prior to April 14, 1981, with the county clerk and recorder shall file a notice of completion, as provided in
18 subsection (3) (4), with the department to perfect the water right. The filing of a claim pursuant to 85-2-221 is
19 sufficient notice of completion under this subsection. The priority date of the appropriation is the date of the
20 filing of a notice, as provided in subsection (3) (4), or the date of the filing of the claim of existing water right.
21 (5)(6) An appropriation under subsection (4) (5) is an existing right, and a permit is not required.
22 However, the department shall acknowledge the receipt of a correct and complete filing of a notice of
23 completion, except that for an appropriation of 35 gallons a minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet a year,
24 the department shall issue a certificate of water right. If a certificate is issued under this section, a certificate
25 need not be issued under the adjudication proceedings provided for in 85-2-236.
26 (6)(7) A permit is not required before constructing an impoundment or pit and appropriating water for
27 use by livestock if:
28 (a) the maximum capacity of the impoundment or pit is less than 15 acre-feet;

1 (b) the appropriation is less than 30 acre-feet a year;
2 (c) the appropriation is from an ephemeral stream, an intermittent stream, or another source other
3 than a perennial flowing stream; and
4 (d) the impoundment or pit is to be constructed on and will be accessible to a parcel of land that is
5 owned or under the control of the applicant and that is 40 acres or larger.
6 (7)(8) (a) Within 60 days after constructing an impoundment or pit, the appropriator shall apply for a
7 permit as prescribed by this part. Subject to subsection (7)(b) (8)(b), upon receipt of a correct and complete
8 application for a stock water provisional permit, the department shall automatically issue a provisional permit. If
9 the department determines after a hearing that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely
10 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
11 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
12 of other appropriators.
13 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
14 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
15 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
16 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
17 (c) The purpose of use authorized for a provisional permit pursuant to subsection (9) may not be
18 changed pursuant to 85-2-402.
19 (8)(9) A person may also appropriate water without applying for or prior to receiving a permit under
20 rules adopted by the department under 85-2-113.
21 (9)(10) Pursuant to 85-20-1902, the provisions of this section do not apply within the exterior
22 boundaries of the Flathead Indian reservation."
