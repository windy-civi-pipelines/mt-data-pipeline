8 (A) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b)(i) (4)(c)(i), the appropriation will be considered perfected
9 upon completion of construction of the water supply system.
10 (B) A copy of the department of environmental quality approval for the water supply system must
11 be submitted with the notice of completion. This section does not preclude the public water supply developer or
12 any subsequent owners from expanding the water system or from revising the water use restrictions within the
13 subdivision, provided that the total amount does not exceed 10 acre-feet per year.
14 (C) Water appropriated under this exception must be measured and reported annually to the

11 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
12 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
13 of other appropriators.
14 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
15 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
16 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
17 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
18 (c) The purpose of use authorized for a provisional permit pursuant to subsection (9) may not be

1 Section 4. Section 85-2-381, MCA, is amended to read:
2 "85-2-381. Water right enforcement of ground water uses exempt from permitting -- findings
3 and purpose. (1) The legislature finds that:
4 (a) the state of Montana has managed the allocation of water under the prior appropriation
5 doctrine for more than 100 years;
6 (b) Article IX, section 3, of the Montana constitution recognizes and confirms all existing water
7 rights;
8 (c) the right to the use of water through a water right is a recognized property right;
9 (d) the development of ground water wells that are exempt from permitting may have an adverse
10 effect on other water rights;
11 (e) the Water Use Act requires the department to coordinate the development and use of the water
12 resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources; and
13 (f) the ability to develop ground water wells that are exempt from permitting contributes to the full
14 utilization of the water resources of the state.
15 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
16 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
17 surface water rights.
18 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
19 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
20 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
21 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
22 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
23 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
24 enforcement according to priority by:
25 (a) any remedy legally available;
26 (b) the department, upon receiving a complaint, through the provisions of 85-2-114 and 85-2-122;
27 or
28 (c) a water commissioner appointed pursuant to 85-5-101.

24 whether or not it is appropriate to designate a permanent controlled ground water area. The department shall
25 set the length of time that the temporary controlled ground water area will be in effect. Subject to subsection (6)

4 rule if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a high concentration of ground water use exempt
5 from permitting pursuant to 85-2-306(4), and the department determines:
6 (i) the ground water level is declining or is projected to decline due to pumping based on a review
7 of the most recent 10-year period of record that demonstrates a chronic lowering of the ground water table or

24 received a certificate of subdivision approval from the department of environmental quality and a
25 predetermination letter from the department of natural resources and conservation before February 14, 2024;
26 (iv) closing an aquifer area to all exceptions from the permitting process pursuant to 85-2-306,
27 except for appropriations pursuant to subsection (8)(b)(iii) or one exception allowing for up to 0.5 acre-feet a
28 year without a permit that is authorized by the department for a single living unit on a tract of record in existence

9 (i) determines the ground water level is declining or is projected to decline due to pumping based
10 on a review of the most recent 10-year period of record that demonstrates a chronic lowering of the ground
11 water table or permanent loss of aquifer storage. This review must be based on available data or in consultation
12 with the Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies.
13 (ii) determines that 70% or more of the ground water in the aquifer has been appropriated;
14 (iii) determines that aquifer recharge is reliant on irrigation losses or where the geologic structure
15 or formation has limited storage or limited storage potential based on available data or in consultation with the
16 Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies; or
17 (iv) determines that 90% or more of the hydraulically connected surface water has been
18 appropriated during any month.
19 (b) (i) Control provisions for water quantity ground water monitoring areas must include but are not
20 limited to:
21 (A) requiring the department to develop a monitoring plan for each designated ground water
22 monitoring area in consultation with the Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies;
23 (B) requiring metering and reporting for all new water rights and authorizations pursuant to 85-2-
24 306, 85-2-311, and 85-2-402 in water quantity ground water monitoring areas. A totalizing metering device must
25 be used and measurements must be reported annually on a form provided by the department. The department
26 may issue a fine for noncompliance with this metering and reporting requirement;
27 (ii) The department shall review the monitoring data and plan provided for in subsection (8)(b)(i)(A)
28 each biennium to determine if a change in area status is necessary.
