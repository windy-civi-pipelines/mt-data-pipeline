19 (a) the state of Montana has managed the allocation of water under the prior appropriation
20 doctrine for more than 100 years;
21 (b) Article IX, section 3, of the Montana constitution recognizes and confirms all existing water
22 rights;
23 (c) the right to the use of water through a water right is a recognized property right;
24 (d) the development of ground water wells that are exempt from permitting may have an adverse
25 effect on other water rights;
26 (e) the Water Use Act requires the department to coordinate the development and use of the water
27 resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources; and
28 (f) the ability to develop ground water wells that are exempt from permitting contributes to the full

1 utilization of the water resources of the state.
2 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
3 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
4 surface water rights.
5 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
6 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
7 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
8 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
9 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
10 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
11 enforcement according to priority by:
12 (a) any remedy legally available;
13 (b) the department, upon receiving a complaint, through the provisions of 85-2-114 and 85-2-122;
14 or
15 (c) a water commissioner appointed pursuant to 85-5-101.

19 (a) the state of Montana has managed the allocation of water under the prior appropriation
20 doctrine for more than 100 years;
21 (b) Article IX, section 3, of the Montana constitution recognizes and confirms all existing water
22 rights;
23 (c) the right to the use of water through a water right is a recognized property right;
24 (d) the development of ground water wells that are exempt from permitting may have an adverse
25 effect on other water rights;
26 (e) the Water Use Act requires the department to coordinate the development and use of the water

1 utilization of the water resources of the state.
2 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
3 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
4 surface water rights.
5 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
6 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
7 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
8 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
9 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
10 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
11 enforcement according to priority by:
12 (a) any remedy legally available;
13 (b) the department, upon receiving a complaint, through the provisions of 85-2-114 and 85-2-122;
14 or
15 (c) a water commissioner appointed pursuant to 85-5-101.

16 (8) (a) The department shall designate or modify a water quantity controlled ground water area by
17 rule if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a high concentration of ground water use exempt
18 from permitting pursuant to 85-2-306(4), and the department determines:
19 (i) the ground water level is declining or is projected to decline due to pumping based on a review
20 of the most recent 10-year period of record that demonstrates a chronic lowering of the ground water table or
21 permanent loss of aquifer storage. This review must be based on available data or in consultation with the
22 Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies;
23 (ii) that 80% or more of the ground water in the aquifer has been appropriated; or
24 (iii) that 100% or more of the hydraulically connected surface water has been appropriated during
25 any month. Ground water that is hydrologically connected to surface water is all ground water that, if extracted,
26 may cause stream depletion by induced infiltration or pre-stream capture of tributary ground water.

9 received a certificate of subdivision approval from the department of environmental quality and a
10 predetermination letter from the department of natural resources and conservation before February 14, 2024;
11 (iv) closing an aquifer area to all exceptions from the permitting process pursuant to 85-2-306,
12 except for appropriations pursuant to subsection (8)(b)(iii) or one exception allowing for up to 0.5 acre-feet a
13 year without a permit that is authorized by the department for a single living unit on a tract of record in existence
14 on January 1, 2025, when connection to a public water system and mitigation is infeasible or for stockwater. A
15 change in the purpose of a water right excepted from permitting pursuant to this subsection (8)(b)(iv) is
16 prohibited;
17 (v) other control provisions the department determines are appropriate and adopts through
18 administrative rule.
19 (9) (a) The department shall designate or modify a water quantity ground water monitoring area by
