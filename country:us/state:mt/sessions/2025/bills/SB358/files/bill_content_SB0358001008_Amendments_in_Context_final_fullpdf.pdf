3 subsection (4) and will count toward the maximum cumulative volume limit in subsection (4)(a)(v)(A)(IV).
4 (b) (i) The water appropriated under subsection (4)(a)(v) must be measured and reported annually
5 semiannually to the department. A totalizing metering device must be used and the measurements must be

14 provided by the department through its offices.
15 (ii) Upon receipt of the notice, the department shall review the notice and may, before issuing a
16 certificate of water right, return a defective notice for correction or completion, together with the reasons for
17 returning it. A notice does not lose priority of filing because of defects if the notice is corrected, completed, and
18 refiled with the department within 30 days of notification of defects or within a further time as the department
19 may allow, not to exceed 6 months.
20 (iii) If a notice is not corrected and completed within the time allowed, the priority date of
21 appropriation is the date of refiling a correct and complete notice with the department.
22 (c)(d) A certificate of water right may not be issued until a correct and complete notice has been filed
23 with the department, including proof of landowner notification or a written federal special use authorization as
24 necessary under subsection (1). The original of the certificate must be sent to the appropriator. The department
25 shall keep a copy of the certificate in its office in Helena. The date of filing of the notice of completion is the date
26 of priority of the right.
27 (d)(e) (i) Construction of a water supply system subject to Title 75, chapter 6, part 1, and use of a
28 permit exception for the appropriation of water pursuant to this section is proof of beneficial use.

7 (A) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b)(i) (4)(c)(i), the appropriation will be considered perfected
8 upon completion of construction of the water supply system.
9 (B) A copy of the department of environmental quality approval for the water supply system must
10 be submitted with the notice of completion. This section does not preclude the public water supply developer or
11 any subsequent owners from expanding the water system or from revising the water use restrictions within the
12 subdivision, provided that the total amount does not exceed 10 acre-feet per year.
13 (C) Water appropriated under this exception must be measured and reported annually to the

20 filing of a notice, as provided in subsection (3) (4), or the date of the filing of the claim of existing water right.
21 (5)(6) An appropriation under subsection (4) (5) is an existing right, and a permit is not required.

9 the department determines after a hearing that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely
10 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
11 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
12 of other appropriators.
13 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
14 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
15 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
16 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
17 (c) The purpose of use authorized for a provisional permit pursuant to subsection (9) may not be

23 (a) the state of Montana has managed the allocation of water under the prior appropriation
24 doctrine for more than 100 years;
25 (b) Article IX, section 3, of the Montana constitution recognizes and confirms all existing water
26 rights;

1 effect on other water rights;
2 (e) the Water Use Act requires the department to coordinate the development and use of the water
3 resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources; and
4 (f) the ability to develop ground water wells that are exempt from permitting contributes to the full
5 utilization of the water resources of the state.
6 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
7 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
8 surface water rights.
9 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
10 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
11 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
12 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
13 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
14 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
15 enforcement according to priority by:
16 (a) any remedy legally available;

3 (iii) serving by mail a copy of the notice upon any other person or state or federal agency that the
4 department feels may be interested in or affected by the proposed designation or modification of a controlled
5 ground water area.
6 (d) The notice under subsection (4)(c) (5)(c) must include a summary of the basis for the proposed

8 sufficient notice of the hearing to all interested persons.
9 (5)(6) (a) The department may designate a permanent public health, safety, and welfare controlled
10 ground water area by rule if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that any of the following criteria have
11 been met and cannot be appropriately mitigated:
12 (a)(i) current or projected reductions of recharge to the aquifer or aquifers in the proposed controlled
13 ground water area will cause ground water levels to decline to the extent that water right holders cannot
14 reasonably exercise their water rights;
15 (b)(ii) current or projected ground water withdrawals from the aquifer or aquifers in the proposed
16 controlled ground water area have reduced or will reduce ground water levels or surface water availability
17 necessary for water right holders to reasonably exercise their water rights;

25 or
26 (f)(vi) public health, safety, or welfare is or will become at risk.

5 (iv) requiring the filing of notice on land records within the boundary of a permanent controlled
6 ground water area to inform prospective holders of an interest in the property of the existence of a permanent

8 accurately reflect the modification or repeal of a permanent designation within 60 days.
9 (v) well spacing requirements, well construction constraints, and prior department approval before
10 well drilling unless the well is regulated pursuant to Title 82, chapter 11;
11 (vi) mitigation of ground water withdrawals;

13 (viii) data reporting to the department; and
14 (ix) other provisions the department determines are appropriate and adopts through rulemaking.
15 (6)(7) (a) If the department finds that sufficient facts are not available to designate a permanent public
16 health, safety, and welfare controlled ground water area, it may designate by rule a temporary public health,
17 safety, and welfare controlled ground water area to allow studies to obtain the facts needed to determine
18 whether or not it is appropriate to designate a permanent controlled ground water area. The department shall
19 set the length of time that the temporary controlled ground water area will be in effect. Subject to subsection (6)
20 (7)(c), the term of a temporary controlled ground water area may be extended by rule.
21 (b) A temporary public health, safety, and welfare controlled ground water area designation is for
22 the purpose of study and cannot include the control provisions provided in subsection (7) (6), other than
23 measurement, water quality testing, and reporting requirements.
24 (c) A temporary public health, safety, and welfare controlled ground water area designation may
25 not exceed a total of 6 years, including any extensions.
26 (d) Prior to expiration of a temporary public health, safety, and welfare controlled ground water
27 area, the department may amend or repeal the rule establishing the temporary controlled ground water area or
28 may designate a permanent controlled ground water area through the rulemaking process under this section.
