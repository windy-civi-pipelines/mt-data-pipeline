19 subdivision, provided that the total amount does not exceed 10 acre-feet per year.
20 (C) Water appropriated under this exception must be measured and reported annually to the

18 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
19 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
20 of other appropriators.
21 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
22 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
23 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
24 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.

2 when the appropriation is outside a stream depletion zone, is 35 gallons a minute or less, and does not exceed
3 10 acre-feet a year, except that a combined appropriation from the same source by two or more wells or
4 developed springs exceeding 10 acre-feet, regardless of the flow rate, requires a permit; or. The department

14 (H) topography;
15 (iv) for a parcel with a certificate of subdivision approval from the department of environmental

5 before October 17, 2014, and received a certificate of subdivision approval from the department of
6 environmental quality and a predetermination letter from the department of natural resources and conservation
7 before February 14, 2024, then the water uses for the subdivision lots and volumes allocated in the
8 predetermination letter define the amount of water allowed without a permit under the exception in this
9 subsection (4) and will count toward the maximum cumulative volume limit in subsection (4)(a)(v)(A)(IV).
10 (b) (i) The water appropriated under subsection (4)(a)(v) must be measured and reported annually

13 and reporting requirement.
14 (ii) An appropriation exceeding the amounts or conditions in subsection (4)(a)(v) requires a permit.
15 (iv) when the appropriation is within a stream depletion zone, is 20 gallons a minute or less, and
16 does not exceed 2 acre-feet a year, except that a combined appropriation from the same source by two or more
17 wells or developed springs exceeding this limitation requires a permit.
18 (b)(c) (i) Within 60 days of completion of the well or developed spring and appropriation of the ground
19 water for beneficial use, the appropriator shall file a notice of completion with the department on a form
20 provided by the department through its offices.
21 (ii) Upon receipt of the notice, the department shall review the notice and may, before issuing a
22 certificate of water right, return a defective notice for correction or completion, together with the reasons for
23 returning it. A notice does not lose priority of filing because of defects if the notice is corrected, completed, and
24 refiled with the department within 30 days of notification of defects or within a further time as the department
25 may allow, not to exceed 6 months.
26 (iii) If a notice is not corrected and completed within the time allowed, the priority date of
27 appropriation is the date of refiling a correct and complete notice with the department.

8 (ii) The department shall allocate a volume of 10 acre-feet a year to the system and issue a
9 certificate of water right after the conditions in subsection (3)(d)(i) (4)(e)(i) are met.
10 (iii) The department shall consider a water right as perfected after the conditions in subsection
11 (3)(d)(i) (4)(e)(i) are met.

14 (A) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b)(i) (4)(c)(i), the appropriation will be considered perfected
15 upon completion of construction of the water supply system.
16 (B) A copy of the department of environmental quality approval for the water supply system must
17 be submitted with the notice of completion. This section does not preclude the public water supply developer or
18 any subsequent owners from expanding the water system or from revising the water use restrictions within the
19 subdivision, provided that the total amount does not exceed 10 acre-feet per year.
20 (C) Water appropriated under this exception must be measured and reported annually to the

1 (5)(6) An appropriation under subsection (4) (5) is an existing right, and a permit is not required.
2 However, the department shall acknowledge the receipt of a correct and complete filing of a notice of
3 completion, except that for an appropriation of 35 gallons a minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet a year,
4 the department shall issue a certificate of water right. If a certificate is issued under this section, a certificate
5 need not be issued under the adjudication proceedings provided for in 85-2-236.
6 (6)(7) A permit is not required before constructing an impoundment or pit and appropriating water for
7 use by livestock if:
8 (a) the maximum capacity of the impoundment or pit is less than 15 acre-feet;
9 (b) the appropriation is less than 30 acre-feet a year;
10 (c) the appropriation is from an ephemeral stream, an intermittent stream, or another source other
11 than a perennial flowing stream; and

15 permit as prescribed by this part. Subject to subsection (7)(b) (8)(b), upon receipt of a correct and complete

17 the department determines after a hearing that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely
18 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
19 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
20 of other appropriators.
21 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
22 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
23 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
24 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
25 (c) The purpose of use authorized for a provisional permit pursuant to subsection (9) may not be
26 changed pursuant to 85-2-402.
27 (8)(9) A person may also appropriate water without applying for or prior to receiving a permit under
