24 received a certificate of subdivision approval from the department of environmental quality and a
25 predetermination letter from the department of natural resources and conservation before February 14, 2024;
26 (iv) closing an aquifer area to all exceptions from the permitting process pursuant to 85-2-306,

11 water table or permanent loss of aquifer storage. This review must be based on available data or in consultation
12 with the Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies.
13 (ii) determines that 70% or more of the ground water in the aquifer has been appropriated;
14 (iii) determines that aquifer recharge is reliant on irrigation losses or where the geologic structure
15 or formation has limited storage or limited storage potential based on available data or in consultation with the
16 Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies; or
