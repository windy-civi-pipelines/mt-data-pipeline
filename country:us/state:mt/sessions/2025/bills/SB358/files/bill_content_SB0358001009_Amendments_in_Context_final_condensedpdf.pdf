2 before October 17, 2014, and received a certificate of subdivision approval from the department of
3 environmental quality and a predetermination letter from the department of natural resources and conservation
4 before February 14, 2024, then the water uses for the subdivision lots and volumes allocated in the
5 predetermination letter define the amount of water allowed without a permit under the exception in this

18 (ii) Upon receipt of the notice, the department shall review the notice and may, before issuing a
19 certificate of water right, return a defective notice for correction or completion, together with the reasons for
20 returning it. A notice does not lose priority of filing because of defects if the notice is corrected, completed, and
21 refiled with the department within 30 days of notification of defects or within a further time as the department
22 may allow, not to exceed 6 months.
23 (iii) If a notice is not corrected and completed within the time allowed, the priority date of
24 appropriation is the date of refiling a correct and complete notice with the department.
25 (c)(d) A certificate of water right may not be issued until a correct and complete notice has been filed
26 with the department, including proof of landowner notification or a written federal special use authorization as
27 necessary under subsection (1). The original of the certificate must be sent to the appropriator. The department
28 shall keep a copy of the certificate in its office in Helena. The date of filing of the notice of completion is the date

7 (3)(d)(i) (4)(e)(i) are met.
8 (iv) When the appropriation is for a water supply system that is subject to Title 75, chapter 6, part 1,
9 and is located outside of a stream depletion zone and does not exceed 10 acre-feet a year:
10 (A) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b)(i) (4)(c)(i), the appropriation will be considered perfected
11 upon completion of construction of the water supply system.
12 (B) A copy of the department of environmental quality approval for the water supply system must
13 be submitted with the notice of completion. This section does not preclude the public water supply developer or
14 any subsequent owners from expanding the water system or from revising the water use restrictions within the
15 subdivision, provided that the total amount does not exceed 10 acre-feet per year.
16 (C) Water appropriated under this exception must be measured and reported annually to the
17 department.
18 (4)(5) An appropriator of ground water by means of a well or developed spring first put to beneficial

20 force prior to April 14, 1981, with the county clerk and recorder shall file a notice of completion, as provided in
21 subsection (3) (4), with the department to perfect the water right. The filing of a claim pursuant to 85-2-221 is
22 sufficient notice of completion under this subsection. The priority date of the appropriation is the date of the
23 filing of a notice, as provided in subsection (3) (4), or the date of the filing of the claim of existing water right.
24 (5)(6) An appropriation under subsection (4) (5) is an existing right, and a permit is not required.
25 However, the department shall acknowledge the receipt of a correct and complete filing of a notice of
26 completion, except that for an appropriation of 35 gallons a minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet a year,
27 the department shall issue a certificate of water right. If a certificate is issued under this section, a certificate
28 need not be issued under the adjudication proceedings provided for in 85-2-236.

13 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
14 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
15 of other appropriators.
16 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
17 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
18 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
19 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
