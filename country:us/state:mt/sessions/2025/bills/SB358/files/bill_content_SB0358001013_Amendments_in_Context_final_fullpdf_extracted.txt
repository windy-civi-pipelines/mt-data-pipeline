18 "85-2-381. Water right enforcement of ground water uses exempt from permitting -- findings
19 and purpose. (1) The legislature finds that:
20 (a) the state of Montana has managed the allocation of water under the prior appropriation
21 doctrine for more than 100 years;
22 (b) Article IX, section 3, of the Montana constitution recognizes and confirms all existing water
23 rights;
24 (c) the right to the use of water through a water right is a recognized property right;
25 (d) the development of ground water wells that are exempt from permitting may have an adverse
26 effect on other water rights;
27 (e) the Water Use Act requires the department to coordinate the development and use of the water
28 resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources; and

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Toni Henneman, SB0358.001.013
1 (f) the ability to develop ground water wells that are exempt from permitting contributes to the full
2 utilization of the water resources of the state.
3 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
4 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
5 surface water rights.
6 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
7 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
8 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
9 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
10 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
11 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
12 enforcement according to priority by:
13 (a) any remedy legally available;
14 (b) the department, upon receiving a complaint, through the provisions of 85-2-114 and 85-2-122;
15 or
16 (c) a water commissioner appointed pursuant to 85-5-101.
17 (5) For each certificate issued pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) after October 1, 2013, the department
18 shall include written notice of the provisions of this section."

18 "85-2-381. Water right enforcement of ground water uses exempt from permitting -- findings
19 and purpose. (1) The legislature finds that:
20 (a) the state of Montana has managed the allocation of water under the prior appropriation
21 doctrine for more than 100 years;
22 (b) Article IX, section 3, of the Montana constitution recognizes and confirms all existing water
23 rights;
24 (c) the right to the use of water through a water right is a recognized property right;
25 (d) the development of ground water wells that are exempt from permitting may have an adverse
26 effect on other water rights;
27 (e) the Water Use Act requires the department to coordinate the development and use of the water
28 resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources; and

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Toni Henneman, SB0358.001.013
1 (f) the ability to develop ground water wells that are exempt from permitting contributes to the full
2 utilization of the water resources of the state.
3 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
4 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
5 surface water rights.
6 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
7 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
8 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
9 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
10 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
11 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
12 enforcement according to priority by:
13 (a) any remedy legally available;
14 (b) the department, upon receiving a complaint, through the provisions of 85-2-114 and 85-2-122;
15 or
16 (c) a water commissioner appointed pursuant to 85-5-101.
17 (5) For each certificate issued pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) after October 1, 2013, the department
18 shall include written notice of the provisions of this section."
