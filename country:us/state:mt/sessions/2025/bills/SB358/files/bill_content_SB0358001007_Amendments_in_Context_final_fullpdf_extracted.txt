- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Jason Mohr, SB0358.001.007
1 rights;
2 (c) the right to the use of water through a water right is a recognized property right;
3 (d) the development of ground water wells that are exempt from permitting may have an adverse
4 effect on other water rights;
5 (e) the Water Use Act requires the department to coordinate the development and use of the water
6 resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources; and
7 (f) the ability to develop ground water wells that are exempt from permitting contributes to the full
8 utilization of the water resources of the state.
9 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
10 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
11 surface water rights.
12 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
13 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
14 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
15 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
16 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
17 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
18 enforcement according to priority by:
19 (a) any remedy legally available;
20 (b) the department, upon receiving a complaint, through the provisions of 85-2-114 and 85-2-122;
21 or
22 (c) a water commissioner appointed pursuant to 85-5-101.

1 rights;
2 (c) the right to the use of water through a water right is a recognized property right;
3 (d) the development of ground water wells that are exempt from permitting may have an adverse
4 effect on other water rights;
5 (e) the Water Use Act requires the department to coordinate the development and use of the water
6 resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources; and
7 (f) the ability to develop ground water wells that are exempt from permitting contributes to the full
8 utilization of the water resources of the state.
9 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
10 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
11 surface water rights.
12 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
13 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
14 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
15 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
16 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
17 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
18 enforcement according to priority by:
19 (a) any remedy legally available;
20 (b) the department, upon receiving a complaint, through the provisions of 85-2-114 and 85-2-122;
