7 permit as prescribed by this part. Subject to subsection (7)(b) (8)(b), upon receipt of a correct and complete
8 application for a stock water provisional permit, the department shall automatically issue a provisional permit. If
9 the department determines after a hearing that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely
10 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
11 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
12 of other appropriators.
13 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
14 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
15 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
16 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
17 (c) The purpose of use authorized for a provisional permit pursuant to subsection (9) may not be

20 and purpose. (1) The legislature finds that:
21 (a) the state of Montana has managed the allocation of water under the prior appropriation
22 doctrine for more than 100 years;
23 (b) Article IX, section 3, of the Montana constitution recognizes and confirms all existing water
24 rights;
25 (c) the right to the use of water through a water right is a recognized property right;
26 (d) the development of ground water wells that are exempt from permitting may have an adverse

1 resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources; and
2 (f) the ability to develop ground water wells that are exempt from permitting contributes to the full
3 utilization of the water resources of the state.
4 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
5 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
6 surface water rights.
7 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
8 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
9 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
10 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
11 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
12 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
13 enforcement according to priority by:
14 (a) any remedy legally available;
15 (b) the department, upon receiving a complaint, through the provisions of 85-2-114 and 85-2-122;
16 or
17 (c) a water commissioner appointed pursuant to 85-5-101.

3 sufficient notice of the hearing to all interested persons.
4 (5)(6) (a) The department may designate a permanent public health, safety, and welfare controlled
5 ground water area by rule if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that any of the following criteria have
6 been met and cannot be appropriately mitigated:
7 (a)(i) current or projected reductions of recharge to the aquifer or aquifers in the proposed controlled
8 ground water area will cause ground water levels to decline to the extent that water right holders cannot
9 reasonably exercise their water rights;
10 (b)(ii) current or projected ground water withdrawals from the aquifer or aquifers in the proposed
11 controlled ground water area have reduced or will reduce ground water levels or surface water availability
12 necessary for water right holders to reasonably exercise their water rights;
