69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Toni Henneman, SB0358.001.011
1 and purpose. (1) The legislature finds that:
2 (a) the state of Montana has managed the allocation of water under the prior appropriation
3 doctrine for more than 100 years;
4 (b) Article IX, section 3, of the Montana constitution recognizes and confirms all existing water
5 rights;
6 (c) the right to the use of water through a water right is a recognized property right;
7 (d) the development of ground water wells that are exempt from permitting may have an adverse
8 effect on other water rights;
9 (e) the Water Use Act requires the department to coordinate the development and use of the water
10 resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources; and
11 (f) the ability to develop ground water wells that are exempt from permitting contributes to the full
12 utilization of the water resources of the state.
13 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
14 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
15 surface water rights.
16 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
17 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
18 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
19 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
20 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
21 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
22 enforcement according to priority by:
23 (a) any remedy legally available;
24 (b) the department, upon receiving a complaint, through the provisions of 85-2-114 and 85-2-122;
25 or
26 (c) a water commissioner appointed pursuant to 85-5-101.

15 with the Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies.
16 (ii) determines that 70% or more of the ground water in the aquifer has been appropriated;
17 (iii) determines that aquifer recharge is reliant on irrigation losses or where the geologic structure
18 or formation has limited storage or limited storage potential based on available data or in consultation with the
19 Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies; or
20 (iv) determines that 90% or more of the hydraulically connected surface water has been
21 appropriated during any month.
22 (b) (i)Control provisions for water quantity ground water monitoring areas must include but are not
23 limited to:
24 (A) requiring the department to develop a monitoring plan for each designated ground water
25 monitoring area in consultation with the Montana bureau of mines and geology or other relevant agencies;
