3 environmental quality and a predetermination letter from the department of natural resources and conservation
4 before February 14, 2024, then the water uses for the subdivision lots and volumes allocated in the
5 predetermination letter define the amount of water allowed without a permit under the exception in this

18 (ii) Upon receipt of the notice, the department shall review the notice and may, before issuing a
19 certificate of water right, return a defective notice for correction or completion, together with the reasons for
20 returning it. A notice does not lose priority of filing because of defects if the notice is corrected, completed, and
21 refiled with the department within 30 days of notification of defects or within a further time as the department
22 may allow, not to exceed 6 months.
23 (iii) If a notice is not corrected and completed within the time allowed, the priority date of
24 appropriation is the date of refiling a correct and complete notice with the department.
25 (c)(d) A certificate of water right may not be issued until a correct and complete notice has been filed
26 with the department, including proof of landowner notification or a written federal special use authorization as
27 necessary under subsection (1). The original of the certificate must be sent to the appropriator. The department
28 shall keep a copy of the certificate in its office in Helena. The date of filing of the notice of completion is the date

7 (3)(d)(i) (4)(e)(i) are met.
8 (iv) When the appropriation is for a water supply system that is subject to Title 75, chapter 6, part 1,
9 and is located outside of a stream depletion zone and does not exceed 10 acre-feet a year:
10 (A) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b)(i) (4)(c)(i), the appropriation will be considered perfected
11 upon completion of construction of the water supply system.
12 (B) A copy of the department of environmental quality approval for the water supply system must
13 be submitted with the notice of completion. This section does not preclude the public water supply developer or
14 any subsequent owners from expanding the water system or from revising the water use restrictions within the
15 subdivision, provided that the total amount does not exceed 10 acre-feet per year.
16 (C) Water appropriated under this exception must be measured and reported annually to the
17 department.
18 (4)(5) An appropriator of ground water by means of a well or developed spring first put to beneficial

20 force prior to April 14, 1981, with the county clerk and recorder shall file a notice of completion, as provided in
21 subsection (3) (4), with the department to perfect the water right. The filing of a claim pursuant to 85-2-221 is
22 sufficient notice of completion under this subsection. The priority date of the appropriation is the date of the
23 filing of a notice, as provided in subsection (3) (4), or the date of the filing of the claim of existing water right.
24 (5)(6) An appropriation under subsection (4) (5) is an existing right, and a permit is not required.
25 However, the department shall acknowledge the receipt of a correct and complete filing of a notice of
26 completion, except that for an appropriation of 35 gallons a minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet a year,
27 the department shall issue a certificate of water right. If a certificate is issued under this section, a certificate
28 need not be issued under the adjudication proceedings provided for in 85-2-236.

14 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights
15 of other appropriators.
16 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
17 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
18 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
19 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.

1 doctrine for more than 100 years;
2 (b) Article IX, section 3, of the Montana constitution recognizes and confirms all existing water
3 rights;
4 (c) the right to the use of water through a water right is a recognized property right;
5 (d) the development of ground water wells that are exempt from permitting may have an adverse
6 effect on other water rights;
7 (e) the Water Use Act requires the department to coordinate the development and use of the water
8 resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources; and
9 (f) the ability to develop ground water wells that are exempt from permitting contributes to the full
10 utilization of the water resources of the state.
11 (2) The establishment of a stream depletion zone pursuant to 85-2-380 provides a conclusive,
12 scientific basis for determining where ground water rights that are exempt from permitting are affecting senior
13 surface water rights.
14 (3) The purpose of this section is to continue allocating water under the exemptions provided for in
15 85-2-306 while providing a process by which senior water right holders may protect their rights under the prior
16 appropriation doctrine. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the ability of a senior water right holder to
17 enforce a water right or limit that enforcement to a specific area. Creation of a stream depletion zone is not a
18 prerequisite to an enforcement action.
19 (4) Any use of water granted by a certificate of water right pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) is subject to
20 enforcement according to priority by:
21 (a) any remedy legally available;
22 (b) the department, upon receiving a complaint, through the provisions of 85-2-114 and 85-2-122;
23 or
24 (c) a water commissioner appointed pursuant to 85-5-101.
25 (5) For each certificate issued pursuant to 85-2-306(3)(a) after October 1, 2013, the department
