9 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
10
11 Section 1. Section 46-18-203, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "46-18-203. Revocation of suspended or deferred sentence. (1) Upon the filing of a petition for
13 revocation showing probable cause that the offender has violated any condition of a sentence, any condition of
14 a deferred imposition of sentence, or any condition of supervision after release from imprisonment imposed
15 pursuant to 45-5-503(4), 45-5-507(5), 45-5-601(3), 45-5-625(4), or 45-5-711, the judge may issue an order for a
16 hearing on revocation. The order must require the offender to appear at a specified time and place for the
17 hearing and be served by delivering a copy of the petition and order to the offender personally. The judge may
18 also issue an arrest warrant directing any peace officer or a probation and parole officer to arrest the offender
19 and bring the offender before the court.
20 (2) The petition for a revocation must be filed with the sentencing court either before the period of
21 suspension or deferral has begun or during the period of suspension or deferral but not after the period has
22 expired. Expiration of the period of suspension or deferral after the petition is filed does not deprive the court of
23 its jurisdiction to rule on the petition.
24 (3) The provisions pertaining to bail, as set forth in Title 46, chapter 9, are applicable to persons
25 arrested pursuant to this section.
26 (4) Without unnecessary delay and no more than 60 days after arrest, the offender must be
27 brought before the judge, and at least 10 days prior to the hearing the offender must be advised of:
28 (a) the allegations of the petition;
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – SB 70
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 70.1
1 (b) the opportunity to appear and to present evidence in the offender's own behalf;
2 (c) the opportunity to question adverse witnesses; and
3 (d) the right to be represented by counsel at the revocation hearing pursuant to Title 46, chapter 8,
4 part 1.
5 (5) A hearing is required before a suspended or deferred sentence can be revoked or the terms or
6 conditions of the sentence can be modified unless:
7 (a) the offender admits the allegations and waives the right to a hearing; or
8 (b) the sentencing court, the probationer, or the county attorney in the sentencing jurisdiction has
9 not objected to the removal of a condition of supervision pursuant to 46-23-1011; or
10 (b)(c) the relief to be granted is favorable to the offender and the prosecutor, after having been given
11 notice of the proposed relief and a reasonable opportunity to object, has not objected. An extension of the term
12 of probation is not favorable to the offender for the purposes of this subsection (5)(b) (5)(c).
13 (6) (a) At the hearing, the prosecution shall prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there
14 has been a violation of:
15 (i) the terms and conditions of the suspended or deferred sentence; or
16 (ii) a condition of supervision after release from imprisonment imposed pursuant to 45-5-503(4),
17 45-5-507(5), 45-5-601(3), 45-5-625(4), or 45-5-711.
18 (b) However, when a failure to pay restitution is the basis for the petition, the offender may excuse
19 the violation by showing sufficient evidence that the failure to pay restitution was not attributable to a failure on
20 the offender's part to make a good faith effort to obtain sufficient means to make the restitution payments as
21 ordered.
22 (7) (a) If the judge finds that the offender has violated the terms and conditions of the suspended
23 or deferred sentence by committing either a compliance violations violation or a noncompliance violations
24 violation, or both, the judge may:
25 (i) continue the suspended or deferred sentence without a change in conditions;
26 (ii) continue the suspended sentence with modified or additional terms and conditions, which may
27 include placement in:
28 (A) a secure facility designated by the department for up to 9 months; or
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – SB 70

69th Legislature 2025 SB 70.1

2 including but not limited to placement in a prerelease center, sanction or hold bed, transitional living program,
3 enhanced supervision program, relapse intervention bed, chemical dependency treatment, or 24/7 sobriety
4 program;
5 (iii) revoke the suspension of sentence and require the offender to serve either the sentence
6 imposed or any sentence that could have been imposed that does not include a longer imprisonment or
7 commitment term than the original sentence; or
8 (iv) if the sentence was deferred, impose any sentence that might have been originally imposed.
9 (b) If a suspended or deferred sentence is revoked, the judge shall consider any elapsed time,
10 consult the records and recollection of the probation and parole officer, and allow all of the elapsed time served
11 without any record or recollection of violations as a credit against the sentence. If the judge determines that
12 elapsed time should not be credited, the judge shall state the reasons for the determination in the order. Credit
13 must be allowed for time served in a detention center or for home arrest time already served.
14 (c) If the judge finds that the offender has not violated a term or condition of a suspended or
15 deferred sentence, the judge is not prevented from setting, modifying, or adding conditions of probation as
16 provided in 46-23-1011.
17 (8) If the judge finds that the prosecution has not proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
18 there has been a violation of the terms and conditions of the suspended or deferred sentence, the petition must
19 be dismissed and the offender, if in custody, must be immediately released.
20 (9) All sanction and placement decisions must be documented in the offender's file.
21 (10) As used in this section:
22 (a) "absconding" means when an offender deliberately makes the offender's whereabouts
23 unknown to a probation and parole officer or fails to report for the purposes of avoiding supervision, and
24 reasonable efforts by the probation and parole officer to locate the offender have been unsuccessful; and
25 (b) "compliance violation" means a violation of the conditions of supervision that is not:
26 (i) a new criminal offense;
27 (ii) possession of a firearm in violation of a condition of probation;
28 (iii) behavior by the offender or any person acting at the offender's direction that could be

1 considered stalking, harassing, or threatening the victim of the offense or a member of the victim's immediate

14 with the conditions set by a sentencing judge. If the sentencing judge did not set conditions of probation at the
15 time of sentencing, the court shall, at the request of the department, hold a hearing and set conditions of

22 department shall request a hearing with a sentencing judge and recommend that the judge add the condition of
23 probation. If the victim is a minor, a parent or guardian of the victim may make the request on the victim's
24 behalf.
25 (3) A copy of the conditions of probation must be signed by the probationer. The department may

18 also issue an arrest warrant directing any peace officer or a probation and parole officer to arrest the offender
19 and bring the offender before the court.
20 (2) The petition for a revocation must be filed with the sentencing court either before the period of
21 suspension or deferral has begun or during the period of suspension or deferral but not after the period has
22 expired. Expiration of the period of suspension or deferral after the petition is filed does not deprive the court of

24 (3) The provisions pertaining to bail, as set forth in Title 46, chapter 9, are applicable to persons
25 arrested pursuant to this section.
26 (4) Without unnecessary delay and no more than 60 days after arrest, the offender must be

24 behalf.
25 (3) A copy of the conditions of probation must be signed by the probationer. The department may
