12 "82-4-340. Successor operator. (1) When Subject to this part, when one operator succeeds to the
13 interest of another in any uncompleted operation by transfer, including sale, assignment, lease, or otherwise,
14 the department may release the first operator from the duties imposed upon on the operator by this part,.
15 provided Provided that both operators comply with the requirements of this part and the successor operator
16 assumes the duty of the former operator to complete the reclamation of the land and the ability to operate
17 pursuant to the permit or subsequent modifications approved by the department to the permit consistent with
18 this part, in which case the department shall transfer the permit to the successor operator upon on department
19 approval of the successor operator's bond and the transfer of property interests, as required under this part.
20 (2) A transfer by the department to a successor operator pursuant to this section may not affect a
21 lien, claim, encumbrance, or interest in the property subject to operations that the department determines are
22 valid at the time of the transfer and rights and defenses associated with the lien, claim, encumbrance, or
23 interest. This subsection does not apply to a lien, claim, encumbrance, or interest in a property of the original
24 operator or an affiliate or person controlling the operator or affiliate.
25 (2) (3) For an operation with a forfeited bond where the department holds a suspended permit

10 and egress to the permit boundary, if:
11 (a) the department makes written findings that it is in the public interest of Montana taxpayers,
12 environmental protection, and reclamation. With the written findings, the right of eminent domain must be
13 considered a public use as included with those listed in 70-30-102. Although not required, the department may
14 consider the following when determining the public interest:
15 (i) the value of the property, fixtures, and potential for operations if the property is transferred,

17 eminent domain proceedings pursuant to Title 70, chapter 30;
18 (ii) the existence of tax liens on the property;
19 (iii) the financial liability to the Montana taxpayers for the cost of reclamation or remediation by the

4 subsection (1). The department and the proposed successor operator may enter into an agreement for the
5 transfer of the property when it is condemned and the department takes possession pursuant to subsection (5).
6 (5) If the department initiates eminent domain proceedings pursuant to Title 70, chapter 30, and

1 adopted under this part, or the permit.
2 (2) The permittee shall proceed with reclamation as scheduled in the approved reclamation plan or
3 as required pursuant to subsection (9). Following written notice by the department noting deficiencies, the
4 permittee shall commence action within 30 days to rectify these deficiencies and shall diligently proceed until
5 the deficiencies are corrected. Deficiencies that also violate other laws that require earlier rectification must be
6 corrected in accordance with the applicable time provisions of those laws. The department may extend
7 performance periods referred to in 82-4-336 and in this section for delays clearly beyond the permittee's control,
8 but only when the permittee is, in the opinion of the department, making every reasonable effort to comply.
9 (3) Within 30 days after notification by the permittee and when, in the judgment of the department,
10 reclamation of a unit of disturbed land area is properly completed, the department shall provide the public
11 notice and conduct any hearing requested pursuant to 82-4-338. As soon as practicable after notice and
12 hearing, the permittee must be notified in writing and the bond on the area must be released or decreased
13 proportionately to the acreage included within the bond coverage.
14 (4) The department shall cause the bond to be forfeited if:
15 (a) reclamation of disturbed land is not pursued in accordance with the reclamation plan and the
16 permittee has not commenced action to rectify deficiencies within 30 days after notification by the department;
17 (b) reclamation is not properly completed in conformance with the reclamation plan within 2 years
18 after completion or abandonment of operation on any fraction of the permit area or within a longer period that

25 (6) The department may, with the staff, equipment, and material under its control or by contract
26 with others, take any necessary actions for required reclamation of the disturbed lands according to the existing
27 reclamation plan or a modified reclamation plan if the department makes a written finding that the modifications
28 are necessary to prevent a violation of Title 75, chapter 2 or 5, or to prevent a substantial reclamation failure.

1 Except in an environmental emergency, work provided for in this section must be let on the basis of competitive
2 bidding. The department shall keep a record of all necessary expenses incurred in carrying out the work or
3 activity authorized under this section, including a reasonable charge for the services performed by the state's
4 personnel and the state's equipment and materials used. The surety is liable to the state to the extent of the
5 bond. The permittee is liable for the remainder of the cost. Upon completion of the reclamation, the department
6 shall return to the surety any amount not expended, including any unexpended interest accrued on bond
7 proceeds, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the surety.
8 (7) In addition to the other liabilities imposed by this part, failure to commence an action to remedy
9 specific deficiencies in reclamation within 30 days after notification by the department or failure to satisfactorily
10 complete reclamation work on any segment of the permit area within 2 years or within a longer period that the
11 department may permit on the permittee's application or on the department's own motion, after completion or
12 abandonment of operations on any segment of the permit area, constitutes sufficient grounds for cancellation of
13 a permit or license and refusal to issue another permit or license to the applicant. A cancellation action may not
14 be effected while an appeal is pending from any ruling requiring the cancellation of a permit or license.
15 (8) (a) Except as provided in subsection (8)(e), the department may hold a permit suspended
16 pursuant to 82-4-338 for up to 5 years and place the proceeds from a cash bond forfeited under this section in
17 an interest-bearing account if mining of the ore body identified in the permit or a permit amendment application
18 is not complete. The 5-year period begins on the date the department takes possession of the bond proceeds.
19 (b) The department may spend bond proceeds from the account during the suspension period to:
20 (i) perform maintenance, monitoring, and other actions required by the permit;
21 (ii) abate imminent danger to public health, public safety, or the environment; or
22 (iii) abate conditions that violate the provisions of Title 75, chapters 2 and 5, or conditions that may
23 cause violations of those provisions.

25 and the associated property interest pursuant to 70-30-311 to grant the condemnor immediate possession and
26 provide compensation to the property owner pursuant to 70-30-302. The balance of funds in the account must
27 be retained as a cash bond on behalf of the successor operator.
28 (d) A transfer by the department to a successor operator pursuant to subsection (2) may not affect
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 717
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 717.1
1 a lien, claim, encumbrance, or interest in the property subject to operations, which the department determines
2 is valid at the time of the transfer and rights and defenses associated with the lien, claim, encumbrance, or
3 interest. This subsection (8)(d) does not apply to a lien, claim, encumbrance, or interest in a property of the
4 original operator or an affiliate or person controlling the operator or affiliate.
5 (d) (e) The department may revoke a permit suspended under this section if a transfer is not
6 completed within 5 years of the suspension. In the case of a revoked permit, reclamation may proceed pursuant
7 to subsection (6).
8 (e) (f) The department may extend a suspension up to 6 months if a potential successor operator is
9 exercising reasonable diligence to complete the transfer. If litigation precludes the transfer, the suspension is
10 stayed until the litigation is resolved.
11 (g) If the department forfeits a bond pursuant to subsection (8)(a), the operator is liable to the
12 department for the insufficient bond amount, which is the difference between the bond amount forfeited
13 pursuant to 82-4-341 and the bond amount calculated pursuant to 82-4-338. This amount is not subject to a
14 bona fide dispute. The department may initiate cases and proceedings to recover the insufficient bond amount.
15 (9) (a) If at the time of bond review pursuant to 82-4-338 no mineral extraction or ore processing
16 has occurred on a mine permit area for the past 5 years, the department shall determine whether further
17 suspension of the operation will create conditions that will cause violations of Title 75, chapter 2 or 5, or
18 significantly impair reclamation of disturbed areas. If the department determines in writing that violations of Title
19 75, chapter 2 or 5, or significant impairment of reclamation will occur, the department shall notify the permittee
20 that the permittee shall, within a reasonable time specified in the notice, abate the conditions or commence
21 reclamation. The department may grant reasonable extensions of time for good cause shown. If the permittee
22 does not abate the conditions or commence reclamation within the time specified in the notice and any
23 extensions, the department shall order either that the condition be abated or that reclamation be commenced.
24 (b) The permittee may request a hearing on the order by submitting a written request for hearing
25 within 30 days of receipt of the order. A request for hearing stays the order pending a final decision, unless the
26 department determines in writing that the stay will create an imminent threat of significant environmental harm
27 or will significantly impair reclamation."

9 exercising reasonable diligence to complete the transfer. If litigation precludes the transfer, the suspension is
10 stayed until the litigation is resolved.
11 (g) If the department forfeits a bond pursuant to subsection (8)(a), the operator is liable to the
12 department for the insufficient bond amount, which is the difference between the bond amount forfeited
13 pursuant to 82-4-341 and the bond amount calculated pursuant to 82-4-338. This amount is not subject to a
14 bona fide dispute. The department may initiate cases and proceedings to recover the insufficient bond amount.
15 (9) (a) If at the time of bond review pursuant to 82-4-338 no mineral extraction or ore processing
16 has occurred on a mine permit area for the past 5 years, the department shall determine whether further
17 suspension of the operation will create conditions that will cause violations of Title 75, chapter 2 or 5, or
18 significantly impair reclamation of disturbed areas. If the department determines in writing that violations of Title
19 75, chapter 2 or 5, or significant impairment of reclamation will occur, the department shall notify the permittee
20 that the permittee shall, within a reasonable time specified in the notice, abate the conditions or commence
21 reclamation. The department may grant reasonable extensions of time for good cause shown. If the permittee
22 does not abate the conditions or commence reclamation within the time specified in the notice and any
23 extensions, the department shall order either that the condition be abated or that reclamation be commenced.
24 (b) The permittee may request a hearing on the order by submitting a written request for hearing
25 within 30 days of receipt of the order. A request for hearing stays the order pending a final decision, unless the
26 department determines in writing that the stay will create an imminent threat of significant environmental harm
27 or will significantly impair reclamation."
