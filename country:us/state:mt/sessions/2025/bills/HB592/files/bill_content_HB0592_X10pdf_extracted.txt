for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
comments received by the means set forth in the notice, and the reasons for overruling the considerations
urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as proposed and as
adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that rule is published in

(2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
language.
(3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
(a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
(b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
(4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
(5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
(6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
(a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
(b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
reasonable necessity for the rule.
(7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
reference to the latest notice in all cases.
(8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
(b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
(c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
proposal for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
(9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
committee's records.
(10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704.
(11)(10)(a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an agency
may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
(b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
(i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
(ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
(iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.
(c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
(ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."

notice proposing the rule was published by the secretary of state, unless, following the committee's formal
objection under 2-4-406(1)(2) and subject to 2-4-112:
(i) the committee withdraws its objection under 2-4-406 before the proposed rule is adopted; or
(ii) the rule or portion of a rule objected to is adopted with changes that in the opinion of a majority
of the committee members, as communicated in writing to the committee presiding officer and staff, make it
comply with the committee's objection and concerns.
(5) An agency may not enforce, implement, or otherwise treat as effective a rule proposed or
adopted by the agency until the effective date of the rule as provided in this section. Nothing in this subsection
prohibits an agency from enforcing an established policy or practice of the agency that existed prior to the
proposal or adoption of the rule as long as the policy or practice is within the scope of the agency's lawful
authority.
(6) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704."

(a) the committee shall notify the agency in writing of the objection;
(b) the committee shall address the objections at the next committee meeting; and
(c) the objecting members shall be identified in the committee’s records.
(d) The proposal notice to which the committee objects may not be adopted until publication of the

ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and does not renew the objection by
majority vote.
(2) (a) Subject to 2-4-112, the appropriate administrative rule review committee may formally
object to a proposed or adopted rule. if If the appropriate administrative rule review committee objects to all or
some portion of a proposed or adopted rule because the committee, by majority vote, considers it not to have
been proposed or adopted in substantial compliance with 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305, the committee shall
send a written objection to the agency that promulgated the rule. :
(i) The objection must contain that contains a concise statement of the committee's reasons for its
action. ;
(ii) that sets forth the provisions of 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305 with which the proposal does not
comply and the basis for belief of noncompliance; and
(iii) that must be included in the committee's records.
(b) Following notice by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the
committee objects to may not be adopted until:
(i) publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
does not make the same objection; or
(ii) as provided in 2-4-306(4)(c).
(2)(3) Within 14 days after the mailing of a committee formal objection to a rule, the agency
promulgating the rule shall respond in writing to the committee. After receipt of the response, the committee
may withdraw or modify its objection.
(3)(4) Subject to 2-4-112, if the committee fails to withdraw or substantially modify its formal objection
to a rule, it may vote to send the objection to the secretary of state, who shall, upon receipt of the objection,
publish the objection in the register adjacent to any notice of adoption of the rule and in the ARM adjacent to
the rule, provided an agency response must also be published if requested by the agency. Costs of publication
of the objection and the agency response must be paid by the committee.
(4)(5) If an a formal objection to all or a portion of a rule has been published pursuant to subsection
(3) (4), the agency bears the burden, in any action challenging the legality of the rule or portion of a rule
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
objected to by the committee, of proving that the rule or portion of the rule objected to was adopted in
substantial compliance with 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305. If a rule is invalidated by court judgment because
the agency failed to meet its burden of proof imposed by this subsection and the court finds that the rule was
adopted in arbitrary and capricious disregard for the purposes of the authorizing statute, the court may award
costs and reasonable attorney fees against the agency."

Section 13:
Section 9. Section 37-1-122, MCA, is amended to read:
"37-1-122. Active supervision -- rebuttable presumption -- reconsideration. (1) (a) Before making
a determination approving or disapproving a board action subject to active supervision as provided in 37-1-
121(1)(d), the commissioner of labor and industry shall:
(i) notify the affected board and the economic affairs interim committee in writing of the particular
action identified for commissioner review;
(ii) give the board a timeframe of at least 30 days in which to provide the commissioner with
written comments and materials justifying the proposed action; and
(iii) meet with the board or its representatives regarding the board action.
(b) The commissioner may require that the board provide the commissioner with other relevant
information, including but not limited to comments, documents, or other material submitted to the board
regarding the board action.
(c) The commissioner may approve a board action subject to active supervision under 37-1-
121(1)(d) without the notice and opportunity for board comment required under subsection (1)(a) if the
commissioner has sufficient information to act.
(2) (a) There is a rebuttable presumption that if a board has not received a written notice as
provided in 37-1-121(1)(d) regarding a board action within 30 days, that the board action is presumed to be
approved by the commissioner because the department has determined the board action will not unreasonably
restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition in trade or commerce.
(b) At any time a board may request that the department or commissioner confirm in writing that a
board action is not subject to active supervision under 37-1-121(1)(d) because the commissioner has
determined that the board action will not unreasonably restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
in trade or commerce.
(3) If the commissioner determines that a board action is subject to active supervision procedures
under 37-1-121(1)(d) and this section, the commissioner shall issue a written determination within 30 days after
meeting with the board or its representatives as provided in subsection (1).
(4) (a) The board may request that the commissioner reconsider the determination. A request
under this subsection (4) must be in writing, provide any additional supporting materials or arguments, and be
received by the commissioner within 10 days after issuance of the commissioner's written determination.

reconsideration process.
(c) The commissioner shall issue a written reconsideration decision within 10 days of receiving the
written request for a reconsideration or within 10 days after meeting with the board or its representatives
regarding the redetermination.
(5) This section may not be construed to mean that the commissioner's determination under 37-1-
121(1)(d) or the process described in this section is a contested case proceeding as defined in 2-4-102.
(6) (a) After the economic affairs interim committee is notified of the commissioner's decision to
issue a written determination or redetermination, the committee shall notify the commissioner if the committee
plans to provide an opportunity for public comment on the commissioner's action at the next committee
meeting.
(b) The commissioner shall notify the economic affairs interim committee of a final determination
under this section. The committee shall follow the procedures in Title 2, chapter 4, if the committee decides to
conduct a review. A final determination of the commissioner may be suspended as provided in 2-4-305(9) by
the committee whether the determination is for a rule or for another board action."

Section 14:
Section 10. Codification instruction. [Section 1] is intended to be codified as an integral part of Title
2, chapter 4, part 3, and the provisions of Title 2, chapter 4, part 3, apply to [section 1].

Section 15:
Section 11. Coordination instruction. If both House Bill No. 126 and [this act] are passed and
approved and if both contain a section that amends 2-4-302, then House Bill No. 126 is void and [section 1 of
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
this act] must be amended as follows:
"Section 1. Sponsor contact for administrative rulemaking -- sponsor comments -- request for
economic impact statement. (1) When an agency begins to work on the substantive content of a proposal
notice for a rule that initially implements legislation, and not less than 10 days in advance of a proposal notice,
the agency shall contact the legislator who was the primary sponsor of the legislation. The primary sponsor
must be contacted at the sponsor's legislative e-mail address. An agency has complied with the primary
sponsor contact requirements of this section upon sending the e-mail meeting the requirements of this
subsection. If an agency fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection, then the proposal notice is
ineffective. The agency shall:
(a) inform the sponsor of known and expected dates in the rulemaking process;
(b) provide the sponsor a timeline to submit informal comments or to meet to discuss the
rulemaking; and
(c) invite the sponsor's explanation of the legislation's intent.
(2) If comments received from the sponsor are not incorporated into the rules proposed, the
agency shall set forth the reasons for not incorporating the comments as part of the proposal notice. If the
primary sponsor submits comments pursuant to subsection (1)(b) for an agency proposal and the agency
disagrees with the primary sponsor, the agency shall publish the primary sponsor’s unredacted comments in
the proposal notice and provide a statement explaining why the sponsor’s comments were not incorporated into
the proposed rule.
(3) The sponsor may request an economic impact statement be prepared pursuant to 2-4-405. The
request must set forth the requirements of 2-4-405(2)(a) and an explanation of whether and how the economic
burden of the proposed rulemaking can be mitigated while implementing the sponsor's legislation. The request
must be directed to the appropriate administrative rule review committee, and the provisions of 2-4-405 apply.
(4) The sponsor is an interested person as set forth in 2-4-302 for purposes of rulemaking that
initially implements legislation."

Section 16:
Section 12. Coordination instruction. If both House Bill No. 126 and [this act] are passed and
approved and if both contain a section that amends 2-4-305, then House Bill No. 126 and [section 6 of this act],
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
amending 2-4-305, are void and 2-4-305 must be amended as follows:
"2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
that initially implements legislation.
(b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
comments received by the means set forth in the proposal notice and shall state the reasons for overruling the
considerations urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as
proposed and as adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that
rule is published in the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against
agency action. When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of
reasons.
(ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
by the primary sponsor by the means set forth in the proposal notice, the agency shall publish the sponsor's
unredacted comments in the adoption notice and provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments
were not incorporated into the adopted rule.
(2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
language.
(3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
(a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
(b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
(4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
(5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
(6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
(a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
(b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
reasonable necessity for the rule.
(7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
reference to the latest notice in all cases.
(8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
(b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
(c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
proposal for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
(9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
committee's records.
(10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704.
(11)(10)(a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an agency
may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
(b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
(i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
(ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
(iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.
(c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
(ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."

Section 17:
Section 13. Effective date. [This act] is effective on passage and approval.

Section 18:
Section 14. Applicability. [This act] applies to rule proposals published on or after [the effective date

(c) whether the citation of the code section or sections implemented is correct;
(d) whether the intended action is contrary to the code section or sections implemented or to other

(2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
language.
(3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
(a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
(b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
(4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
(5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
(6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
(a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
(b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
reasonable necessity for the rule.
(7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
reference to the latest notice in all cases.
(8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
(b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
(c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
proposal for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
(9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be

period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
committee's records.
(10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704.
(11)(10)(a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an agency
may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
(b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
(i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
(ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
(iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.
(c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
(ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."

(2) (a) There is a rebuttable presumption that if a board has not received a written notice as
provided in 37-1-121(1)(d) regarding a board action within 30 days, that the board action is presumed to be
approved by the commissioner because the department has determined the board action will not unreasonably
restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition in trade or commerce.
(b) At any time a board may request that the department or commissioner confirm in writing that a
board action is not subject to active supervision under 37-1-121(1)(d) because the commissioner has
determined that the board action will not unreasonably restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition

in trade or commerce.
(3) If the commissioner determines that a board action is subject to active supervision procedures
under 37-1-121(1)(d) and this section, the commissioner shall issue a written determination within 30 days after
meeting with the board or its representatives as provided in subsection (1).
(4) (a) The board may request that the commissioner reconsider the determination. A request
under this subsection (4) must be in writing, provide any additional supporting materials or arguments, and be
received by the commissioner within 10 days after issuance of the commissioner's written determination.
(b) The commissioner may meet with the board or representatives of the board as part of the
reconsideration process.
(c) The commissioner shall issue a written reconsideration decision within 10 days of receiving the
written request for a reconsideration or within 10 days after meeting with the board or its representatives
regarding the redetermination.
(5) This section may not be construed to mean that the commissioner's determination under 37-1-
121(1)(d) or the process described in this section is a contested case proceeding as defined in 2-4-102.
(6) (a) After the economic affairs interim committee is notified of the commissioner's decision to
issue a written determination or redetermination, the committee shall notify the commissioner if the committee
plans to provide an opportunity for public comment on the commissioner's action at the next committee
meeting.
(b) The commissioner shall notify the economic affairs interim committee of a final determination
under this section. The committee shall follow the procedures in Title 2, chapter 4, if the committee decides to
conduct a review. A final determination of the commissioner may be suspended as provided in 2-4-305(9) by
the committee whether the determination is for a rule or for another board action."
Section 10. Codification instruction. [Section 1] is intended to be codified as an integral part of Title
2, chapter 4, part 3, and the provisions of Title 2, chapter 4, part 3, apply to [section 1].
Section 11. Coordination instruction. If both House Bill No. 126 and [this act] are passed and
approved and if both contain a section that amends 2-4-302, then House Bill No. 126 is void and [section 1 of
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
this act] must be amended as follows:
"Section 1. Sponsor contact for administrative rulemaking -- sponsor comments -- request for
economic impact statement. (1) When an agency begins to work on the substantive content of a proposal
notice for a rule that initially implements legislation, and not less than 10 days in advance of a proposal notice,
the agency shall contact the legislator who was the primary sponsor of the legislation. The primary sponsor
must be contacted at the sponsor's legislative e-mail address. An agency has complied with the primary
sponsor contact requirements of this section upon sending the e-mail meeting the requirements of this
subsection. If an agency fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection, then the proposal notice is
ineffective. The agency shall:
(a) inform the sponsor of known and expected dates in the rulemaking process;
(b) provide the sponsor a timeline to submit informal comments or to meet to discuss the
rulemaking; and
(c) invite the sponsor's explanation of the legislation's intent.
(2) If comments received from the sponsor are not incorporated into the rules proposed, the
agency shall set forth the reasons for not incorporating the comments as part of the proposal notice. If the
primary sponsor submits comments pursuant to subsection (1)(b) for an agency proposal and the agency
disagrees with the primary sponsor, the agency shall publish the primary sponsor’s unredacted comments in
the proposal notice and provide a statement explaining why the sponsor’s comments were not incorporated into
the proposed rule.
(3) The sponsor may request an economic impact statement be prepared pursuant to 2-4-405. The
request must set forth the requirements of 2-4-405(2)(a) and an explanation of whether and how the economic
burden of the proposed rulemaking can be mitigated while implementing the sponsor's legislation. The request
must be directed to the appropriate administrative rule review committee, and the provisions of 2-4-405 apply.
(4) The sponsor is an interested person as set forth in 2-4-302 for purposes of rulemaking that
initially implements legislation."
Section 12. Coordination instruction. If both House Bill No. 126 and [this act] are passed and
approved and if both contain a section that amends 2-4-305, then House Bill No. 126 and [section 6 of this act],
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
amending 2-4-305, are void and 2-4-305 must be amended as follows:
"2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
that initially implements legislation.
(b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
comments received by the means set forth in the proposal notice and shall state the reasons for overruling the
considerations urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as
proposed and as adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that
rule is published in the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against
agency action. When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of
reasons.
(ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
by the primary sponsor by the means set forth in the proposal notice, the agency shall publish the sponsor's
unredacted comments in the adoption notice and provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments
were not incorporated into the adopted rule.
(2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
language.
(3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
(a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
(b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
(4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
(5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
(6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
(a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
(b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
reasonable necessity for the rule.
(7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
reference to the latest notice in all cases.
(8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
(b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
(c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
proposal for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
(9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
committee's records.
(10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704.
(11)(10)(a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an agency
may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
(b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
(i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 592
(ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
(iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.
(c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
(ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."
Section 13. Effective date. [This act] is effective on passage and approval.
Section 14. Applicability. [This act] applies to rule proposals published on or after [the effective date
of this act].
