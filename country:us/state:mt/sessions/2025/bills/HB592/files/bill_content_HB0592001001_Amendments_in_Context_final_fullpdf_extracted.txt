20 was mailed by the agency. If the proposal notice fails to state the date on which and the manner in which the
21 primary sponsor was contacted, the filing of the proposal notice under subsection (2)(a) is ineffective for the
22 purposes of this part and for the purposes of the law that the agency cites in the proposal notice as the

10 directly affected by the proposed rule, by a governmental subdivision or agency, by the appropriate
11 administrative rule review committee, or by an association having not less than 25 members who will be directly
12 affected. If the proposed rulemaking involves matters of significant interest to the public, the agency shall
13 schedule an oral hearing.

1 legislator who wishes to receive notice shall keep the current or former legislator's name, address, e-mail
2 address, and telephone number on file with the secretary of state. The secretary of state may also use
3 legislator contact information provided by the legislative services division for the purposes of the register. The
4 secretary of state shall update the contact information whenever the secretary of state receives corrected
5 information from the legislator or the legislative services division. An agency proposing rules shall consult the
6 register when providing sponsor contact.

12 (9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
13 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
14 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704."

16 Section 6. Section 2-4-305, MCA, is amended to read:
17 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
18 fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
19 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
20 that initially implements legislation.
21 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
22 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
23 comments received by the means set forth in the notice, and the reasons for overruling the considerations
24 urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as proposed and as
25 adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that rule is published in
26 the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against agency action.
27 When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of reasons.
28 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Ed Buttrey - (H) Business and Labor
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Jameson Walker, HB0592.001.001
1 by the primary sponsor, the agency shall provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments were not
2 incorporated into the adopted rule.
3 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
4 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
5 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
6 language.
7 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
8 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
9 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
10 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
11 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
12 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
13 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
14 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
15 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
16 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
17 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
18 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
19 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
20 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
21 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
22 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
23 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
24 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
25 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
26 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
27 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
28 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Ed Buttrey - (H) Business and Labor
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Jameson Walker, HB0592.001.001
1 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
2 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
3 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
4 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
5 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
6 reasonable necessity for the rule.
7 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
8 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
9 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
10 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
11 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
12 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
13 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
14 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
15 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
16 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
17 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
18 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
19 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
20 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
21 proposal for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
22 implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
23 same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
24 primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
25 comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
26 (9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
27 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
28 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a

11 views on the proposed action. The reasonable necessity must be written in plain, easily understood language. If
12 an oral hearing is not scheduled, the notice of proposed rulemaking must state that opportunity for oral hearing
13 must be granted if requested by either 10% or 25, whichever is less, of the persons who will be directly affected
14 by the proposed rule, by a governmental subdivision or agency, by the appropriate administrative rule review

20 was mailed by the agency. If the proposal notice fails to state the date on which and the manner in which the
21 primary sponsor was contacted, the filing of the proposal notice under subsection (2)(a) is ineffective for the
22 purposes of this part and for the purposes of the law that the agency cites in the proposal notice as the
23 authority for the proposed action.

22 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
23 comments received by the means set forth in the notice, and the reasons for overruling the considerations
24 urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as proposed and as
25 adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that rule is published in
26 the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against agency action.
27 When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of reasons.
28 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Jameson Walker, HB0592.001.001
1 by the primary sponsor, the agency shall provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments were not
2 incorporated into the adopted rule.
3 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
4 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
5 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
6 language.
7 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
8 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
9 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
10 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
11 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
12 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
13 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
14 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
15 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
16 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
17 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
18 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
19 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
20 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
21 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
22 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
23 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
24 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
25 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
26 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
27 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
28 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Ed Buttrey - (H) Business and Labor

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Jameson Walker, HB0592.001.001
1 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
2 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
3 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
4 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
5 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
6 reasonable necessity for the rule.
7 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
8 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
9 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
10 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
11 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
12 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
13 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
14 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
15 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
16 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
17 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
18 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
19 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
20 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
21 proposal for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
22 implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
23 same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
24 primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
25 comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
26 (9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
27 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
28 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a

2 by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
3 adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
4 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
5 does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
6 committee's records.
7 (10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
8 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
9 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704.
10 (11)(10)(a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an agency
11 may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
12 (b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
13 (i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
14 (ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
15 policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
16 (iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
17 statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.
18 (c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
19 under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
20 precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
21 (ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
22 copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
23 the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
24 object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
25 been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
26 review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
27 the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
28 objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."

7 requests corrections to the adoption notice, the rule is adopted on the date that the revised notice is filed with
8 the secretary of state.
9 (2) Pursuant to 2-15-401, the secretary of state may prescribe rules to effectively administer this

1 (4)(5) If an a formal objection to all or a portion of a rule has been published pursuant to subsection
2 (3) (4), the agency bears the burden, in any action challenging the legality of the rule or portion of a rule
3 objected to by the committee, of proving that the rule or portion of the rule objected to was adopted in
4 substantial compliance with 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305. If a rule is invalidated by court judgment because
5 the agency failed to meet its burden of proof imposed by this subsection and the court finds that the rule was
6 adopted in arbitrary and capricious disregard for the purposes of the authorizing statute, the court may award
7 costs and reasonable attorney fees against the agency."

19 information, including but not limited to comments, documents, or other material submitted to the board
20 regarding the board action.
21 (c) The commissioner may approve a board action subject to active supervision under 37-1-
22 121(1)(d) without the notice and opportunity for board comment required under subsection (1)(a) if the

25 provided in 37-1-121(1)(d) regarding a board action within 30 days, that the board action is presumed to be
26 approved by the commissioner because the department has determined the board action will not unreasonably
27 restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition in trade or commerce.
28 (b) At any time a board may request that the department or commissioner confirm in writing that a

1 board action is not subject to active supervision under 37-1-121(1)(d) because the commissioner has
2 determined that the board action will not unreasonably restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition
3 in trade or commerce.
4 (3) If the commissioner determines that a board action is subject to active supervision procedures
5 under 37-1-121(1)(d) and this section, the commissioner shall issue a written determination within 30 days after

11 reconsideration process.
12 (c) The commissioner shall issue a written reconsideration decision within 10 days of receiving the
13 written request for a reconsideration or within 10 days after meeting with the board or its representatives
14 regarding the redetermination.
15 (5) This section may not be construed to mean that the commissioner's determination under 37-1-
16 121(1)(d) or the process described in this section is a contested case proceeding as defined in 2-4-102.
17 (6) (a) After the economic affairs interim committee is notified of the commissioner's decision to
18 issue a written determination or redetermination, the committee shall notify the commissioner if the committee
19 plans to provide an opportunity for public comment on the commissioner's action at the next committee
20 meeting.
21 (b) The commissioner shall notify the economic affairs interim committee of a final determination
22 under this section. The committee shall follow the procedures in Title 2, chapter 4, if the committee decides to
23 conduct a review. A final determination of the commissioner may be suspended as provided in 2-4-305(9) by
24 the committee whether the determination is for a rule or for another board action."
