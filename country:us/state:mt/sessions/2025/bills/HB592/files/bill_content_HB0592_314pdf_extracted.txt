24 was mailed by the agency. If the proposal notice fails to state the date on which and the manner in which the
25 primary sponsor was contacted, the filing of the proposal notice under subsection (2)(a) is ineffective for the

14 contact the primary sponsor by using less than all of these three methods of contact, the other methods need
15 not be used.
16 (9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a

19
20 Section 6. Section 2-4-305, MCA, is amended to read:
21 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
22 fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
23 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
24 that initially implements legislation.
25 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
26 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
27 comments received by the means set forth in the notice, and the reasons for overruling the considerations
28 urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as proposed and as
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that rule is published in
2 the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against agency action.
3 When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of reasons.
4 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
5 by the primary sponsor, the agency shall provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments were not
6 incorporated into the adopted rule.
7 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
8 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
9 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
10 language.
11 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
12 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
13 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
14 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
15 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
16 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
17 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
18 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
19 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
20 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
21 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
22 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
23 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
24 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
25 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
26 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
27 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
28 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
2 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
3 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
4 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
5 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
6 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
7 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
8 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
9 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
10 reasonable necessity for the rule.
11 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
12 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
13 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
14 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
15 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
16 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
17 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
18 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
19 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
20 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
21 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
22 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
23 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
24 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
25 PROPOSAL for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
26 implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
27 same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
28 primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
2 (9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
3 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
4 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
5 portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
6 by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
7 adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
8 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
9 does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
10 committee's records.
11 (10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
12 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
13 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704.
14 (11)(10)(a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an agency
15 may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
16 (b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
17 (i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
18 (ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
19 policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
20 (iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
21 statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.
22 (c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
23 under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
24 precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
25 (ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
26 copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
27 the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
28 object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
2 review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
3 the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
4 objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."

6 Section 7. Section 2-4-306, MCA, is amended to read:
7 "2-4-306. Filing and format -- adoption and effective dates -- dissemination of emergency rules.
8 (1) Each agency shall file with the secretary of state a copy of each rule adopted by it or a reference to the rule
9 as contained in the proposal notice. A rule is adopted on the date that the adoption notice is filed with the
10 secretary of state and is effective on the date referred to in subsection (4), except that if the secretary of state
11 requests corrections to the adoption notice, the rule is adopted on the date that the revised notice is filed with
12 the secretary of state.
13 (2) Pursuant to 2-15-401, the secretary of state may prescribe rules to effectively administer this
14 chapter, including rules regarding the printed or electronic format, style, and arrangement for notices and rules
15 that are filed pursuant to this chapter, and may refuse to accept the filing of any notice or rule that is not in
16 compliance with this chapter and the secretary of state's rules. The secretary of state shall keep and maintain a
17 permanent register of all notices and rules filed, including superseded and repealed rules, that must be open to
18 public inspection and shall provide copies of any notice or rule upon request of any person. Unless otherwise
19 provided by statute, the secretary of state may require the payment of the cost of providing copies.
20 (3) If the appropriate administrative rule review committee has conducted a poll of the legislature in
21 accordance with 2-4-403, the results of the poll must be published with the rule if the rule is adopted by the
22 agency.
23 (4) Each rule is effective after publication in the register, as provided in 2-4-312, except that:
24 (a) if a later date is required by statute or specified in the rule, the later date is the effective date;
25 (b) subject to applicable constitutional or statutory provisions:
26 (i) a temporary rule is effective immediately upon filing with the secretary of state or at a stated
27 date following publication in the register; and
28 (ii) an emergency rule is effective at a stated date following publication in the register or
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 immediately upon filing with the secretary of state if the agency finds that this effective date is necessary
2 because of imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare. The agency's finding and a brief statement of
3 reasons for the finding must be filed with the rule. The agency shall, in addition to the required publication in the
4 register, take appropriate and extraordinary measures to make emergency rules known to each person who
5 may be affected by them.
6 (c) if, following written administrative rule review committee notification to an agency under 2-4-
7 305(9) 2-4-406, the committee meets and under 2-4-406(1)(2) formally objects to all or some portion of a
8 proposed rule before the proposed rule is adopted, the proposed rule or portion of the proposed rule objected to
9 is not effective until the day after final adjournment of the regular session of the legislature that begins after the
10 notice proposing the rule was published by the secretary of state, unless, following the committee's formal
11 objection under 2-4-406(1)(2) and subject to 2-4-112:
12 (i) the committee withdraws its objection under 2-4-406 before the proposed rule is adopted; or
13 (ii) the rule or portion of a rule objected to is adopted with changes that in the opinion of a majority
14 of the committee members, as communicated in writing to the committee presiding officer and staff, make it
15 comply with the committee's objection and concerns.
16 (5) An agency may not enforce, implement, or otherwise treat as effective a rule proposed or
17 adopted by the agency until the effective date of the rule as provided in this section. Nothing in this subsection
18 prohibits an agency from enforcing an established policy or practice of the agency that existed prior to the
19 proposal or adoption of the rule as long as the policy or practice is within the scope of the agency's lawful
20 authority.
21 (6) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
22 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
23 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704."

25 Section 8. Section 2-4-406, MCA, is amended to read:
26 "2-4-406. Committee objection to violation of authority for rule -- effect. (1) Subject to 2-4-112,

4 (c) the objecting members shall be identified in the committee’s records.
5 (d) The proposal notice to which the committee objects may not be adopted until publication of the

7 notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and does not renew the objection by
8 majority vote.
9 (2) (a) Subject to 2-4-112, the appropriate administrative rule review committee may formally
10 object to a proposed or adopted rule. if If the appropriate administrative rule review committee objects to all or
11 some portion of a proposed or adopted rule because the committee, by majority vote, considers it not to have
12 been proposed or adopted in substantial compliance with 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305, the committee shall
13 send a written objection to the agency that promulgated the rule. :
14 (i) The objection must contain that contains a concise statement of the committee's reasons for its
15 action. ;
16 (ii) that sets forth the provisions of 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305 with which the proposal does not
17 comply and the basis for belief of noncompliance; and
18 (iii) that must be included in the committee's records.
19 (b) Following notice by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the
20 committee objects to may not be adopted until:
21 (I) publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
22 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
23 does not make the same objection; OR
24 (II) AS PROVIDED IN 2-4-306(4)(C).
25 (2)(3) Within 14 days after the mailing of a committee formal objection to a rule, the agency
26 promulgating the rule shall respond in writing to the committee. After receipt of the response, the committee
27 may withdraw or modify its objection.
28 (3)(4) Subject to 2-4-112, if the committee fails to withdraw or substantially modify its formal objection
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 to a rule, it may vote to send the objection to the secretary of state, who shall, upon receipt of the objection,
2 publish the objection in the register adjacent to any notice of adoption of the rule and in the ARM adjacent to
3 the rule, provided an agency response must also be published if requested by the agency. Costs of publication
4 of the objection and the agency response must be paid by the committee.
5 (4)(5) If an a formal objection to all or a portion of a rule has been published pursuant to subsection
6 (3) (4), the agency bears the burden, in any action challenging the legality of the rule or portion of a rule
7 objected to by the committee, of proving that the rule or portion of the rule objected to was adopted in
8 substantial compliance with 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305. If a rule is invalidated by court judgment because
9 the agency failed to meet its burden of proof imposed by this subsection and the court finds that the rule was
10 adopted in arbitrary and capricious disregard for the purposes of the authorizing statute, the court may award
11 costs and reasonable attorney fees against the agency."

13 Section 9. Section 37-1-122, MCA, is amended to read:
14 "37-1-122. Active supervision -- rebuttable presumption -- reconsideration. (1) (a) Before making
15 a determination approving or disapproving a board action subject to active supervision as provided in 37-1-
16 121(1)(d), the commissioner of labor and industry shall:
17 (i) notify the affected board and the economic affairs interim committee in writing of the particular
18 action identified for commissioner review;
19 (ii) give the board a timeframe of at least 30 days in which to provide the commissioner with
20 written comments and materials justifying the proposed action; and
21 (iii) meet with the board or its representatives regarding the board action.
22 (b) The commissioner may require that the board provide the commissioner with other relevant
23 information, including but not limited to comments, documents, or other material submitted to the board
24 regarding the board action.
25 (c) The commissioner may approve a board action subject to active supervision under 37-1-
26 121(1)(d) without the notice and opportunity for board comment required under subsection (1)(a) if the
27 commissioner has sufficient information to act.
28 (2) (a) There is a rebuttable presumption that if a board has not received a written notice as
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 provided in 37-1-121(1)(d) regarding a board action within 30 days, that the board action is presumed to be
2 approved by the commissioner because the department has determined the board action will not unreasonably
3 restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition in trade or commerce.
4 (b) At any time a board may request that the department or commissioner confirm in writing that a
5 board action is not subject to active supervision under 37-1-121(1)(d) because the commissioner has
6 determined that the board action will not unreasonably restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition
7 in trade or commerce.
8 (3) If the commissioner determines that a board action is subject to active supervision procedures

26 under this section. The committee shall follow the procedures in Title 2, chapter 4, if the committee decides to

8 "Section 1. Sponsor contact for administrative rulemaking -- sponsor comments -- request for
9 economic impact statement. (1) When an agency begins to work on the substantive content of a proposal
10 notice for a rule that initially implements legislation, and not less than 10 days in advance of a proposal notice,
11 the agency shall contact the legislator who was the primary sponsor of the legislation. The primary sponsor
12 must be contacted at the sponsor's legislative e-mail address. An agency has complied with the primary
13 sponsor contact requirements of this section upon sending the e-mail meeting the requirements of this
14 subsection. If an agency fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection, then the proposal notice is
15 ineffective. The agency shall:
16 (a) inform the sponsor of known and expected dates in the rulemaking process;
17 (b) provide the sponsor a timeline to submit informal comments or to meet to discuss the
18 rulemaking; and
19 (c) invite the sponsor's explanation of the legislation's intent.
20 (2) If comments received from the sponsor are not incorporated into the rules proposed, the
21 agency shall set forth the reasons for not incorporating the comments as part of the proposal notice. If the
22 primary sponsor submits comments pursuant to subsection (1)(b) for an agency proposal and the agency
23 disagrees with the primary sponsor, the agency shall publish the primary sponsor’s unredacted comments in
24 the proposal notice and provide a statement explaining why the sponsor’s comments were not incorporated into
25 the proposed rule.
26 (3) The sponsor may request an economic impact statement be prepared pursuant to 2-4-405. The
27 request must set forth the requirements of 2-4-405(2)(a) and an explanation of whether and how the economic
28 burden of the proposed rulemaking can be mitigated while implementing the sponsor's legislation. The request
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 must be directed to the appropriate administrative rule review committee, and the provisions of 2-4-405 apply.
2 (4) The sponsor is an interested person as set forth in 2-4-302 for purposes of rulemaking that
3 initially implements legislation."

5 COORDINATION SECTION. SECTION 12. COORDINATION INSTRUCTION. IF BOTH HOUSE BILL NO. 126
6 AND [THIS ACT] ARE PASSED AND APPROVED AND IF BOTH CONTAIN A SECTION THAT AMENDS 2-4-305, THEN HOUSE BILL
7 NO. 126 AND [SECTION 6 OF THIS ACT], AMENDING 2-4-305, ARE VOID AND 2-4-305 MUST BE AMENDED AS FOLLOWS:
8 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
9 fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
10 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
11 that initially implements legislation.
12 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
13 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
14 comments received by the means set forth in the proposal notice and shall state the reasons for overruling the
15 considerations urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as
16 proposed and as adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that
17 rule is published in the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against
18 agency action. When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of
19 reasons.
20 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
21 by the primary sponsor by the means set forth in the proposal notice, the agency shall publish the sponsor's
22 unredacted comments in the adoption notice and provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments
23 were not incorporated into the adopted rule.
24 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
25 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
26 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
27 language.
28 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
2 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
3 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
4 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
5 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
6 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
7 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
8 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
9 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
10 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
11 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
12 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
13 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
14 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
15 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
16 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
17 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
18 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
19 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
20 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
21 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
22 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
23 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
24 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
25 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
26 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
27 reasonable necessity for the rule.
28 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
2 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
3 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
4 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
5 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
6 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
7 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
8 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
9 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
10 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
11 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
12 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
13 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
14 proposal for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
15 implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
16 same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
17 primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
18 comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
19 (9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
20 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
21 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
22 portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
23 by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
24 adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
25 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
26 does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
27 committee's records.
28 (10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
2 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704.
3 (11)(10)(a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an agency
4 may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
5 (b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
6 (i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
7 (ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
8 policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
9 (iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
10 statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.
11 (c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
12 under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
13 precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
14 (ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
15 copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
16 the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
17 object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
18 been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
19 review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
20 the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
21 objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."

24 was mailed by the agency. If the proposal notice fails to state the date on which and the manner in which the
25 primary sponsor was contacted, the filing of the proposal notice under subsection (2)(a) is ineffective for the
26 purposes of this part and for the purposes of the law that the agency cites in the proposal notice as the

16 affected. If the proposed rulemaking involves matters of significant interest to the public, the agency shall
17 schedule an oral hearing.
18 (5)(6) An agency may continue a hearing date for cause. In the discretion of the agency, contested

9 information from the legislator or the legislative services division. An agency proposing rules shall consult the
10 register when providing sponsor contact.

12 when the agency has attempted to reach the primary bill sponsor at the legislator's address, e-mail address,
13 and telephone number on file with the secretary of state pursuant to subsection (8)(a). If the agency is able to
14 contact the primary sponsor by using less than all of these three methods of contact, the other methods need
15 not be used.
16 (9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
17 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
18 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704."
19
20 Section 6. Section 2-4-305, MCA, is amended to read:
21 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
22 fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
23 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
24 that initially implements legislation.
25 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
26 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
27 comments received by the means set forth in the notice, and the reasons for overruling the considerations
28 urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as proposed and as
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that rule is published in
2 the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against agency action.
3 When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of reasons.
4 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
5 by the primary sponsor, the agency shall provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments were not
6 incorporated into the adopted rule.
7 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
8 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
9 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
10 language.
11 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
12 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
13 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
14 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
15 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
16 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
17 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
18 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
19 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
20 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
21 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
22 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
23 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
24 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
25 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
26 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
27 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
28 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
2 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
3 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
4 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
5 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
6 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
7 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
8 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
9 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
10 reasonable necessity for the rule.
11 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
12 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
13 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
14 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
15 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
16 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
17 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
18 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
19 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
20 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
21 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
22 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
23 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
24 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
25 PROPOSAL for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being

6 Section 7. Section 2-4-306, MCA, is amended to read:
7 "2-4-306. Filing and format -- adoption and effective dates -- dissemination of emergency rules.
8 (1) Each agency shall file with the secretary of state a copy of each rule adopted by it or a reference to the rule
9 as contained in the proposal notice. A rule is adopted on the date that the adoption notice is filed with the
10 secretary of state and is effective on the date referred to in subsection (4), except that if the secretary of state
11 requests corrections to the adoption notice, the rule is adopted on the date that the revised notice is filed with
12 the secretary of state.
13 (2) Pursuant to 2-15-401, the secretary of state may prescribe rules to effectively administer this
14 chapter, including rules regarding the printed or electronic format, style, and arrangement for notices and rules
15 that are filed pursuant to this chapter, and may refuse to accept the filing of any notice or rule that is not in
16 compliance with this chapter and the secretary of state's rules. The secretary of state shall keep and maintain a
17 permanent register of all notices and rules filed, including superseded and repealed rules, that must be open to
18 public inspection and shall provide copies of any notice or rule upon request of any person. Unless otherwise
19 provided by statute, the secretary of state may require the payment of the cost of providing copies.
20 (3) If the appropriate administrative rule review committee has conducted a poll of the legislature in
21 accordance with 2-4-403, the results of the poll must be published with the rule if the rule is adopted by the
22 agency.
23 (4) Each rule is effective after publication in the register, as provided in 2-4-312, except that:
24 (a) if a later date is required by statute or specified in the rule, the later date is the effective date;
25 (b) subject to applicable constitutional or statutory provisions:
26 (i) a temporary rule is effective immediately upon filing with the secretary of state or at a stated
27 date following publication in the register; and
28 (ii) an emergency rule is effective at a stated date following publication in the register or
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 immediately upon filing with the secretary of state if the agency finds that this effective date is necessary
2 because of imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare. The agency's finding and a brief statement of
3 reasons for the finding must be filed with the rule. The agency shall, in addition to the required publication in the
4 register, take appropriate and extraordinary measures to make emergency rules known to each person who
5 may be affected by them.
6 (c) if, following written administrative rule review committee notification to an agency under 2-4-
7 305(9) 2-4-406, the committee meets and under 2-4-406(1)(2) formally objects to all or some portion of a
8 proposed rule before the proposed rule is adopted, the proposed rule or portion of the proposed rule objected to
9 is not effective until the day after final adjournment of the regular session of the legislature that begins after the
10 notice proposing the rule was published by the secretary of state, unless, following the committee's formal
11 objection under 2-4-406(1)(2) and subject to 2-4-112:
12 (i) the committee withdraws its objection under 2-4-406 before the proposed rule is adopted; or
13 (ii) the rule or portion of a rule objected to is adopted with changes that in the opinion of a majority
14 of the committee members, as communicated in writing to the committee presiding officer and staff, make it
15 comply with the committee's objection and concerns.
16 (5) An agency may not enforce, implement, or otherwise treat as effective a rule proposed or
17 adopted by the agency until the effective date of the rule as provided in this section. Nothing in this subsection
18 prohibits an agency from enforcing an established policy or practice of the agency that existed prior to the
19 proposal or adoption of the rule as long as the policy or practice is within the scope of the agency's lawful
20 authority.
21 (6) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
22 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
23 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704."

10 object to a proposed or adopted rule. if If the appropriate administrative rule review committee objects to all or
11 some portion of a proposed or adopted rule because the committee, by majority vote, considers it not to have
12 been proposed or adopted in substantial compliance with 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305, the committee shall
13 send a written objection to the agency that promulgated the rule. :

15 action. ;
16 (ii) that sets forth the provisions of 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305 with which the proposal does not
17 comply and the basis for belief of noncompliance; and
18 (iii) that must be included in the committee's records.
19 (b) Following notice by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the
20 committee objects to may not be adopted until:
21 (I) publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
22 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
23 does not make the same objection; OR
24 (II) AS PROVIDED IN 2-4-306(4)(C).
25 (2)(3) Within 14 days after the mailing of a committee formal objection to a rule, the agency
26 promulgating the rule shall respond in writing to the committee. After receipt of the response, the committee
27 may withdraw or modify its objection.
28 (3)(4) Subject to 2-4-112, if the committee fails to withdraw or substantially modify its formal objection

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 to a rule, it may vote to send the objection to the secretary of state, who shall, upon receipt of the objection,
2 publish the objection in the register adjacent to any notice of adoption of the rule and in the ARM adjacent to
3 the rule, provided an agency response must also be published if requested by the agency. Costs of publication
4 of the objection and the agency response must be paid by the committee.
5 (4)(5) If an a formal objection to all or a portion of a rule has been published pursuant to subsection
6 (3) (4), the agency bears the burden, in any action challenging the legality of the rule or portion of a rule
7 objected to by the committee, of proving that the rule or portion of the rule objected to was adopted in
8 substantial compliance with 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305. If a rule is invalidated by court judgment because
9 the agency failed to meet its burden of proof imposed by this subsection and the court finds that the rule was
10 adopted in arbitrary and capricious disregard for the purposes of the authorizing statute, the court may award
11 costs and reasonable attorney fees against the agency."

13 Section 9. Section 37-1-122, MCA, is amended to read:
14 "37-1-122. Active supervision -- rebuttable presumption -- reconsideration. (1) (a) Before making
15 a determination approving or disapproving a board action subject to active supervision as provided in 37-1-
16 121(1)(d), the commissioner of labor and industry shall:

22 (b) The commissioner may require that the board provide the commissioner with other relevant
23 information, including but not limited to comments, documents, or other material submitted to the board
24 regarding the board action.
25 (c) The commissioner may approve a board action subject to active supervision under 37-1-
26 121(1)(d) without the notice and opportunity for board comment required under subsection (1)(a) if the

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 provided in 37-1-121(1)(d) regarding a board action within 30 days, that the board action is presumed to be
2 approved by the commissioner because the department has determined the board action will not unreasonably
3 restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition in trade or commerce.
4 (b) At any time a board may request that the department or commissioner confirm in writing that a
5 board action is not subject to active supervision under 37-1-121(1)(d) because the commissioner has

8 "Section 1. Sponsor contact for administrative rulemaking -- sponsor comments -- request for
9 economic impact statement. (1) When an agency begins to work on the substantive content of a proposal
10 notice for a rule that initially implements legislation, and not less than 10 days in advance of a proposal notice,
11 the agency shall contact the legislator who was the primary sponsor of the legislation. The primary sponsor
12 must be contacted at the sponsor's legislative e-mail address. An agency has complied with the primary
13 sponsor contact requirements of this section upon sending the e-mail meeting the requirements of this
14 subsection. If an agency fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection, then the proposal notice is
15 ineffective. The agency shall:
16 (a) inform the sponsor of known and expected dates in the rulemaking process;
17 (b) provide the sponsor a timeline to submit informal comments or to meet to discuss the
18 rulemaking; and
19 (c) invite the sponsor's explanation of the legislation's intent.
20 (2) If comments received from the sponsor are not incorporated into the rules proposed, the

1 must be directed to the appropriate administrative rule review committee, and the provisions of 2-4-405 apply.

6 AND [THIS ACT] ARE PASSED AND APPROVED AND IF BOTH CONTAIN A SECTION THAT AMENDS 2-4-305, THEN HOUSE BILL
7 NO. 126 AND [SECTION 6 OF THIS ACT], AMENDING 2-4-305, ARE VOID AND 2-4-305 MUST BE AMENDED AS FOLLOWS:
8 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
9 fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
10 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
11 that initially implements legislation.
12 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
13 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
14 comments received by the means set forth in the proposal notice and shall state the reasons for overruling the
15 considerations urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as
16 proposed and as adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that
17 rule is published in the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against
18 agency action. When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of
19 reasons.
20 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
21 by the primary sponsor by the means set forth in the proposal notice, the agency shall publish the sponsor's
22 unredacted comments in the adoption notice and provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments
23 were not incorporated into the adopted rule.
24 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
25 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
26 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
27 language.
28 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
2 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
3 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
4 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
5 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
6 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
7 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
8 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
9 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
10 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
11 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
12 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
13 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
14 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
15 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
16 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
17 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
18 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
19 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
20 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
21 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
22 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
23 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
24 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
25 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
26 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
27 reasonable necessity for the rule.
28 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
2 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
3 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
4 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
5 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
6 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
7 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
8 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
9 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
10 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
11 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
12 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
13 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
14 proposal for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
15 implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
16 same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
17 primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
18 comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
19 (9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
20 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
21 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
22 portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
23 by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
24 adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
25 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
26 does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
27 committee's records.
28 (10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a

69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3

3 (11)(10)(a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an agency
4 may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
5 (b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
6 (i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
7 (ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
8 policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
9 (iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
10 statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.
11 (c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
12 under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
13 precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
14 (ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
15 copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
16 the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
17 object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
18 been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
19 review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
20 the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
21 objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."
