11
12 Section 6. Section 2-4-305, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
14 fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
15 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
16 that initially implements legislation.
17 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
18 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
19 comments received by the means set forth in the notice, and the reasons for overruling the considerations
20 urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as proposed and as
21 adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that rule is published in
22 the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against agency action.
23 When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of reasons.
24 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
25 by the primary sponsor, the agency shall provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments were not
26 incorporated into the adopted rule.
27 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
28 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
- 9 - LC 3348

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 3348
1 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
2 language.
3 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
4 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
5 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
6 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
7 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
8 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
9 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
10 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
11 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
12 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
13 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
14 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
15 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
16 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
17 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
18 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
19 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
20 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
21 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
22 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
23 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
24 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
25 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
26 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
27 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
28 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
- 10 - LC 3348

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 3348
1 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
2 reasonable necessity for the rule.
3 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
4 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
5 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
6 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
7 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
8 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
9 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
10 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
11 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
12 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
13 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
14 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
15 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
16 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
17 for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being implemented, or of a
18 clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the same interested
19 persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if primary sponsor
20 notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered comments or
21 appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
22 (9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
23 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
24 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
25 portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
26 by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
27 adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
28 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and

69th Legislature 2025 LC 3348
1 does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
2 committee's records.
3 (10) (9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
4 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
5 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704.
6 (11) (10) (a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an
7 agency may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
8 (b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
9 (i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
10 (ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
11 policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
12 (iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
13 statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.
14 (c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
15 under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
16 precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
17 (ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
18 copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
19 the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
20 object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
21 been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
22 review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
23 the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
24 objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."
