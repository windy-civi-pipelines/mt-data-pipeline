1 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
2 fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
3 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
4 that initially implements legislation.
5 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
6 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
7 comments received by the means set forth in the notice, and the reasons for overruling the considerations
8 urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as proposed and as
9 adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that rule is published in
10 the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against agency action.
11 When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of reasons.
12 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
13 by the primary sponsor, the agency shall provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments were not
14 incorporated into the adopted rule.
15 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
16 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
17 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
18 language.
19 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
20 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
21 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
22 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
23 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
24 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
25 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
26 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
27 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Matthew Weaver, HB0592.002.001
1 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
2 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
3 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
4 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
5 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
6 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
7 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
8 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
9 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
10 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
11 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
12 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
13 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
14 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
15 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
16 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
17 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
18 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
19 reasonable necessity for the rule.
20 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
21 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
22 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
23 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
24 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
25 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
26 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
27 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with

2 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
3 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
4 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not

7 PROPOSAL for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being

11 plans to provide an opportunity for public comment on the commissioner's action at the next committee
12 meeting.

1 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
2 fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
3 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
4 that initially implements legislation.
5 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
6 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
7 comments received by the means set forth in the notice, and the reasons for overruling the considerations
8 urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as proposed and as
9 adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that rule is published in
10 the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against agency action.
11 When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of reasons.
12 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
13 by the primary sponsor, the agency shall provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments were not
14 incorporated into the adopted rule.
15 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
16 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
17 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
18 language.
19 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
20 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
21 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
22 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
23 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
24 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
25 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
26 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.

1 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
2 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
3 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
4 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
5 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
6 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
7 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
8 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
9 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
10 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
11 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
12 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
13 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
14 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
15 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
16 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
17 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
18 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
19 reasonable necessity for the rule.
20 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
21 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
22 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
23 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
24 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
25 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
26 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
27 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with

10 primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
11 comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.

13 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
14 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
15 portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
16 by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
17 adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
18 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
19 does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
20 committee's records.
21 (10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
22 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of

5 (c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required

7 precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
8 (ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
9 copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
10 the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
11 object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
12 been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
13 review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
