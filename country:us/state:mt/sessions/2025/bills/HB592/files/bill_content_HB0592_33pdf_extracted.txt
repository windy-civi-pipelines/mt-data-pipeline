24 primary sponsor was contacted, the filing of the proposal notice under subsection (2)(a) is ineffective for the
25 purposes of this part and for the purposes of the law that the agency cites in the proposal notice as the

15 (9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
16 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
17 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704."
18
19 Section 6. Section 2-4-305, MCA, is amended to read:
20 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
21 fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
22 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
23 that initially implements legislation.
24 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
25 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
26 comments received by the means set forth in the notice, and the reasons for overruling the considerations
27 urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as proposed and as
28 adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that rule is published in
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against agency action.
2 When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of reasons.
3 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
4 by the primary sponsor, the agency shall provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments were not
5 incorporated into the adopted rule.
6 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
7 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
8 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
9 language.
10 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
11 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
12 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
13 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
14 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
15 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
16 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
17 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
18 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
19 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
20 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
21 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
22 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
23 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
24 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
25 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
26 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
27 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
28 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
2 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
3 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
4 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
5 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
6 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
7 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
8 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
9 reasonable necessity for the rule.
10 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
11 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
12 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
13 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
14 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
15 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
16 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
17 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
18 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
19 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
20 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
21 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
22 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
23 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
24 PROPOSAL for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
25 implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
26 same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
27 primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
28 comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.

1 (9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
2 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
3 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
4 portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
5 by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
6 adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
7 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
8 does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
9 committee's records.
10 (10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
11 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
12 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704.
13 (11)(10)(a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an agency
14 may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
15 (b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
16 (i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
17 (ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
18 policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
19 (iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
20 statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.
21 (c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
22 under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
23 precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
24 (ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
25 copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
26 the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
27 object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
28 been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day

5 Section 7. Section 2-4-306, MCA, is amended to read:
6 "2-4-306. Filing and format -- adoption and effective dates -- dissemination of emergency rules.
7 (1) Each agency shall file with the secretary of state a copy of each rule adopted by it or a reference to the rule
8 as contained in the proposal notice. A rule is adopted on the date that the adoption notice is filed with the
9 secretary of state and is effective on the date referred to in subsection (4), except that if the secretary of state
10 requests corrections to the adoption notice, the rule is adopted on the date that the revised notice is filed with
11 the secretary of state.
12 (2) Pursuant to 2-15-401, the secretary of state may prescribe rules to effectively administer this
13 chapter, including rules regarding the printed or electronic format, style, and arrangement for notices and rules
14 that are filed pursuant to this chapter, and may refuse to accept the filing of any notice or rule that is not in
15 compliance with this chapter and the secretary of state's rules. The secretary of state shall keep and maintain a
16 permanent register of all notices and rules filed, including superseded and repealed rules, that must be open to
17 public inspection and shall provide copies of any notice or rule upon request of any person. Unless otherwise
18 provided by statute, the secretary of state may require the payment of the cost of providing copies.
19 (3) If the appropriate administrative rule review committee has conducted a poll of the legislature in
20 accordance with 2-4-403, the results of the poll must be published with the rule if the rule is adopted by the
21 agency.
22 (4) Each rule is effective after publication in the register, as provided in 2-4-312, except that:
23 (a) if a later date is required by statute or specified in the rule, the later date is the effective date;
24 (b) subject to applicable constitutional or statutory provisions:
25 (i) a temporary rule is effective immediately upon filing with the secretary of state or at a stated
26 date following publication in the register; and
27 (ii) an emergency rule is effective at a stated date following publication in the register or
28 immediately upon filing with the secretary of state if the agency finds that this effective date is necessary
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 because of imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare. The agency's finding and a brief statement of
2 reasons for the finding must be filed with the rule. The agency shall, in addition to the required publication in the
3 register, take appropriate and extraordinary measures to make emergency rules known to each person who
4 may be affected by them.
5 (c) if, following written administrative rule review committee notification to an agency under 2-4-
6 305(9) 2-4-406, the committee meets and under 2-4-406(1)(2) formally objects to all or some portion of a
7 proposed rule before the proposed rule is adopted, the proposed rule or portion of the proposed rule objected to
8 is not effective until the day after final adjournment of the regular session of the legislature that begins after the
9 notice proposing the rule was published by the secretary of state, unless, following the committee's formal
10 objection under 2-4-406(1)(2) and subject to 2-4-112:
11 (i) the committee withdraws its objection under 2-4-406 before the proposed rule is adopted; or
12 (ii) the rule or portion of a rule objected to is adopted with changes that in the opinion of a majority
13 of the committee members, as communicated in writing to the committee presiding officer and staff, make it
14 comply with the committee's objection and concerns.
15 (5) An agency may not enforce, implement, or otherwise treat as effective a rule proposed or
16 adopted by the agency until the effective date of the rule as provided in this section. Nothing in this subsection
17 prohibits an agency from enforcing an established policy or practice of the agency that existed prior to the
18 proposal or adoption of the rule as long as the policy or practice is within the scope of the agency's lawful
19 authority.
20 (6) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
21 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
22 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704."
23
24 Section 8. Section 2-4-406, MCA, is amended to read:
25 "2-4-406. Committee objection to violation of authority for rule -- effect. (1) Subject to 2-4-112,
26 the appropriate administrative rule review committee may informally object to a notice of proposed rulemaking.

28 presiding officer that they object to all or a portion of a notice of proposed rulemaking:
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025

2 (b) the committee shall address the objections at the next committee meeting; and
3 (c) the objecting members shall be identified in the committee’s records.
4 (d) The proposal notice to which the committee objects may not be adopted until publication of the
5 last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month period during which the adoption
6 notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and does not renew the objection by
7 majority vote.
8 (2) (a) Subject to 2-4-112, the appropriate administrative rule review committee may formally
9 object to a proposed or adopted rule. if If the appropriate administrative rule review committee objects to all or
10 some portion of a proposed or adopted rule because the committee, by majority vote, considers it not to have
11 been proposed or adopted in substantial compliance with 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305, the committee shall
12 send a written objection to the agency that promulgated the rule. :
13 (i) The objection must contain that contains a concise statement of the committee's reasons for its
14 action. ;
15 (ii) that sets forth the provisions of 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305 with which the proposal does not
16 comply and the basis for belief of noncompliance; and
17 (iii) that must be included in the committee's records.
18 (b) Following notice by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the
19 committee objects to may not be adopted until:
20 (I) publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
21 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
22 does not make the same objection; OR
23 (II) AS PROVIDED IN 2-4-306(4)(C).
24 (2)(3) Within 14 days after the mailing of a committee formal objection to a rule, the agency
25 promulgating the rule shall respond in writing to the committee. After receipt of the response, the committee
26 may withdraw or modify its objection.
27 (3)(4) Subject to 2-4-112, if the committee fails to withdraw or substantially modify its formal objection
28 to a rule, it may vote to send the objection to the secretary of state, who shall, upon receipt of the objection,
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 publish the objection in the register adjacent to any notice of adoption of the rule and in the ARM adjacent to
2 the rule, provided an agency response must also be published if requested by the agency. Costs of publication
3 of the objection and the agency response must be paid by the committee.
4 (4)(5) If an a formal objection to all or a portion of a rule has been published pursuant to subsection
5 (3) (4), the agency bears the burden, in any action challenging the legality of the rule or portion of a rule
6 objected to by the committee, of proving that the rule or portion of the rule objected to was adopted in
7 substantial compliance with 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305. If a rule is invalidated by court judgment because
8 the agency failed to meet its burden of proof imposed by this subsection and the court finds that the rule was
9 adopted in arbitrary and capricious disregard for the purposes of the authorizing statute, the court may award
10 costs and reasonable attorney fees against the agency."

12 Section 9. Section 37-1-122, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "37-1-122. Active supervision -- rebuttable presumption -- reconsideration. (1) (a) Before making
14 a determination approving or disapproving a board action subject to active supervision as provided in 37-1-
15 121(1)(d), the commissioner of labor and industry shall:
16 (i) notify the affected board and the economic affairs interim committee in writing of the particular
17 action identified for commissioner review;
18 (ii) give the board a timeframe of at least 30 days in which to provide the commissioner with
19 written comments and materials justifying the proposed action; and
20 (iii) meet with the board or its representatives regarding the board action.
21 (b) The commissioner may require that the board provide the commissioner with other relevant
22 information, including but not limited to comments, documents, or other material submitted to the board
23 regarding the board action.
24 (c) The commissioner may approve a board action subject to active supervision under 37-1-
25 121(1)(d) without the notice and opportunity for board comment required under subsection (1)(a) if the
26 commissioner has sufficient information to act.
27 (2) (a) There is a rebuttable presumption that if a board has not received a written notice as
28 provided in 37-1-121(1)(d) regarding a board action within 30 days, that the board action is presumed to be
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 approved by the commissioner because the department has determined the board action will not unreasonably
2 restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition in trade or commerce.
3 (b) At any time a board may request that the department or commissioner confirm in writing that a
4 board action is not subject to active supervision under 37-1-121(1)(d) because the commissioner has
5 determined that the board action will not unreasonably restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition
6 in trade or commerce.
7 (3) If the commissioner determines that a board action is subject to active supervision procedures

23 meeting.
24 (b) The commissioner shall notify the economic affairs interim committee of a final determination
25 under this section. The committee shall follow the procedures in Title 2, chapter 4, if the committee decides to

7 "Section 1. Sponsor contact for administrative rulemaking -- sponsor comments -- request for
8 economic impact statement. (1) When an agency begins to work on the substantive content of a proposal
9 notice for a rule that initially implements legislation, AND NOT LESS THAN 10 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF A PROPOSAL
10 NOTICE, the agency shall contact the legislator who was the primary sponsor of the legislation. The primary
11 sponsor must be contacted at the sponsor's legislative e-mail address. An agency has complied with the
12 primary sponsor contact requirements of this section upon sending the e-mail meeting the requirements of this
13 subsection. IF AN AGENCY FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SUBSECTION, THEN THE PROPOSAL
14 NOTICE IS INEFFECTIVE. The agency shall:
15 (a) inform the sponsor of known and expected dates in the rulemaking process;
16 (b) provide the sponsor a timeline to submit informal comments or to meet to discuss the
17 rulemaking; and
18 (c) invite the sponsor's explanation of the legislation's intent.

5 AND [THIS ACT] ARE PASSED AND APPROVED AND IF BOTH CONTAIN A SECTION THAT AMENDS 2-4-305, THEN HOUSE BILL
6 NO. 126 AND [SECTION 6 OF THIS ACT], AMENDING 2-4-305, ARE VOID AND 2-4-305 MUST BE AMENDED AS FOLLOWS:
7 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall fully
8 consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
9 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
10 that initially implements legislation.
11 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
12 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
13 comments received by the means set forth in the proposal notice and shall state the reasons for overruling the
14 considerations urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as
15 proposed and as adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that
16 rule is published in the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against
17 agency action. When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of
18 reasons.
19 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
20 by the primary sponsor by the means set forth in the proposal notice, the agency shall publish the sponsor's
21 unredacted comments in the adoption notice and provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments
22 were not incorporated into the adopted rule.
23 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
24 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
25 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
26 language.
27 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
28 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
2 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
3 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
4 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
5 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
6 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
7 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
8 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
9 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
10 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
11 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
12 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
13 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
14 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
15 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
16 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
17 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
18 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
19 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
20 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
21 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
22 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
23 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
24 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
25 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
26 reasonable necessity for the rule.
27 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
28 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
2 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
3 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
4 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
5 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
6 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
7 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
8 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
9 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
10 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
11 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
12 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
13 proposal for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
14 implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
15 same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
16 primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
17 comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
18 (9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
19 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
20 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
21 portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
22 by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
23 adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
24 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
25 does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
26 committee's records.
27 (10) (9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
28 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of

2 (11) (10) (a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an
3 agency may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
4 (b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
5 (i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
6 (ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
7 policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
8 (iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
9 statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.
10 (c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
11 under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
12 precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
13 (ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
14 copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
15 the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
16 object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
17 been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
18 review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
19 the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
20 objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."

23 was mailed by the agency. If the proposal notice fails to state the date on which and the manner in which the
24 primary sponsor was contacted, the filing of the proposal notice under subsection (2)(a) is ineffective for the
25 purposes of this part and for the purposes of the law that the agency cites in the proposal notice as the

15 affected. If the proposed rulemaking involves matters of significant interest to the public, the agency shall
16 schedule an oral hearing.
17 (5)(6) An agency may continue a hearing date for cause. In the discretion of the agency, contested

21 agency again proposes the same rule for adoption, amendment, or repeal, the proposal must be considered a

5 address, and telephone number on file with the secretary of state. The secretary of state may also use
6 legislator contact information provided by the legislative services division for the purposes of the register. The
7 secretary of state shall update the contact information whenever the secretary of state receives corrected
8 information from the legislator or the legislative services division. An agency proposing rules shall consult the
9 register when providing sponsor contact.

11 when the agency has attempted to reach the primary bill sponsor at the legislator's address, e-mail address,
12 and telephone number on file with the secretary of state pursuant to subsection (8)(a). If the agency is able to
13 contact the primary sponsor by using less than all of these three methods of contact, the other methods need
14 not be used.
15 (9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
16 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
17 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704."
18
19 Section 6. Section 2-4-305, MCA, is amended to read:
20 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
21 fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
22 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
23 that initially implements legislation.
24 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
25 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
26 comments received by the means set forth in the notice, and the reasons for overruling the considerations
27 urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as proposed and as
28 adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that rule is published in
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against agency action.
2 When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of reasons.
3 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
4 by the primary sponsor, the agency shall provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments were not
5 incorporated into the adopted rule.
6 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
7 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
8 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
9 language.
10 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
11 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
12 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
13 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
14 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
15 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
16 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
17 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
18 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
19 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
20 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
21 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
22 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
23 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
24 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
25 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
26 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
27 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
28 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
2 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
3 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
4 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
5 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
6 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
7 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
8 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
9 reasonable necessity for the rule.
10 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
11 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
12 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
13 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
14 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
15 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
16 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
17 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
18 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
19 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
20 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
21 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
22 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.

6 "2-4-306. Filing and format -- adoption and effective dates -- dissemination of emergency rules.
7 (1) Each agency shall file with the secretary of state a copy of each rule adopted by it or a reference to the rule
8 as contained in the proposal notice. A rule is adopted on the date that the adoption notice is filed with the
9 secretary of state and is effective on the date referred to in subsection (4), except that if the secretary of state
10 requests corrections to the adoption notice, the rule is adopted on the date that the revised notice is filed with
11 the secretary of state.
12 (2) Pursuant to 2-15-401, the secretary of state may prescribe rules to effectively administer this
13 chapter, including rules regarding the printed or electronic format, style, and arrangement for notices and rules
14 that are filed pursuant to this chapter, and may refuse to accept the filing of any notice or rule that is not in
15 compliance with this chapter and the secretary of state's rules. The secretary of state shall keep and maintain a
16 permanent register of all notices and rules filed, including superseded and repealed rules, that must be open to
17 public inspection and shall provide copies of any notice or rule upon request of any person. Unless otherwise
18 provided by statute, the secretary of state may require the payment of the cost of providing copies.
19 (3) If the appropriate administrative rule review committee has conducted a poll of the legislature in
20 accordance with 2-4-403, the results of the poll must be published with the rule if the rule is adopted by the
21 agency.
22 (4) Each rule is effective after publication in the register, as provided in 2-4-312, except that:
23 (a) if a later date is required by statute or specified in the rule, the later date is the effective date;
24 (b) subject to applicable constitutional or statutory provisions:
25 (i) a temporary rule is effective immediately upon filing with the secretary of state or at a stated
26 date following publication in the register; and
27 (ii) an emergency rule is effective at a stated date following publication in the register or

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 because of imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare. The agency's finding and a brief statement of
2 reasons for the finding must be filed with the rule. The agency shall, in addition to the required publication in the
3 register, take appropriate and extraordinary measures to make emergency rules known to each person who
4 may be affected by them.
5 (c) if, following written administrative rule review committee notification to an agency under 2-4-
6 305(9) 2-4-406, the committee meets and under 2-4-406(1)(2) formally objects to all or some portion of a
7 proposed rule before the proposed rule is adopted, the proposed rule or portion of the proposed rule objected to
8 is not effective until the day after final adjournment of the regular session of the legislature that begins after the
9 notice proposing the rule was published by the secretary of state, unless, following the committee's formal
10 objection under 2-4-406(1)(2) and subject to 2-4-112:
11 (i) the committee withdraws its objection under 2-4-406 before the proposed rule is adopted; or
12 (ii) the rule or portion of a rule objected to is adopted with changes that in the opinion of a majority
13 of the committee members, as communicated in writing to the committee presiding officer and staff, make it
14 comply with the committee's objection and concerns.
15 (5) An agency may not enforce, implement, or otherwise treat as effective a rule proposed or
16 adopted by the agency until the effective date of the rule as provided in this section. Nothing in this subsection
17 prohibits an agency from enforcing an established policy or practice of the agency that existed prior to the
18 proposal or adoption of the rule as long as the policy or practice is within the scope of the agency's lawful
19 authority.
20 (6) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
21 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
22 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704."

9 object to a proposed or adopted rule. if If the appropriate administrative rule review committee objects to all or
10 some portion of a proposed or adopted rule because the committee, by majority vote, considers it not to have
11 been proposed or adopted in substantial compliance with 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305, the committee shall
12 send a written objection to the agency that promulgated the rule. :
13 (i) The objection must contain that contains a concise statement of the committee's reasons for its
14 action. ;
15 (ii) that sets forth the provisions of 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305 with which the proposal does not
16 comply and the basis for belief of noncompliance; and
17 (iii) that must be included in the committee's records.
18 (b) Following notice by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the
19 committee objects to may not be adopted until:
20 (I) publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
21 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
22 does not make the same objection; OR

24 (2)(3) Within 14 days after the mailing of a committee formal objection to a rule, the agency
25 promulgating the rule shall respond in writing to the committee. After receipt of the response, the committee
26 may withdraw or modify its objection.
27 (3)(4) Subject to 2-4-112, if the committee fails to withdraw or substantially modify its formal objection
28 to a rule, it may vote to send the objection to the secretary of state, who shall, upon receipt of the objection,

69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 publish the objection in the register adjacent to any notice of adoption of the rule and in the ARM adjacent to
2 the rule, provided an agency response must also be published if requested by the agency. Costs of publication
3 of the objection and the agency response must be paid by the committee.
4 (4)(5) If an a formal objection to all or a portion of a rule has been published pursuant to subsection
5 (3) (4), the agency bears the burden, in any action challenging the legality of the rule or portion of a rule
6 objected to by the committee, of proving that the rule or portion of the rule objected to was adopted in
7 substantial compliance with 2-4-302, 2-4-303, and 2-4-305. If a rule is invalidated by court judgment because
8 the agency failed to meet its burden of proof imposed by this subsection and the court finds that the rule was
9 adopted in arbitrary and capricious disregard for the purposes of the authorizing statute, the court may award
10 costs and reasonable attorney fees against the agency."

12 Section 9. Section 37-1-122, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "37-1-122. Active supervision -- rebuttable presumption -- reconsideration. (1) (a) Before making
14 a determination approving or disapproving a board action subject to active supervision as provided in 37-1-
15 121(1)(d), the commissioner of labor and industry shall:

17 action identified for commissioner review;
18 (ii) give the board a timeframe of at least 30 days in which to provide the commissioner with
19 written comments and materials justifying the proposed action; and
20 (iii) meet with the board or its representatives regarding the board action.
21 (b) The commissioner may require that the board provide the commissioner with other relevant

24 (c) The commissioner may approve a board action subject to active supervision under 37-1-
25 121(1)(d) without the notice and opportunity for board comment required under subsection (1)(a) if the

69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 approved by the commissioner because the department has determined the board action will not unreasonably
2 restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition in trade or commerce.
3 (b) At any time a board may request that the department or commissioner confirm in writing that a
4 board action is not subject to active supervision under 37-1-121(1)(d) because the commissioner has

7 "Section 1. Sponsor contact for administrative rulemaking -- sponsor comments -- request for
8 economic impact statement. (1) When an agency begins to work on the substantive content of a proposal
9 notice for a rule that initially implements legislation, AND NOT LESS THAN 10 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF A PROPOSAL
10 NOTICE, the agency shall contact the legislator who was the primary sponsor of the legislation. The primary
11 sponsor must be contacted at the sponsor's legislative e-mail address. An agency has complied with the
12 primary sponsor contact requirements of this section upon sending the e-mail meeting the requirements of this
13 subsection. IF AN AGENCY FAILS TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS SUBSECTION, THEN THE PROPOSAL
14 NOTICE IS INEFFECTIVE. The agency shall:

6 NO. 126 AND [SECTION 6 OF THIS ACT], AMENDING 2-4-305, ARE VOID AND 2-4-305 MUST BE AMENDED AS FOLLOWS:
7 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall fully
8 consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
9 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
10 that initially implements legislation.
11 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
12 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
13 comments received by the means set forth in the proposal notice and shall state the reasons for overruling the
14 considerations urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as
15 proposed and as adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that
16 rule is published in the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against
17 agency action. When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of
18 reasons.
19 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
20 by the primary sponsor by the means set forth in the proposal notice, the agency shall publish the sponsor's
21 unredacted comments in the adoption notice and provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments
22 were not incorporated into the adopted rule.
23 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
24 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
25 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
26 language.
27 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
28 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
2 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
3 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
4 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
5 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
6 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
7 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
8 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
9 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
10 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
11 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
12 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
13 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
14 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
15 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
16 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
17 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
18 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
19 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
20 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
21 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
22 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
23 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
24 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
25 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
26 reasonable necessity for the rule.
27 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
28 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 592

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0592.3
1 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
2 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
3 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
4 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
5 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
6 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
7 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
8 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
9 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
10 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
11 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
12 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
13 proposal for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
14 implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
15 same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
16 primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
17 comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
18 (9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
19 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
20 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
21 portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
22 by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
23 adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
24 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
25 does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
26 committee's records.
27 (10) (9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
28 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of

2 (11) (10) (a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an
3 agency may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
4 (b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
5 (i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
6 (ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
7 policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
8 (iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
9 statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.
10 (c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
11 under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
12 precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
13 (ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
14 copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
15 the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
16 object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
17 been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
18 review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
19 the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
20 objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."
