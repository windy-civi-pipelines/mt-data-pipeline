1 that initially implements legislation.
2 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
3 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement fairly summarize and respond to the substance of
4 comments received by the means set forth in the notice, and the reasons for overruling the considerations
5 urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as proposed and as
6 adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that rule is published in
7 the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against agency action.
8 When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of reasons.
9 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
10 by the primary sponsor, the agency shall provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments were not
11 incorporated into the adopted rule.
12 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
13 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
14 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
15 language.
16 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
17 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
18 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
19 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
20 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
21 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
22 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
23 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
24 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
25 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
26 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
27 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.

1 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
2 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
3 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
4 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
5 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
6 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
7 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
8 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
9 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
10 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
11 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
12 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
13 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
14 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
15 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
16 reasonable necessity for the rule.
17 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
18 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
19 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
20 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
21 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
22 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
23 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
24 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
25 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
26 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
27 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.

1 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
2 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
3 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
4 PROPOSAL for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
5 implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
6 same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if

13 provided in 37-1-121(1)(d) regarding a board action within 30 days, that the board action is presumed to be

15 restrain or potentially unreasonably restrain competition in trade or commerce.
16 (b) At any time a board may request that the department or commissioner confirm in writing that a
17 board action is not subject to active supervision under 37-1-121(1)(d) because the commissioner has

7 agency shall set forth the reasons for not incorporating the comments as part of the proposal notice. If the
8 primary sponsor submits comments pursuant to subsection (1)(b) for an agency proposal and the agency
9 disagrees with the primary sponsor, the agency shall publish the primary sponsor’s unredacted comments in
10 the proposal notice and provide a statement explaining why the sponsor’s comments were not incorporated into
11 the proposed rule.
12 (3) The sponsor may request an economic impact statement be prepared pursuant to 2-4-405. The
13 request must set forth the requirements of 2-4-405(2)(a) and an explanation of whether and how the economic
14 burden of the proposed rulemaking can be mitigated while implementing the sponsor's legislation. The request
15 must be directed to the appropriate administrative rule review committee, and the provisions of 2-4-405 apply.

21 and [section 6 of this act], amending 2-4-305, are void and 2-4-305 must be amended as follows:
22 "2-4-305. Requisites for validity -- authority and statement of reasons. (1) (a) The agency shall
23 fully consider written and oral submissions respecting the proposed rule, including comments submitted by the
24 primary sponsor of the legislation prior to the drafting of the substantive content and wording of a proposed rule
25 that initially implements legislation.

1 comments received by the means set forth in the proposal notice and shall state the reasons for overruling the
2 considerations urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as
3 proposed and as adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that
4 rule is published in the register, the differences must be described in the statement of reasons for and against
5 agency action. When written or oral submissions have not been received, an agency may omit the statement of
6 reasons.
7 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
8 by the primary sponsor by the means set forth in the proposal notice, the agency shall publish the sponsor's
9 unredacted comments in the adoption notice and provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments
10 were not incorporated into the adopted rule.
11 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
12 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
13 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
14 language.
15 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
16 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
17 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
18 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
19 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
20 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
21 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
22 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
23 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
24 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
25 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
26 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.
27 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred

1 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
2 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
3 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
4 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
5 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
6 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
7 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
8 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
9 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
10 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
11 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
12 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
13 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
14 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
15 reasonable necessity for the rule.
16 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
17 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
18 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
19 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
20 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
21 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
22 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
23 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
24 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
25 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
26 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
27 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not

1 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
2 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
3 proposal for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
4 implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
5 same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
6 primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
7 comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
8 (9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
9 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
10 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
11 portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
12 by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
13 adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
14 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
15 does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
16 committee's records.
17 (10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
18 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
19 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704.
20 (11)(10)(a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an agency
21 may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
22 (b) This subsection (11)(10) does not apply to:
23 (i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
24 (ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
25 policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
26 (iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
27 statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.

9 (ii) If an adopted rule that initially implements legislation does not reflect the comments submitted
10 by the primary sponsor, the agency shall provide a statement explaining why the sponsor's comments were not
11 incorporated into the adopted rule.
12 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to
13 statutory language in order to convey the meaning of a rule interpreting the language, the reference must
14 clearly indicate the portion of the language that is statutory and the portion that is an amplification of the
15 language.
16 (3) Each proposed and adopted rule must include a citation to the specific grant of rulemaking
17 authority pursuant to which the rule or any part of the rule is adopted. In addition, each proposed and adopted
18 rule must include a citation to the specific section or sections in the Montana Code Annotated that the rule
19 purports to implement. A substantive rule may not be proposed or adopted unless:
20 (a) a statute granting the agency authority to adopt rules clearly and specifically lists the subject
21 matter of the rule as a subject upon which the agency shall or may adopt rules; or
22 (b) the rule implements and relates to a subject matter or an agency function that is clearly and
23 specifically included in a statute to which the grant of rulemaking authority extends.
24 (4) Each rule that is proposed and adopted by an agency and that implements a policy of a
25 governing board or commission must include a citation to and description of the policy implemented. Each
26 agency rule implementing a policy and the policy itself must be based on legal authority and otherwise comply
27 with the requisites for validity of rules established by this chapter.

1 (5) To be effective, each substantive rule adopted must be within the scope of authority conferred
2 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
3 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
4 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
5 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
6 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
7 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
8 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
9 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
10 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
11 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
12 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
13 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
14 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
15 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
16 reasonable necessity for the rule.
17 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
18 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
19 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
20 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
21 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
22 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
23 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
24 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
25 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
26 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
27 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.

1 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not
2 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
3 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
4 PROPOSAL for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
5 implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
6 same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
7 primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
8 comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
9 (9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
10 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
11 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
12 portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
13 by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
14 adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
15 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
16 does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
17 committee's records.
18 (10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
19 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
20 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704.
21 (11)(10)(a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an agency
22 may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
23 (b) This subsection (11) (10) does not apply to:
24 (i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
25 (ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
26 policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or

2 (c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
3 under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
4 precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
5 (ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
6 copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
7 the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
8 object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
9 been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
10 review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
11 the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
12 objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."

16 (1) Each agency shall file with the secretary of state a copy of each rule adopted by it or a reference to the rule
17 as contained in the proposal notice. A rule is adopted on the date that the adoption notice is filed with the
18 secretary of state and is effective on the date referred to in subsection (4), except that if the secretary of state
19 requests corrections to the adoption notice, the rule is adopted on the date that the revised notice is filed with
20 the secretary of state.
21 (2) Pursuant to 2-15-401, the secretary of state may prescribe rules to effectively administer this
22 chapter, including rules regarding the printed or electronic format, style, and arrangement for notices and rules
23 that are filed pursuant to this chapter, and may refuse to accept the filing of any notice or rule that is not in
24 compliance with this chapter and the secretary of state's rules. The secretary of state shall keep and maintain a
25 permanent register of all notices and rules filed, including superseded and repealed rules, that must be open to
26 public inspection and shall provide copies of any notice or rule upon request of any person. Unless otherwise
27 provided by statute, the secretary of state may require the payment of the cost of providing copies.

2 accordance with 2-4-403, the results of the poll must be published with the rule if the rule is adopted by the
3 agency.

18 is not effective until the day after final adjournment of the regular session of the legislature that begins after the
19 notice proposing the rule was published by the secretary of state, unless, following the committee's formal

1 comments received by the means set forth in the proposal notice and shall state the reasons for overruling the
2 considerations urged against its the rule's adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as
3 proposed and as adopted and the differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that

10 were not incorporated into the adopted rule.
11 (2) Rules may not unnecessarily repeat statutory language. Whenever it is necessary to refer to

1 and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.
2 (6) Whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt
3 rules to implement, interpret, make specific, or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, an adoption,
4 amendment, or repeal of a rule is not valid or effective unless it is:
5 (a) consistent and not in conflict with the statute; and
6 (b) reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. A statute mandating that the
7 agency adopt rules establishes the necessity for rules but does not, standing alone, constitute reasonable
8 necessity for a rule. The agency shall also address the reasonableness component of the reasonable necessity
9 requirement by, as indicated in 2-4-302(1) and subsection (1) of this section, stating the principal reasons and
10 the rationale for its intended action and for the particular approach that it takes in complying with the mandate
11 to adopt rules. Subject to the provisions of subsection (8), reasonable necessity must be clearly and thoroughly
12 demonstrated for each adoption, amendment, or repeal of a rule in the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking
13 and in the written and oral data, views, comments, or testimony submitted by the public or the agency and
14 considered by the agency. A statement that merely explains what the rule provides is not a statement of the
15 reasonable necessity for the rule.
16 (7) A rule is not valid unless notice of it is given and it is adopted in substantial compliance with 2-
17 4-302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section, unless notice of adoption of the rule is published within 6 months of
18 the publishing of notice of the proposed rule, and unless the adoption is in compliance with the prohibitions of
19 subsection (11) (10). The measure of whether an agency has adopted a rule in substantial compliance with 2-4-
20 302, 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section is not whether the agency has provided notice of the proposed rule,
21 standing alone, but rather must be based on an analysis of the agency's substantial compliance with 2-4-302,
22 2-4-303, or 2-4-306 and this section. If an amended or supplemental notice of either proposed or final
23 rulemaking, or both, is published concerning the same rule, the 6-month limit must be determined with
24 reference to the latest notice in all cases.
25 (8) (a) An agency may use an amended proposal notice or the adoption notice to correct
26 deficiencies in citations of authority for rules and in citations of sections implemented by rules.
27 (b) An agency may use an amended proposal notice but, except for clerical corrections, may not

1 use the adoption notice to correct deficiencies in a statement of reasonable necessity.
2 (c) If an agency uses an amended proposal notice to amend a statement of reasonable necessity
3 proposal for reasons other than for corrections in citations of authority, in citations of sections being
4 implemented, or of a clerical nature, the agency shall allow additional time for oral or written comments from the
5 same interested persons who were notified of the original proposal notice, including from a primary sponsor, if
6 primary sponsor notification was required under 2-4-302 [section 1], and from any other person who offered
7 comments or appeared at a hearing already held on the proposed rule.
8 (9) Subject to 2-4-112, if a majority of the members of the appropriate administrative rule review
9 committee notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to all or a portion of a notice of
10 proposed rulemaking, the committee shall notify the agency in writing that the committee objects to all or a
11 portion of the proposal notice and will address the objections at the next committee meeting. Following notice
12 by the committee to the agency, all or a portion of the proposal notice that the committee objects to may not be
13 adopted until publication of the last issue of the register that is published before expiration of the 6-month
14 period during which the adoption notice must be published, unless prior to that time, the committee meets and
15 does not make the same objection. A copy of the committee's notification to the agency must be included in the
16 committee's records.
17 (10)(9) This section applies to the department of labor and industry adopting a rule relating to a
18 commercial drug formulary as provided in 39-71-704. This section does not apply to the automatic updating of
19 department of labor and industry rules relating to commercial drug formularies as provided in 39-71-704.
20 (11)(10)(a) In the year preceding the year in which the legislature meets in regular session, an agency
21 may not adopt a rule between October 1 through the end of the year.
22 (b) This subsection (11)(10) does not apply to:
23 (i) an emergency rule adopted under 2-4-303;
24 (ii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(i) (10)(c)(i), a rule adopted for implementation of a program or
25 policy if the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice precluded adoption of the rule before October 1; or
26 (iii) subject to subsection (11)(c)(ii) (10)(c)(ii), a rule adopted by providing the proposal notice and
27 statement of reasoning with an opportunity to object to the appropriate administrative rule review committee.

1 (c) (i) A rule may only be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(ii) (10)(b)(ii) if the notice required
2 under 2-4-302(1)(a) provides a statement explaining why the unavailability of information, guidance, or notice
3 precluded adoption of the rule before October 1.
4 (ii) A rule may be exempted under subsection (11)(b)(iii) (10)(b)(iii) only if the agency provides a
5 copy of the proposal notice and an explanation of the reason why the rule must be adopted before the end of
6 the year by electronic mail to each member of the committee and the committee staff. If the committee does not
7 object to the proposal within 10 business days after the electronic mail of the proposal and explanation has
8 been sent to the committee, the agency may proceed with adoption of the proposed rule. If, during the 10-day
9 review period, a majority of the members notify the committee presiding officer that those members object to
10 the proposed rulemaking, the presiding officer shall notify the agency by electronic mail that the committee
11 objects. Following notice of the objection, a rule may not be adopted before the end of the year."
