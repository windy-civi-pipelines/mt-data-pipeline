15 willful or wanton misconduct.
16 (d) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any commissioner, member, officer,
17 executive director, employee, and agent of the commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment
18 obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the
19 scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for
20 believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the
21 actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that
22 person.

11 received by the commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.
12 (10) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
13 may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.
14 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed
15 rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
16 (a) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes are consistent
17 with the original purpose of the proposed rule.
18 (b) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to
19 the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
20 commenters.
21 (c) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
22 emergency as provided in Section 9(12), the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after
23 issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
24 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
25 emergency rule with 24 hours' notice, and with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking
26 procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
27 reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this
28 provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:

7 or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The
8 revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
9 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in
10 writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the

12 without the approval of the commission.

14 commission. The commission shall have no authority over any member state's rulemaking process or
15 procedural requirements that do not pertain to the compact.
16 (15) Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the commission, shall be construed to
17 limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other
18 rules related to the practice of respiratory therapy in that state, where those laws, regulations, or other rules are
19 not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact.

24 this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
25 (b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely
26 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
27 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
28 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 447
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 447.1
1 in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
2 (c) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
3 enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
4 purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
5 commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
6 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination are as follows:
7 (a) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
8 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written
9 notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
10 default, and any other action that the commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical
11 assistance regarding the default.
12 (b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
13 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
14 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners of the member states, and all rights,
15 privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of
16 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
17 the period of default.
18 (4) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of
19 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
20 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting
21 state's respiratory therapy licensing authority and each of the member states' respiratory therapy licensing
22 authorities.
23 (5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
24 incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
25 termination, if necessary.
26 (6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately
27 provide notice to all licensees and compact privilege holders (of which the commission has a record) within that
28 state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 447
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 447.1
1 compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of said notice of termination.
2 (7) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
3 has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
4 defaulting state.
5 (8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. district
6 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
7 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
8 (9) Dispute resolution is as follows:
9 (a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to
10 the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.
11 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
12 resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
13 (10) Enforcement is as follows:
14 (a) By majority vote, as may be further provided by rule, the commission may initiate legal action
15 against a member state in default in the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
16 where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
17 promulgated rules. A member state by enactment of this compact consents to venue and jurisdiction in such
18 court for the purposes set forth herein. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the
19 event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
20 including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
21 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member
22 state's law.
23 (b) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court for the
24 District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
25 with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
26 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
27 such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
28 (c) No person other than a member state shall enforce this compact against the commission.

13 (b) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member states
14 shall be subject to the process set forth herein and commission rule to determine if their enactments are

14 SECTION 12
15 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
16 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to
17 effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
18 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the commission's

20 (2) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
21 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
22 member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
23 to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
24 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
25 agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

27 in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Section 10, terminate a member state's participation

- 23 - Authorized Print Version – HB 447
****

3 as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
4 SECTION 13
5 CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
6 (1) Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that
7 is not inconsistent with the compact.

20 (a) increase public access to respiratory therapy services by creating a responsible, streamlined
21 pathway for licensees to practice in member states with the goal of improving outcomes for patients;
22 (b) enhance a state's ability to protect the public's health and safety;
23 (c) promote the cooperation of member states in regulating the practice of respiratory therapy
24 within those member states;
25 (d) ease administrative burdens on states by encouraging the cooperation of member states in
26 regulating multistate respiratory therapy practice;
27 (e) support relocating active military members and their spouses; and

11 determined by the commission that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for
12 believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that nothing
13 herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their own expense, and
14 provided further that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that person's intentional or
15 willful or wanton misconduct.
16 (d) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any commissioner, member, officer,
17 executive director, employee, and agent of the commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment
18 obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the
19 scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for
20 believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the
21 actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that
22 person.
23 (e) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a member state's
24 state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman Act,
25 the Clayton Act, or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or regulation.

7 (1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
8 implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force

25 (a) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;

11 received by the commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.
12 (10) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
13 may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.
14 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed
15 rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
16 (a) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes are consistent
17 with the original purpose of the proposed rule.
18 (b) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to
19 the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
20 commenters.
21 (c) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
22 emergency as provided in Section 9(12), the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after
23 issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
24 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
25 emergency rule with 24 hours' notice, and with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking
26 procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
27 reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this
28 provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:

6 previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency,
7 or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The
8 revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
9 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in
10 writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
11 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
12 without the approval of the commission.
13 (14) No member state's rulemaking process or procedural requirements shall apply to the
14 commission. The commission shall have no authority over any member state's rulemaking process or
15 procedural requirements that do not pertain to the compact.
16 (15) Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the commission, shall be construed to
17 limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other
18 rules related to the practice of respiratory therapy in that state, where those laws, regulations, or other rules are
19 not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact.

24 this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
25 (b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely
26 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
27 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
28 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 447

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 447.1
1 in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
2 (c) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
3 enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
4 purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
5 commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
6 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination are as follows:
7 (a) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
8 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written
9 notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
10 default, and any other action that the commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical
11 assistance regarding the default.
12 (b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
13 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
14 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners of the member states, and all rights,
15 privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of
16 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
17 the period of default.
18 (4) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of
19 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
20 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting
21 state's respiratory therapy licensing authority and each of the member states' respiratory therapy licensing
22 authorities.
23 (5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
24 incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
25 termination, if necessary.
26 (6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately
27 provide notice to all licensees and compact privilege holders (of which the commission has a record) within that
28 state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 447.1
1 compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of said notice of termination.
2 (7) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
3 has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
4 defaulting state.
5 (8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. district
6 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
7 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
8 (9) Dispute resolution is as follows:
9 (a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to
10 the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.
11 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
12 resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
13 (10) Enforcement is as follows:
14 (a) By majority vote, as may be further provided by rule, the commission may initiate legal action
15 against a member state in default in the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
16 where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
17 promulgated rules. A member state by enactment of this compact consents to venue and jurisdiction in such
18 court for the purposes set forth herein. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the
19 event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
20 including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
21 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member
22 state's law.
23 (b) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court for the
24 District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
25 with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
26 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
27 such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
28 (c) No person other than a member state shall enforce this compact against the commission.

4 law in the seventh member state ("effective date").
5 (a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the

9 compact shall be entitled to the default process set forth in Section 10.
10 (ii) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the

12 member states should be less than seven.
13 (b) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member states
14 shall be subject to the process set forth herein and commission rule to determine if their enactments are
15 materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
16 (c) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the
17 administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
18 existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the
19 commission. The commission shall own and have all rights to any intellectual property developed on behalf or
20 in furtherance of the commission by individuals or entities involved in organizing or establishing the
21 commission, as may be further set forth in rules of the commission.
22 (d) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission's initial adoption of the rules

2 therapy licensing authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this
3 compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

7 state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after
8 the date of such notice of withdrawal.
9 (3) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure
10 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
11 conflict with the provisions of this compact.
12 (4) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact shall
13 become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
14 SECTION 12
15 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
16 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to
17 effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
18 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the commission's
19 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
20 (2) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
21 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
22 member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
23 to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
24 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
25 agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
26 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the commission may deny a state's participation
27 in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Section 10, terminate a member state's participation
28 in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – HB 447

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 447.1
1 the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state,
2 the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect
3 as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
4 SECTION 13
5 CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
6 (1) Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that
7 is not inconsistent with the compact.
8 (2) Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict with
9 the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict, including any subsequently enacted state laws.
10 (3) All permissible agreements between the commission and the member states are binding in
11 accordance with their terms.
