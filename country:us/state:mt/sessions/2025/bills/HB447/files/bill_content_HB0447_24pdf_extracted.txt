2 for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused by or arising out of any actual or
3 alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a
4 reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities,

13 believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that nothing
14 herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their own expense, and

16 willful or wanton misconduct.
17 (d) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any commissioner, member, officer,
18 executive director, employee, and agent of the commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment
19 obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the
20 scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for
21 believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the
22 actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that
23 person.
24 (e) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a member state's
25 state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman Act,

8 (1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
9 implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force

12 received by the commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.
13 (10) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
14 may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.
15 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed
16 rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
17 (a) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes are consistent
18 with the original purpose of the proposed rule.
19 (b) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to
20 the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
21 commenters.
22 (c) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
23 emergency as provided in Section 9(12), the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after
24 issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
25 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
26 emergency rule with 24 hours' notice, and with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking
27 procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
28 reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0447.2
1 provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
2 (a) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
3 (b) prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;
4 (c) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or

8 or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The
9 revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
10 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in
11 writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
12 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
13 without the approval of the commission.
14 (14) No member state's rulemaking process or procedural requirements shall apply to the
15 commission. The commission shall have no authority over any member state's rulemaking process or
16 procedural requirements that do not pertain to the compact.
17 (15) Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the commission, shall be construed to
18 limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other
19 rules related to the practice of respiratory therapy in that state, where those laws, regulations, or other rules are
20 not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact.
21 SECTION 10
22 OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
23 (1) Oversight is as follows:
24 (a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce
25 this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
26 (b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely
27 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
28 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 447
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0447.2
1 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
2 in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
3 (c) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
4 enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
5 purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
6 commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
7 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination are as follows:
8 (a) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
9 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written
10 notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
11 default, and any other action that the commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical
12 assistance regarding the default.
13 (b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
14 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
15 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners of the member states, and all rights,
16 privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of
17 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
18 the period of default.
19 (4) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of
20 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
21 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting
22 state's respiratory therapy licensing authority and each of the member states' respiratory therapy licensing
23 authorities.
24 (5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
25 incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
26 termination, if necessary.
27 (6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately
28 provide notice to all licensees and compact privilege holders (of which the commission has a record) within that
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 447
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0447.2
1 state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this
2 compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of said notice of termination.
3 (7) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
4 has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
5 defaulting state.
6 (8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. district
7 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
8 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
9 (9) Dispute resolution is as follows:
10 (a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to
11 the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.
12 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
13 resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
14 (10) Enforcement is as follows:
15 (a) By majority vote, as may be further provided by rule, the commission may initiate legal action
16 against a member state in default in the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
17 where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
18 promulgated rules. A member state by enactment of this compact consents to venue and jurisdiction in such
19 court for the purposes set forth herein. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the
20 event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
21 including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
22 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member
23 state's law.
24 (b) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court for the
25 District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
26 with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
27 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
28 such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – HB 447
- 2025

8 enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact.
9 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
10 compact shall be entitled to the default process set forth in Section 10.

12 compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of
13 member states should be less than seven.
14 (b) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member states
15 shall be subject to the process set forth herein and commission rule to determine if their enactments are

21 in furtherance of the commission by individuals or entities involved in organizing or establishing the
22 commission, as may be further set forth in rules of the commission.
23 (d) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commission's initial adoption of the rules

5 (c) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately
6 provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees and compact privilege holders (of which the commission has a
7 record) within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing
8 state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after
9 the date of such notice of withdrawal.
10 (3) Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure
11 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
12 conflict with the provisions of this compact.
13 (4) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact shall
14 become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
15 SECTION 12
16 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
17 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to
18 effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
19 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the commission's
20 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
21 (2) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
22 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
23 member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
24 to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
25 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
26 agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
27 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, the commission may deny a state's participation
28 in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Section 10, terminate a member state's participation
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – HB 447
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0447.2
1 in the compact if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from
2 the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state,
3 the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect
4 as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
5 SECTION 13

19 obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the
20 scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for
21 believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the
22 actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that
23 person.
24 (e) Nothing in this compact shall be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a member state's
25 state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman Act,

8 (1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
9 implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule shall be invalid and have no force

12 received by the commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public.
13 (10) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
14 may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.
15 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed
16 rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
17 (a) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes are consistent
18 with the original purpose of the proposed rule.
19 (b) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to
20 the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
21 commenters.
22 (c) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
23 emergency as provided in Section 9(12), the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after
24 issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
25 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
26 emergency rule with 24 hours' notice, and with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking
27 procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
28 reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this

1 provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
2 (a) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;

8 or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The
9 revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be

11 writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
12 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
13 without the approval of the commission.
14 (14) No member state's rulemaking process or procedural requirements shall apply to the
15 commission. The commission shall have no authority over any member state's rulemaking process or
16 procedural requirements that do not pertain to the compact.
17 (15) Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the commission, shall be construed to
18 limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other
19 rules related to the practice of respiratory therapy in that state, where those laws, regulations, or other rules are
20 not inconsistent with the provisions of this compact.

24 (a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce
25 this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
26 (b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely
27 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
28 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – HB 447

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0447.2
1 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
2 in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
3 (c) The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
4 enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
5 purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
6 commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
7 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination are as follows:
8 (a) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
9 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written
10 notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
11 default, and any other action that the commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical
12 assistance regarding the default.
13 (b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
14 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
15 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners of the member states, and all rights,
16 privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of
17 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during
18 the period of default.
19 (4) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of
20 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the
21 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting
22 state's respiratory therapy licensing authority and each of the member states' respiratory therapy licensing
23 authorities.
24 (5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
25 incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
26 termination, if necessary.
27 (6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately
28 provide notice to all licensees and compact privilege holders (of which the commission has a record) within that
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 447

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0447.2
1 state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this
2 compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of said notice of termination.
3 (7) The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
4 has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
5 defaulting state.
6 (8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. district
7 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
8 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
9 (9) Dispute resolution is as follows:
10 (a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to
11 the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.
12 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
13 resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
14 (10) Enforcement is as follows:
15 (a) By majority vote, as may be further provided by rule, the commission may initiate legal action
16 against a member state in default in the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
17 where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
18 promulgated rules. A member state by enactment of this compact consents to venue and jurisdiction in such
19 court for the purposes set forth herein. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the
20 event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
21 including reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the
22 commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member
23 state's law.
24 (b) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court for the
25 District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
26 with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
27 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
28 such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.

8 state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after
9 the date of such notice of withdrawal.

11 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
12 conflict with the provisions of this compact.

15 SECTION 12
16 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
17 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to
18 effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
19 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the commission's
20 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
21 (2) The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
22 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
23 member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
24 to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent

28 in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of Section 10, terminate a member state's participation

2 the compact. Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state,
3 the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect
4 as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
