Section 3:
Section 2. Section 75-5-301, MCA, is amended to read:
"75-5-301. Classification and standards for state waters. Consistent with the provisions of 80-15-
201 and this chapter, the department shall:
(1) establish the classification of all state waters in accordance with their present and future most
beneficial uses, creating an appropriate classification for streams that, due to sporadic flow, do not support an
aquatic ecosystem that includes salmonid or nonsalmonid fish;
(2) formulate and adopt standards of water quality, considering the economics of waste treatment
and prevention. When rules are adopted regarding temporary standards, they must conform with the
requirements of 75-5-312. Standards must meet the following requirements:
(a) for carcinogens, the water quality standard for protection of human health must be the value
associated with an excess lifetime cancer risk level, assuming continuous lifetime exposure, not to exceed 1 x
10 -3 in the case of arsenic and 1 x 10 -5 for other carcinogens. However, if a standard established at a risk
level of 1 x 10 -3 for arsenic or 1 x 10 -5 for other carcinogens violates the maximum contaminant level
obtained from 40 CFR, part 141, then the maximum contaminant level must be adopted as the standard for that
carcinogen.
(b) standards for the protection of aquatic life do not apply to ground water.
(3) review, from time to time at intervals of not more than 3 years and, to the extent permitted by
this chapter, revise established classifications of waters and adopted standards of water quality;
(4) adopt rules governing the granting of mixing zones, requiring that mixing zones granted by the
department be specifically identified and requiring that mixing zones have:
(a) the smallest practicable size;
(b) a minimum practicable effect on water uses; and
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – HB 685

69th Legislature 2025 HB 685
(c) definable boundaries;
(5) adopt rules implementing the nondegradation policy established in 75-5-303, including but not
limited to rules that:
(a) provide a procedure for department review and authorization of degradation a feasibility
allowance;
(b) establish criteria for the following:
(i) determining important economic or social development; and
(ii) weighing the social and economic importance to the public of allowing the proposed project
against the cost to society associated with a loss of water quality;
(c) establish criteria for determining whether a proposed activity or class of activities, in addition to
those activities identified in 75-5-317, will result in nonsignificant changes in water quality for any parameter in
order that those activities are not required to undergo review under 75-5-303(3). These criteria must be
established in a manner that generally:
(i) equates significance with the potential for harm to human health, a beneficial use, or the
environment;
(ii) considers both the quantity and the strength of the pollutant;
(iii) considers the length of time the degradation will occur;
(iv) considers the character of the pollutant so that greater significance is associated with
carcinogens and toxins that bioaccumulate or biomagnify and lesser significance is associated with substances
that are less harmful or less persistent.
(d) provide that changes of nitrate as nitrogen in ground water are nonsignificant if the discharge
will not cause degradation of surface water and the predicted concentration of nitrate as nitrogen at the
boundary of the ground water mixing zone does not exceed:
(i) 7.5 milligrams per liter from sources other than sewage;
(ii) 5.0 milligrams per liter from sewage discharged from a system that does not use level two
treatment in an area where the ground water nitrate as nitrogen is 5.0 milligrams per liter or less;
(iii) 7.5 milligrams per liter from sewage discharged from a system using level two treatment, which
must be defined in the rules; or
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – HB 685

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 685
(iv) 7.5 milligrams per liter from sewage discharged from a system in areas where the ground water
nitrate as nitrogen level exceeds 5.0 milligrams per liter primarily from sources other than human waste; and
(e) for septic system discharges that are not subject to ground water permitting requirements
under 75-5-401, establish criteria to determine when the discharges result in nonsignificant changes in surface
water quality in order that those discharges are not required to undergo review under 75-5-303(3) and no
further analysis under law or rule is required. The criteria must:
(i) be adopted by rule before July 1, 2024; and
(ii) be developed in a manner that generally considers soil type, mixing zone dilution and nitrogen
credits, horizontal distance between the discharge and the surface water in the direction of ground water flow,
and elevation, including:
(A) adopt surface water impacts for low flow conditions based on mixing zone dilution
concentrations and other credits for nitrogen;
(B) credit nitrogen degradation at the drainfield and riparian zone attenuation based on soil type;
(C) exempt surface water body impacts when drainfield is lower in elevation than the waterbody;
(D) limit the adjacent to surface water trigger analysis to a maximum of 1/4 or 1/2 mile from the
drainfield to a surface water, depending on soil type; and
(E) create nonsignificant surface water impact categories of 500 or more feet from the surface
water that consider soil texture, ground water depths and other pertinent information.
(6) to the extent practicable, ensure that the rules adopted under subsection (5) establish objective
and quantifiable criteria for various parameters. These criteria must, to the extent practicable, constitute
guidelines for granting or denying applications for authorization to degrade high-quality waters under the policy
established in 75-5-303(2) and (3).
(7) adopt rules to implement this section."

Section 4:
Section 3. Section 75-5-303, MCA, is amended to read:

(3) The department may not authorize degradation of allow lower water quality through a feasibility
allowance in high-quality waters unless when it has been affirmatively demonstrated by a preponderance of
evidence to the department that:
(a) degradation a feasibility allowance is necessary because there are no economically,
environmentally, and technologically feasible modifications to the proposed project that would result in no
degradation;
(b) the proposed project will result in important economic or social development and that the
benefit of the development exceeds the costs to society of allowing degradation of in the area that the high-
quality waters are located;
(c) existing and anticipated use of state waters will be fully protected; and
(d) the least degrading water quality protection practices determined by the department to be
economically, environmentally, and technologically feasible will be fully implemented by the applicant prior to

procedure -- definition. (1) As provided under the provisions of 75-5-301 and this section, the department may
adopt rules regarding the classification of waters as outstanding resource waters.
(2) The department may not:
(a) grant an authorization to degrade a feasibility allowance under 75-5-303 in outstanding
resource waters; or
(b) allow a new or increased point source discharge that would result in a permanent change in the
water quality of an outstanding resource water.
(3) (a) A person may petition the department for rulemaking to classify state waters as outstanding
resource waters. The department shall initially review a petition against the criteria identified in subsection (3)(c)
to determine whether the petition contains sufficient credible information for the department to accept the
petition.
(b) The department may reject a petition without further review if it determines that the petition
does not contain the sufficient credible information required by subsection (3)(a). If the department rejects a
petition under this subsection (3)(b), it shall specify in writing the reasons for the rejection and the petition's
deficiencies.
(c) The department may not adopt a rule classifying state waters as outstanding resource waters
until it accepts a petition and makes a written finding containing the provisions enumerated in subsection (3)(d)

- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 685
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 685
provided in subsection (4);
(ii) the increased protection under the classification is necessary to protect the outstanding
resource identified under subsection (3)(a) because of a finding that the outstanding resource is at risk of
having one or more of the criteria provided in subsection (4) compromised as a result of pollution; and
(iii) classification as an outstanding resource water is necessary because of a finding that there is
no other effective process available that will achieve the necessary protection.

Section 2. Section 75-5-301, MCA, is amended to read:
"75-5-301. Classification and standards for state waters. Consistent with the provisions of 80-15-
201 and this chapter, the department shall:
(1) establish the classification of all state waters in accordance with their present and future most
beneficial uses, creating an appropriate classification for streams that, due to sporadic flow, do not support an
aquatic ecosystem that includes salmonid or nonsalmonid fish;
(2) formulate and adopt standards of water quality, considering the economics of waste treatment
and prevention. When rules are adopted regarding temporary standards, they must conform with the
requirements of 75-5-312. Standards must meet the following requirements:
(a) for carcinogens, the water quality standard for protection of human health must be the value
associated with an excess lifetime cancer risk level, assuming continuous lifetime exposure, not to exceed 1 x
10 -3 in the case of arsenic and 1 x 10 -5 for other carcinogens. However, if a standard established at a risk
level of 1 x 10 -3 for arsenic or 1 x 10 -5 for other carcinogens violates the maximum contaminant level
obtained from 40 CFR, part 141, then the maximum contaminant level must be adopted as the standard for that
carcinogen.
(b) standards for the protection of aquatic life do not apply to ground water.
(3) review, from time to time at intervals of not more than 3 years and, to the extent permitted by
this chapter, revise established classifications of waters and adopted standards of water quality;

(c) definable boundaries;
(5) adopt rules implementing the nondegradation policy established in 75-5-303, including but not
limited to rules that:
(a) provide a procedure for department review and authorization of degradation a feasibility
allowance;
(b) establish criteria for the following:
(i) determining important economic or social development; and
(ii) weighing the social and economic importance to the public of allowing the proposed project
against the cost to society associated with a loss of water quality;
(c) establish criteria for determining whether a proposed activity or class of activities, in addition to
those activities identified in 75-5-317, will result in nonsignificant changes in water quality for any parameter in
order that those activities are not required to undergo review under 75-5-303(3). These criteria must be
established in a manner that generally:
(i) equates significance with the potential for harm to human health, a beneficial use, or the
environment;
(ii) considers both the quantity and the strength of the pollutant;
(iii) considers the length of time the degradation will occur;
(iv) considers the character of the pollutant so that greater significance is associated with
carcinogens and toxins that bioaccumulate or biomagnify and lesser significance is associated with substances
that are less harmful or less persistent.
(d) provide that changes of nitrate as nitrogen in ground water are nonsignificant if the discharge
will not cause degradation of surface water and the predicted concentration of nitrate as nitrogen at the
boundary of the ground water mixing zone does not exceed:
(i) 7.5 milligrams per liter from sources other than sewage;
(ii) 5.0 milligrams per liter from sewage discharged from a system that does not use level two
treatment in an area where the ground water nitrate as nitrogen is 5.0 milligrams per liter or less;

nitrate as nitrogen level exceeds 5.0 milligrams per liter primarily from sources other than human waste; and
(e) for septic system discharges that are not subject to ground water permitting requirements
under 75-5-401, establish criteria to determine when the discharges result in nonsignificant changes in surface
water quality in order that those discharges are not required to undergo review under 75-5-303(3) and no
further analysis under law or rule is required. The criteria must:
(i) be adopted by rule before July 1, 2024; and
(ii) be developed in a manner that generally considers soil type, mixing zone dilution and nitrogen
credits, horizontal distance between the discharge and the surface water in the direction of ground water flow,
and elevation, including:
(A) adopt surface water impacts for low flow conditions based on mixing zone dilution
concentrations and other credits for nitrogen;
(B) credit nitrogen degradation at the drainfield and riparian zone attenuation based on soil type;
(C) exempt surface water body impacts when drainfield is lower in elevation than the waterbody;
(D) limit the adjacent to surface water trigger analysis to a maximum of 1/4 or 1/2 mile from the
drainfield to a surface water, depending on soil type; and
(E) create nonsignificant surface water impact categories of 500 or more feet from the surface
water that consider soil texture, ground water depths and other pertinent information.
(6) to the extent practicable, ensure that the rules adopted under subsection (5) establish objective
and quantifiable criteria for various parameters. These criteria must, to the extent practicable, constitute
guidelines for granting or denying applications for authorization to degrade high-quality waters under the policy
established in 75-5-303(2) and (3).
