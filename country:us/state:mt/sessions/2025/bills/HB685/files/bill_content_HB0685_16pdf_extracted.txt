6 Section 2. Section 75-5-301, MCA, is amended to read:
7 "75-5-301. Classification and standards for state waters. Consistent with the provisions of 80-15-
8 201 and this chapter, the department shall:
9 (1) establish the classification of all state waters in accordance with their present and future most
10 beneficial uses, creating an appropriate classification for streams that, due to sporadic flow, do not support an
11 aquatic ecosystem that includes salmonid or nonsalmonid fish;
12 (2) formulate and adopt standards of water quality, considering the economics of waste treatment
13 and prevention. When rules are adopted regarding temporary standards, they must conform with the
14 requirements of 75-5-312. Standards must meet the following requirements:
15 (a) for carcinogens, the water quality standard for protection of human health must be the value
16 associated with an excess lifetime cancer risk level, assuming continuous lifetime exposure, not to exceed 1 x
17 10 -3 in the case of arsenic and 1 x 10 -5 for other carcinogens. However, if a standard established at a risk
18 level of 1 x 10 -3 for arsenic or 1 x 10 -5 for other carcinogens violates the maximum contaminant level
19 obtained from 40 CFR, part 141, then the maximum contaminant level must be adopted as the standard for that
20 carcinogen.
21 (b) standards for the protection of aquatic life do not apply to ground water.
22 (3) review, from time to time at intervals of not more than 3 years and, to the extent permitted by
23 this chapter, revise established classifications of waters and adopted standards of water quality;
24 (4) adopt rules governing the granting of mixing zones, requiring that mixing zones granted by the
25 department be specifically identified and requiring that mixing zones have:
26 (a) the smallest practicable size;
27 (b) a minimum practicable effect on water uses; and
28 (c) definable boundaries;
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – HB 685
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 685.1
1 (5) adopt rules implementing the nondegradation policy established in 75-5-303, including but not
2 limited to rules that:
3 (a) provide a procedure for department review and authorization of degradation a feasibility
4 allowance;
5 (b) establish criteria for the following:
6 (i) determining important economic or social development; and
7 (ii) weighing the social and economic importance to the public of allowing the proposed project
8 against the cost to society associated with a loss of water quality;
9 (c) establish criteria for determining whether a proposed activity or class of activities, in addition to
10 those activities identified in 75-5-317, will result in nonsignificant changes in water quality for any parameter in
11 order that those activities are not required to undergo review under 75-5-303(3). These criteria must be
12 established in a manner that generally:
13 (i) equates significance with the potential for harm to human health, a beneficial use, or the
14 environment;
15 (ii) considers both the quantity and the strength of the pollutant;
16 (iii) considers the length of time the degradation will occur;
17 (iv) considers the character of the pollutant so that greater significance is associated with
18 carcinogens and toxins that bioaccumulate or biomagnify and lesser significance is associated with substances
19 that are less harmful or less persistent.
20 (d) provide that changes of nitrate as nitrogen in ground water are nonsignificant if the discharge
21 will not cause degradation of surface water and the predicted concentration of nitrate as nitrogen at the
22 boundary of the ground water mixing zone does not exceed:

1 nitrate as nitrogen level exceeds 5.0 milligrams per liter primarily from sources other than human waste; and
2 (e) for septic system discharges that are not subject to ground water permitting requirements
3 under 75-5-401, establish criteria to determine when the discharges result in nonsignificant changes in surface
4 water quality in order that those discharges are not required to undergo review under 75-5-303(3) and no
5 further analysis under law or rule is required. The criteria must:
6 (i) be adopted by rule before July 1, 2024; and
7 (ii) be developed in a manner that generally considers soil type, mixing zone dilution and nitrogen
8 credits, horizontal distance between the discharge and the surface water in the direction of ground water flow,
9 and elevation, including:
10 (A) adopt surface water impacts for low flow conditions based on mixing zone dilution
11 concentrations and other credits for nitrogen;
12 (B) credit nitrogen degradation at the drainfield and riparian zone attenuation based on soil type;
13 (C) exempt surface water body impacts when drainfield is lower in elevation than the waterbody;
14 (D) limit the adjacent to surface water trigger analysis to a maximum of 1/4 or 1/2 mile from the
15 drainfield to a surface water, depending on soil type; and
16 (E) create nonsignificant surface water impact categories of 500 or more feet from the surface
17 water that consider soil texture, ground water depths and other pertinent information.
18 (6) to the extent practicable, ensure that the rules adopted under subsection (5) establish objective
19 and quantifiable criteria for various parameters. These criteria must, to the extent practicable, constitute
20 guidelines for granting or denying applications for authorization to degrade high-quality waters under the policy
21 established in 75-5-303(2) and (3).

1 (3) The department may not authorize degradation of allow lower water quality through a feasibility
2 allowance in high-quality waters unless when it has been affirmatively demonstrated by a preponderance of
3 evidence to the department that:
4 (a) degradation a feasibility allowance is necessary because there are no economically,
5 environmentally, and technologically feasible modifications to the proposed project that would result in no
6 degradation;
7 (b) the proposed project will result in important economic or social development and that the
8 benefit of the development exceeds the costs to society of allowing degradation of in the area that the high-
9 quality waters are located;
10 (c) existing and anticipated use of state waters will be fully protected; and
11 (d) the least degrading water quality protection practices determined by the department to be
12 economically, environmentally, and technologically feasible will be fully implemented by the applicant prior to
13 and during the proposed activity.
14 (4) The department shall issue a preliminary decision either denying or authorizing degradation the
15 feasibility allowance and shall provide public notice and a 30-day comment period prior to issuing a final
16 decision. The department's preliminary and final decisions must include:
17 (a) a statement of the basis for the decision; and
18 (b) a detailed description of all conditions applied to any authorization to degrade state waters a
19 feasibility allowance, including, when applicable, monitoring requirements, required water protection practices,
20 reporting requirements, effluent limits, designation of the mixing zones, the limits of degradation the authorized
21 feasibility allowance, and methods of determining compliance with the authorization for degradation feasibility
22 allowance.
23 (5) An interested person wishing to challenge a final department decision may request a hearing
24 before the board within 30 days of the final department decision. The contested case procedures of Title 2,
25 chapter 4, part 6, apply to a hearing under this section.
26 (6) Periodically, but not more often than every 5 years, the department may review authorizations
27 to degrade feasibility allowances for state waters. Following the review, the department may, after timely notice
28 and opportunity for hearing, modify the authorization feasibility allowance if the department determines that an

7 Section 4. Section 75-5-316, MCA, is amended to read:
8 "75-5-316. Outstanding resource water classification -- rules -- criteria -- limitations --
9 procedure -- definition. (1) As provided under the provisions of 75-5-301 and this section, the department may
10 adopt rules regarding the classification of waters as outstanding resource waters.
11 (2) The department may not:
12 (a) grant an authorization to degrade a feasibility allowance under 75-5-303 in outstanding
13 resource waters; or
14 (b) allow a new or increased point source discharge that would result in a permanent change in the
15 water quality of an outstanding resource water.
16 (3) (a) A person may petition the department for rulemaking to classify state waters as outstanding
17 resource waters. The department shall initially review a petition against the criteria identified in subsection (3)(c)
18 to determine whether the petition contains sufficient credible information for the department to accept the
19 petition.
20 (b) The department may reject a petition without further review if it determines that the petition
21 does not contain the sufficient credible information required by subsection (3)(a). If the department rejects a
22 petition under this subsection (3)(b), it shall specify in writing the reasons for the rejection and the petition's
23 deficiencies.
24 (c) The department may not adopt a rule classifying state waters as outstanding resource waters
25 until it accepts a petition and makes a written finding containing the provisions enumerated in subsection (3)(d)
26 that, based on a preponderance of the evidence:
27 (i) the waters identified in the petition constitute an outstanding resource based on the criteria
28 provided in subsection (4);
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 685
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 685.1
1 (ii) the increased protection under the classification is necessary to protect the outstanding
2 resource identified under subsection (3)(a) because of a finding that the outstanding resource is at risk of
3 having one or more of the criteria provided in subsection (4) compromised as a result of pollution; and
4 (iii) classification as an outstanding resource water is necessary because of a finding that there is
5 no other effective process available that will achieve the necessary protection.
6 (d) The written finding provided for in subsection (3)(c) must:
7 (i) identify the criteria provided in subsection (4) that serve as justification for the determination
8 that the water is an outstanding resource;
9 (ii) specifically identify the criteria that are at risk and explain why those criteria are at risk; and
10 (iii) specifically explain why other available processes, including the requirements of 75-5-303, will
11 not achieve the necessary protection.
12 (4) The department shall consider the following criteria in determining whether certain state waters
13 are outstanding resource waters. However, the department may determine that compliance with one or more of
14 these criteria is insufficient to warrant classification of the water as an outstanding resource water. The
15 department shall consider:
16 (a) whether the waters have been designated as wild and scenic;
17 (b) the presence of endangered or threatened species in the waters;
18 (c) the presence of an outstanding recreational fishery in the waters;
19 (d) whether the waters provide the only source of suitable water for a municipality or industry;
20 (e) whether the waters provide the only source of suitable water for domestic water supply; and

7 "75-5-301. Classification and standards for state waters. Consistent with the provisions of 80-15-
8 201 and this chapter, the department shall:
9 (1) establish the classification of all state waters in accordance with their present and future most
10 beneficial uses, creating an appropriate classification for streams that, due to sporadic flow, do not support an
11 aquatic ecosystem that includes salmonid or nonsalmonid fish;
12 (2) formulate and adopt standards of water quality, considering the economics of waste treatment
13 and prevention. When rules are adopted regarding temporary standards, they must conform with the
14 requirements of 75-5-312. Standards must meet the following requirements:
15 (a) for carcinogens, the water quality standard for protection of human health must be the value
16 associated with an excess lifetime cancer risk level, assuming continuous lifetime exposure, not to exceed 1 x
17 10 -3 in the case of arsenic and 1 x 10 -5 for other carcinogens. However, if a standard established at a risk
18 level of 1 x 10 -3 for arsenic or 1 x 10 -5 for other carcinogens violates the maximum contaminant level
19 obtained from 40 CFR, part 141, then the maximum contaminant level must be adopted as the standard for that
20 carcinogen.
21 (b) standards for the protection of aquatic life do not apply to ground water.
22 (3) review, from time to time at intervals of not more than 3 years and, to the extent permitted by
23 this chapter, revise established classifications of waters and adopted standards of water quality;
24 (4) adopt rules governing the granting of mixing zones, requiring that mixing zones granted by the
25 department be specifically identified and requiring that mixing zones have:
26 (a) the smallest practicable size;
27 (b) a minimum practicable effect on water uses; and
28 (c) definable boundaries;

3 (a) provide a procedure for department review and authorization of degradation a feasibility
4 allowance;
5 (b) establish criteria for the following:
6 (i) determining important economic or social development; and
7 (ii) weighing the social and economic importance to the public of allowing the proposed project
8 against the cost to society associated with a loss of water quality;
9 (c) establish criteria for determining whether a proposed activity or class of activities, in addition to
10 those activities identified in 75-5-317, will result in nonsignificant changes in water quality for any parameter in
11 order that those activities are not required to undergo review under 75-5-303(3). These criteria must be
12 established in a manner that generally:
13 (i) equates significance with the potential for harm to human health, a beneficial use, or the
14 environment;
15 (ii) considers both the quantity and the strength of the pollutant;
16 (iii) considers the length of time the degradation will occur;
17 (iv) considers the character of the pollutant so that greater significance is associated with
18 carcinogens and toxins that bioaccumulate or biomagnify and lesser significance is associated with substances
19 that are less harmful or less persistent.
20 (d) provide that changes of nitrate as nitrogen in ground water are nonsignificant if the discharge
21 will not cause degradation of surface water and the predicted concentration of nitrate as nitrogen at the
22 boundary of the ground water mixing zone does not exceed:
23 (i) 7.5 milligrams per liter from sources other than sewage;
24 (ii) 5.0 milligrams per liter from sewage discharged from a system that does not use level two
25 treatment in an area where the ground water nitrate as nitrogen is 5.0 milligrams per liter or less;
26 (iii) 7.5 milligrams per liter from sewage discharged from a system using level two treatment, which
27 must be defined in the rules; or
28 (iv) 7.5 milligrams per liter from sewage discharged from a system in areas where the ground water

1 nitrate as nitrogen level exceeds 5.0 milligrams per liter primarily from sources other than human waste; and
2 (e) for septic system discharges that are not subject to ground water permitting requirements
3 under 75-5-401, establish criteria to determine when the discharges result in nonsignificant changes in surface
4 water quality in order that those discharges are not required to undergo review under 75-5-303(3) and no
5 further analysis under law or rule is required. The criteria must:
6 (i) be adopted by rule before July 1, 2024; and
7 (ii) be developed in a manner that generally considers soil type, mixing zone dilution and nitrogen
8 credits, horizontal distance between the discharge and the surface water in the direction of ground water flow,
9 and elevation, including:
10 (A) adopt surface water impacts for low flow conditions based on mixing zone dilution
11 concentrations and other credits for nitrogen;
12 (B) credit nitrogen degradation at the drainfield and riparian zone attenuation based on soil type;
13 (C) exempt surface water body impacts when drainfield is lower in elevation than the waterbody;
14 (D) limit the adjacent to surface water trigger analysis to a maximum of 1/4 or 1/2 mile from the
15 drainfield to a surface water, depending on soil type; and
16 (E) create nonsignificant surface water impact categories of 500 or more feet from the surface
17 water that consider soil texture, ground water depths and other pertinent information.
18 (6) to the extent practicable, ensure that the rules adopted under subsection (5) establish objective
19 and quantifiable criteria for various parameters. These criteria must, to the extent practicable, constitute
20 guidelines for granting or denying applications for authorization to degrade high-quality waters under the policy
21 established in 75-5-303(2) and (3).

1 (3) The department may not authorize degradation of allow lower water quality through a feasibility
2 allowance in high-quality waters unless when it has been affirmatively demonstrated by a preponderance of
3 evidence to the department that:
4 (a) degradation a feasibility allowance is necessary because there are no economically,
5 environmentally, and technologically feasible modifications to the proposed project that would result in no
6 degradation;
7 (b) the proposed project will result in important economic or social development and that the
8 benefit of the development exceeds the costs to society of allowing degradation of in the area that the high-
9 quality waters are located;
10 (c) existing and anticipated use of state waters will be fully protected; and

11 (2) The department may not:
12 (a) grant an authorization to degrade a feasibility allowance under 75-5-303 in outstanding
13 resource waters; or
14 (b) allow a new or increased point source discharge that would result in a permanent change in the
15 water quality of an outstanding resource water.
16 (3) (a) A person may petition the department for rulemaking to classify state waters as outstanding
17 resource waters. The department shall initially review a petition against the criteria identified in subsection (3)(c)
18 to determine whether the petition contains sufficient credible information for the department to accept the
19 petition.
20 (b) The department may reject a petition without further review if it determines that the petition
21 does not contain the sufficient credible information required by subsection (3)(a). If the department rejects a
22 petition under this subsection (3)(b), it shall specify in writing the reasons for the rejection and the petition's
23 deficiencies.
24 (c) The department may not adopt a rule classifying state waters as outstanding resource waters
25 until it accepts a petition and makes a written finding containing the provisions enumerated in subsection (3)(d)
26 that, based on a preponderance of the evidence:
27 (i) the waters identified in the petition constitute an outstanding resource based on the criteria
28 provided in subsection (4);
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 685

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 685.1
1 (ii) the increased protection under the classification is necessary to protect the outstanding
2 resource identified under subsection (3)(a) because of a finding that the outstanding resource is at risk of
3 having one or more of the criteria provided in subsection (4) compromised as a result of pollution; and
4 (iii) classification as an outstanding resource water is necessary because of a finding that there is
5 no other effective process available that will achieve the necessary protection.
6 (d) The written finding provided for in subsection (3)(c) must:
7 (i) identify the criteria provided in subsection (4) that serve as justification for the determination
8 that the water is an outstanding resource;
9 (ii) specifically identify the criteria that are at risk and explain why those criteria are at risk; and
10 (iii) specifically explain why other available processes, including the requirements of 75-5-303, will
11 not achieve the necessary protection.
12 (4) The department shall consider the following criteria in determining whether certain state waters
13 are outstanding resource waters. However, the department may determine that compliance with one or more of
14 these criteria is insufficient to warrant classification of the water as an outstanding resource water. The
15 department shall consider:
16 (a) whether the waters have been designated as wild and scenic;
17 (b) the presence of endangered or threatened species in the waters;
18 (c) the presence of an outstanding recreational fishery in the waters;
19 (d) whether the waters provide the only source of suitable water for a municipality or industry;
20 (e) whether the waters provide the only source of suitable water for domestic water supply; and
21 (f) other factors that indicate outstanding environmental or economic values not specifically
22 mentioned in this subsection (4).
