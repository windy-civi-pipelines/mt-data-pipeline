1
2 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Definitions. As used in [sections 1 through 5], the following definitions
3 apply:
4 (1) (a) "Dental insurer" means an insurance company licensed to do business in the state that
5 offers coverage for dental services, including excepted benefits as defined in 33-22-140.
6 (b) The term does not include health insurance coverage described in [section 1(4)].
7 (2) "Dental loss ratio" means the percentage of premium dollars spent on patient care as
8 calculated pursuant to subsection (3)(b)(i).
9 (3) (a) "Medical loss ratio" is the minimum percentage of all premium funds collected by an insurer
10 each year that must be spent on actual patient care rather than overhead costs. This minimum required
11 percentage that dental insurance plans must meet for the portion of patient premiums must be dedicated to
12 patient care rather than administrative and overhead costs or the difference must be refunded in the form of a
13 rebate.
14 (b) The dental loss ratio is calculated by dividing the numerator by the denominator, in which:
15 (i) the numerator is the sum of the amount incurred for clinical dental services provided to
16 enrollees, the amount incurred on activities that improve dental care quality, and other incurred claims as
17 defined in 45 CFR 158.140(a); and
18 (ii) the denominator is the total amount of premium revenue, excluding federal and state taxes,
19 licensing and regulatory fees paid, nonprofit community benefit expenditures as defined in 45 CFR 158.162(c),
20 and any other payments required by federal law.
21
22 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Transparency of dental insurance premiums. (1) A dental insurer that
23 issues, sells, or renews a plan, policy, contract, or certificate covering dental services shall file by March 1 of
24 each year with its annual statement a medical dental loss ratio report with the commissioner of securities and
25 insurance that is organized by market and product type and contains similar information required in the 2013
26 federal medical loss ratio annual reporting form. The filing must also report additional data that includes the
27 number of enrollees, the plan cost-sharing and deductible amounts, the annual maximum coverage limit, and

1 the number of enrollees who meet or exceed the annual coverage limit.
2 (2) (a) The dental loss ratio reporting year must be for the policy year during which dental
3 coverage is provided by the insurer. All terms used in the dental loss ratio annual report have the same
4 meaning as used in the federal Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 300gg-18, and 45 CFR, part 158.
5 (b) If data verification of the dental insurer's representations in the dental loss ratio annual report is
6 considered necessary, the commissioner shall provide the dental insurer with a notification of the additional
7 information needed within 30 days.
8 (c) The dental insurer has 30 days from the date of notification to submit to the commissioner all
9 requested data. The commissioner may extend the time for a dental insurer to comply with this subsection
10 (2)(c) on a finding of good cause.
11 (3) By January 1 of the year after the commissioner receives the dental loss ratio information
12 collected pursuant to [sections 1 through 5], the commissioner shall make the information, including the
13 aggregate dental loss ratio and other data reported pursuant to this section, available to the public in a
14 searchable format on a public website that allows members of the public to compare dental loss ratios among
15 insurers by plan type. The commissioner shall accomplish this by:
16 (a) posting the information on the department's website; and
17 (b) requiring the insurer to publish their specific information on the dental insurer's website.
18 (4) The commissioner shall report biennially the data in this section to the economic affairs interim
19 committee in accordance with 5-11-210.
20
21 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Excess revenue -- rebate to policyholders and certificate holders.
22 (1) (a) (i) A dental insurer that issues, sells, or renews a plan, policy, contract, or certificate covering dental
23 services shall provide an annual rebate or credit to each policyholder or certificate holder:
24 (A) whether individual or part of a group;
25 (B) on a pro rata basis; and
26 (C) if the ratio of the amount of premium revenue expended by the dental insurer on the costs for
27 reimbursement for services provided to policyholders or certificate holders to the total amount of premium

1 revenue, as reported in [section 3], is less than 80%.
2 (ii) The cost of activities that improve dental care quality may be added to the costs for
3 reimbursement in the calculation.
4 (b) The total amount of premium revenue must exclude federal and state taxes and licensing or
5 regulatory fees.
6 (c) The total amount of an annual rebate required under this section must equal the product of the
7 amount by which the percentage in (1)(a)(i)(C) exceeds the insurer's reported percentage in [section 3]
8 multiplied by the annual premium revenue less federal and state taxes and licensing or regulatory fees.
9 (2) A dental insurer shall provide any rebate owing to a policyholder or certificate holder no later
10 than August 1 of the calendar year following the year for which the ratio described in subsection (1) is
11 calculated.
12
13 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Excess revenue -- rebate. (1) The commissioner shall aggregate dental
14 loss ratios for each dental insurer by year pursuant to [section 3] for each market segment in which the dental
15 insurer operates. The commissioner shall calculate an average dental loss ratio for each market segment using
16 aggregate data for a 3-year period, including data for the most recent dental loss ratio reporting year and the
17 data for the two prior dental loss ratio reporting years. Newer experience is subject to reporting standards
18 specified in 45 CFR 158.121.
19 (2) (a) The commissioner shall calculate an average dental loss ratio for each market segment
20 using the data pursuant to subsection (1), identify as outliers dental plans that fall outside 1 standard deviation
21 of the average dental loss ratio, and report those plans to the legislature as provided in [section 3(4)].
22 (b) A dental insurer may not be considered an outlier if its dental loss ratio in a market segment is
23 within 3 percentage points of the average dental loss ratio. A higher threshold may be set in unique
24 circumstances as determined reasonable by the commissioner.
25 (3) The commissioner shall investigate dental insurers that report a dental loss ratio lower than 1
26 standard deviation from the mathematical average and may take remediation or enforcement actions against
27 them, including ordering them to rebate, in a manner consistent with 45 CFR, part 158, subpart B, all premiums

1 paid above the amounts that would have caused the dental insurer to have achieved the mathematical average
2 of the data submitted in a given year for a given market segment.
3 (4) The report in subsection (2) is organized to show year-over-year changes in a dental insurer’s
4 outlier status relative to meeting the 1 standard deviation outlier standard in subsection (2). If the dental loss
5 ratio for a dental insurer in a market segment does not increase and remains an outlier as described in
6 subsection (2) after 2 consecutive years, barring unique circumstances as determined reasonable by the
7 commissioner, the dental insurer is subject to a minimum dental loss ratio percentage by market segment. The
8 commissioner shall promulgate rules establishing the dental loss ratio percentage based on, at minimum, the
9 average of existing dental insurer loss ratios by market segment in the state to be effective no sooner than 42
10 months after a dental insurer is determined to be an outlier.
11 (5) A dental insurer subject to remediation in subsections (3) and (4) shall provide any rebate
12 owing to a policyholder no later than August 1 of the fiscal year following the year for which the ratio described
13 in subsection (1) was calculated. The commissioner may establish alternatives to direct rebates to include
14 premium reductions in the following benefit year.
15 (6) The commissioner may promulgate rules that create a process to identify dental insurers that
16 increase rates in excess of the percentage increase of the latest dental services consumer price index as
17 reported through the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor.
18
19 NEW SECTION. Section 5. Rulemaking. (1) The commissioner of securities and insurance shall
20 adopt rules to implement the provisions of [sections 1 through 5].
21 (2) (a) The commissioner shall define by rule:
22 (i) expenditures for clinical dental services;
23 (ii) activities that improve dental care quality; and
24 (iii) overhead and administrative cost expenditures.
25 (b) Activities conducted by an issuer intended to improve dental care quality may not exceed 5% of
26 net premium revenue.
27 (3) The definitions promulgated by rule pursuant to this section must be consistent with similar
