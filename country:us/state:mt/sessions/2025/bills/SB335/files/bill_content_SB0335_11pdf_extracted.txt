1 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Definitions. As used in [sections 1 through 5], the following definitions

4 offers coverage for dental services, including excepted benefits as defined in 33-22-140.
5 (b) The term does not include health insurance coverage described in [section 1(4)].
6 (2) "Dental loss ratio" means the percentage of premium dollars spent on patient care as
7 calculated pursuant to subsection (3)(b)(i).
8 (3) (a) "Medical loss ratio" is the minimum percentage of all premium funds collected by an insurer
9 each year that must be spent on actual patient care rather than overhead costs. This minimum required
10 percentage that dental insurance plans must meet for the portion of patient premiums must be dedicated to
11 patient care rather than administrative and overhead costs or the difference must be refunded in the form of a
12 rebate.
13 (b) The dental loss ratio is calculated by dividing the numerator by the denominator, in which:
14 (i) the numerator is the sum of the amount incurred for clinical dental services provided to
15 enrollees, the amount incurred on activities that improve dental care quality, and other incurred claims as
16 defined in 45 CFR 158.140(a); and
17 (ii) the denominator is the total amount of premium revenue, excluding federal and state taxes,

22 issues, sells, or renews a plan, policy, contract, or certificate covering dental services shall file by March 1 of
23 each year with its annual statement a medical dental loss ratio report with the commissioner of securities and
24 insurance that is organized by market and product type and contains similar information required in the 2013
25 federal medical loss ratio annual reporting form. The filing must also report additional data that includes the
26 number of enrollees, the annual maximum coverage limit, and the number of enrollees who meet or exceed the
27 annual coverage limit.

2 meaning as used in the federal Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 300gg-18, and 45 CFR, part 158.
3 (b) If data verification of the dental insurer's representations in the dental loss ratio annual report is
4 considered necessary, the commissioner shall provide the dental insurer with a notification of the additional
5 information needed within 30 days.

7 requested data. The commissioner may extend the time for a dental insurer to comply with this subsection on a
8 finding of good cause.
9 (3) By January 1 of the year after the commissioner receives the dental loss ratio information
10 collected pursuant to [sections 1 through 5], the commissioner shall make the information, including the
11 aggregate dental loss ratio and other data reported pursuant to this section, available to the public in a
12 searchable format on a public website that allows members of the public to compare dental loss ratios among

21 services shall provide an annual rebate or credit to each policyholder or certificate holder:
22 (A) whether individual or part of a group;
23 (B) on a pro rata basis; and
24 (C) if the ratio of the amount of premium revenue expended by the dental insurer on the costs for
25 reimbursement for services provided to policyholders or certificate holders to the total amount of premium
26 revenue, as reported in [section 3], is less than 80%.
27 (ii) The cost of activities that improve dental care quality may be added to the costs for
