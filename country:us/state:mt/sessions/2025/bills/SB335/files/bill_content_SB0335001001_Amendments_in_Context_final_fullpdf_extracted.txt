2 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Definitions. As used in [sections 1 through 5 4], the following definitions

4 (1) (a) "Dental insurer" means an insurance company licensed to do business in the state that
5 offers coverage for dental services, including excepted benefits as defined in 33-22-140.
6 (b) The term does not include health insurance coverage described in [section 1(4)].
7 (2) "Dental loss ratio" means the percentage of premium dollars spent on patient care as
8 calculated pursuant to subsection (3)(b)(i).
9 (3) (a) "Medical loss ratio" is the minimum percentage of all premium funds collected by an insurer
10 each year that must be spent on actual patient care rather than overhead costs. This minimum required
11 percentage that dental insurance plans must meet for the portion of patient premiums must be dedicated to
12 patient care rather than administrative and overhead costs or the difference must be refunded in the form of a
13 rebate.
14 (b) The dental loss ratio is calculated by dividing the numerator by the denominator, in which:
15 (i) the numerator is the sum of the amount incurred for clinical dental services provided to
16 enrollees, the amount incurred on activities that improve dental care quality, and other incurred claims as
17 defined in 45 CFR 158.140(a); and
18 (ii) the denominator is the total amount of premium revenue, excluding federal and state taxes,
19 licensing and regulatory fees paid, nonprofit community benefit expenditures as defined in 45 CFR 158.162(c),
20 and any other payments required by federal law.

25 insurance that is organized by market and product type and contains similar information required in the 2013
26 federal medical loss ratio annual reporting form. The filing must also report additional data that includes the
27 number of enrollees, the annual maximum coverage limit, and the number of enrollees who meet or exceed the

5 (b) If data verification of the dental insurer's representations in the dental loss ratio annual report is
6 considered necessary, the commissioner shall provide the dental insurer with a notification of the additional
7 information needed within 30 days.
8 (c) The dental insurer has 30 days from the date of notification to submit to the commissioner all
9 requested data. The commissioner may extend the time for a dental insurer to comply with this subsection on a
10 finding of good cause.
11 (3) By January 1 of the year after the commissioner receives the dental loss ratio information
12 collected pursuant to [sections 1 through 5 4], the commissioner shall make the information, including the
13 aggregate dental loss ratio and other data reported pursuant to this section, available to the public in a
14 searchable format on a public website that allows members of the public to compare dental loss ratios among

23 services shall provide an annual rebate or credit to each policyholder or certificate holder:
24 (A) whether individual or part of a group;

8 multiplied by the annual premium revenue less federal and state taxes and licensing or regulatory fees.
9 (2) A dental insurer shall provide any rebate owing to a policyholder or certificate holder no later
10 than August 1 of the calendar year following the year for which the ratio described in subsection (1) is
11 calculated.
12
13 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Rulemaking. (1) The commissioner of securities and insurance shall
14 adopt rules to implement the provisions of [sections 1 through 5 4].
15 (2) (a) The commissioner shall define by rule:
16 (i) expenditures for clinical dental services;
17 (ii) activities that improve dental care quality; and
18 (iii) overhead and administrative cost expenditures.
19 (b) Activities conducted by an issuer intended to improve dental care quality may not exceed 5% of
20 net premium revenue.
21 (3) The definitions promulgated by rule pursuant to this section must be consistent with similar
22 definitions that are used for the reporting of medical loss ratios by insurers offering health insurance coverage
23 in the state. Overhead and administrative costs may not be included in the numerator.
