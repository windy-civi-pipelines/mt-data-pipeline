3
5 MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF MARKET-SENSITIVE CROPS AND
6 AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGIES ON MARKETS FOR MONTANA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS; AND
7 REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
8
9 WHEREAS, agriculture is Montana's top production industry and is a central, vital component of this
10 state's economy; and
11 WHEREAS, wheat consistently tops exports of all Montana products in dollar value; and
12 WHEREAS, Montana's agricultural economy has grown in response to demand for more diverse crops,
13 such as pulse crops and other specialty crops; and
14 WHEREAS, export markets have demonstrated volatility due to foreign and domestic trade policies,
15 developing technologies, and instability with global supply and demand; and
16 WHEREAS, many of Montana's export customers place restrictions on market-sensitive crops, such as
17 genetically engineered products and market-sensitive agricultural technologies, including chemical applications;
18 and
19 WHEREAS, three-fourths or more of Montana's wheat is exported, much of it to these sensitive
20 markets; and
21 WHEREAS, Montana's agricultural producers have suffered financial losses when other countries have
22 rejected shipments of their Montana-grown products because of the unexpected presence of sensitive crop
23 material and due to the application of market-sensitive agricultural technologies, including those that result in
24 chemical residues that diminish crop value; and
25 WHEREAS, the Legislature recognizes the importance of maintaining export markets for Montana's
26 agricultural commodities.
27
28 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 23
69th Legislature 2025 SJ 23.1
1 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
2 That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee, pursuant to
3 section 5-5-217, MCA, to examine past market impacts related to market-sensitive crops or the use of market-
4 sensitive agricultural technologies, including detrimental chemical residues on crops grown in Montana.
5 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the study review:
6 (1) the existing export markets for Montana agricultural products;
7 (2) the shipping processes used for major Montana agricultural exports, including the combination
8 of some of Montana's agricultural products with those of nearby states, which results in either upgraded or
9 downgraded quality of the overall product, and the financial impact of that combination for Montana producers;
10 (3) the degree to which import restrictions or prohibitions related to market-sensitive crops and
11 agricultural technologies are affecting exports of Montana agricultural products, including the potential financial
12 impact of the restrictions;
13 (4) the scope of current federal and state regulations regarding the protection of quality for
14 Montana agricultural products and the options for state regulation in the face of import restrictions and
15 prohibitions; and
16 (5) the costs and benefits of market-sensitive crops and the use of agricultural technologies in
17 Montana in terms of profitability, minimalization of chemical applications, unintended consequences, and other
18 impacts on both conventional and organic producers, including but not limited to:
19 (a) the costs or savings to an average Montana producer of producing market-sensitive
20 commodities and using market-sensitive agricultural technologies on a per-scale and per-bushel basis;
21 (b) the market impacts on Montana commodity prices from introduction of market-sensitive crops
22 and market-sensitive agricultural technologies, using for comparison a neighboring state, if any, that has
23 experienced these types of market impacts; and
24 (c) the impacts reported by Montana producers who do not grow market-sensitive crops or use
25 market-sensitive technologies on the integrity of their crops.
26 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the final results of the study, including any findings or conclusions,
27 be presented to and reviewed by an appropriate committee designated by the Legislative Council.
28 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all aspects of the study, including presentation and review
