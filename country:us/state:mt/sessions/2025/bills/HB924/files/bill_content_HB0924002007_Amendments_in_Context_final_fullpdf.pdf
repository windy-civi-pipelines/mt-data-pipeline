6 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
7 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
8 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
9 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
10 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
11 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
12 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
13 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
14 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
15 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
16 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
17 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
18 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
19 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
20 labor.
21 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
22 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
23 including newly taxable property.
24 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:

4 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
5 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
6 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
