1 (i) the methodology and sources of data used by the department in the valuation of the property;
2 and

6 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
7 electronic form:
8 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
9 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
10 market model area; and
11 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the

13 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
14 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
15 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
16 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
17 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
18 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
19 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
20 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
21 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the

1 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
2 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
3 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
4 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
5 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
6 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
7 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
8 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
9 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
10 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
11 for making the adjustment.
12 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
13 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
14 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
15 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
16 office hours.
17 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
18 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
19 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
20 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
21 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
22 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
23 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
24 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
25 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
26 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
27 accordance with the board's order."

2 SECTION 6. SECTION 15-10-420, MCA, IS AMENDED TO READ:
3 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
4 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
5 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
6 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
7 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
8 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
9 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
10 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
11 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
12 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
13 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
14 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
15 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
16 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
17 labor.
18 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
19 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
20 including newly taxable property.
21 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
22 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
23 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
24 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
25 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
26 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
27 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Julie Johnson, HB0924.002.006
1 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
2 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
3 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
4 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
5 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
6 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
7 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
8 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
9 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
10 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
11 following tax year.
12 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
13 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
14 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
15 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
16 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
17 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
18 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:
19 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or
20 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
21 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
22 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
23 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
24 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
25 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
26 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7); and
27 (c) may not include revenue distributed to a county to provide state property tax assistance

3 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated

7 electronic form:
8 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
9 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
10 market model area; and

14 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
15 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
16 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
17 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
18 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
19 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
20 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
21 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the

1 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
2 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
3 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
4 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
5 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
6 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
7 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
8 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
9 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
10 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
11 for making the adjustment.
12 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
13 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
14 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
15 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
16 office hours.
17 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the

19 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
20 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
21 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
22 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
23 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
24 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
25 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
26 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
27 accordance with the board's order."

2 SECTION 6. SECTION 15-10-420, MCA, IS AMENDED TO READ:
3 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
4 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
5 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
6 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
7 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
8 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
9 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
10 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
11 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
12 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
13 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
14 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
15 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
16 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
17 labor.
18 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
19 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
20 including newly taxable property.
21 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
22 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
23 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
24 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
25 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
26 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
27 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an

1 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
2 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
3 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
4 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
5 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
6 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
7 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
8 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
9 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
10 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
11 following tax year.
12 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
13 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
14 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
15 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
16 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
17 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
18 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:
19 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or
20 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
21 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
22 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
23 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
24 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
25 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
26 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7); and
27 (c) may not include revenue distributed to a county to provide state property tax assistance

3 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
4 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
5 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
6 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
7 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
8 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

14 property tax levy for contributions for group benefits excluded under 2-9-212 or 2-18-703;
15 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
16 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
17 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
