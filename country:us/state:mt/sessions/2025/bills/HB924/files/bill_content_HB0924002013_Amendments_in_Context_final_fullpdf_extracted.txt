2 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
3 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
4 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
5 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
6 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
7 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
8 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
9 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.

26 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price

8 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
9 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
10 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
11 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
12 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
13 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
14 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
15 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
16 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
17 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
18 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
19 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
20 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
21 labor.
22 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
23 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
24 including newly taxable property.
25 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:

3 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
4 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
5 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
6 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for

7 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
8 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
9 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
10 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
11 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
12 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
13 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
14 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
15 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
16 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
17 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
18 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
19 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
20 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
21 labor.
22 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
23 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
24 including newly taxable property.
25 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
26 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
27 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;

1 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
2 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
3 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
4 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
5 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
6 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
7 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
8 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
9 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
10 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
11 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
12 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
13 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
14 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
15 following tax year.
16 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
17 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
18 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
19 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
20 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
21 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
22 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:
23 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or
24 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
25 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
26 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.

4 (c) may not include revenue distributed to a county to provide state property tax assistance
5 pursuant to [section 32] [section 35].

7 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
8 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
9 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
10 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
11 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
12 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
13 (ii) a levy to repay taxes paid under protest as provided in 15-1-402;

15 (iv) a levy for the support of a study commission under 7-3-184;
16 (v) a levy for the support of a newly established regional resource authority;
17 (vi) the portion that is the amount in excess of the base contribution of a governmental entity's
18 property tax levy for contributions for group benefits excluded under 2-9-212 or 2-18-703;
19 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
20 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
21 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
22 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
23 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
24 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
25 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) may not be included in the amount of property taxes
26 actually assessed in a subsequent year.
