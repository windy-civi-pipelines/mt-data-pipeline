19 of required jobs, the board may apply a graduated scale to increase the interest rate, not to exceed the board's

21 (g) For purposes of calculating job creation or retention requirements, the board shall use the
22 state's average weekly wage, as defined in 39-71-116, multiplied by the number of jobs required. This
23 calculated number is the minimum aggregate salary threshold that is required to be eligible for a reduced
24 interest rate. If individual jobs created pay less than the state's average weekly wage, the borrower shall create
25 more jobs to meet the minimum aggregate salary threshold. If fewer jobs are created or retained than required
26 in subsection (2)(d)(i) or (2)(d)(ii) but aggregate salaries meet the minimum aggregate salary threshold, the
27 borrower is eligible for the reduced interest rate. A job paying less than the minimum wage, provided for in 39-
28 3-409, may not be included in the required number of jobs.
