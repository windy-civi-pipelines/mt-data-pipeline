1 (c) At the request of the objector or a representative of the objector, and only if the objector or
2 representative signs a written or electronic confidentiality agreement, the department shall provide in written or
3 electronic form:
4 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
5 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
6 market model area; and
7 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the

9 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
10 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
11 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
12 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
13 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
14 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
15 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
16 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
17 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
18 department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
19 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
20 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
21 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
22 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
23 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
24 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
25 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
26 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
27 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
28 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.

3 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
4 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
5 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing

9 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
10 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
11 office hours.
12 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
13 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
14 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
15 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
16 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
17 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
18 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
19 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
20 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
21 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
22 accordance with the board's order."

3 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
4 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
