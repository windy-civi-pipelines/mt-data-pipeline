69th Legislature 2025 HB0924.2
1 electronic form:
2 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;
3 (ii) sales data used by the department to value residential property in the property taxpayer's
4 market model area; and
5 (iii) if the cost approach was used by the department to value residential property, the
6 documentation required in 15-8-111(3) regarding why the comparable sales approach was not reliable.
7 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
8 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
9 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
10 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
11 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
12 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
13 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
14 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
15 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
16 department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
17 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
18 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
19 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
20 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
21 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
22 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
23 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
24 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
25 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
26 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
27 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
28 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – HB 924

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0924.2
1 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
2 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
3 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
4 for making the adjustment.
5 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
6 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
7 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
8 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
9 office hours.
10 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
11 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
12 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
13 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
14 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
15 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
16 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
17 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
18 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
19 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
20 accordance with the board's order."

22 SECTION 6. SECTION 15-10-420, MCA, IS AMENDED TO READ:
23 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
24 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
25 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
26 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
27 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
28 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 924

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0924.2
1 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
2 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
3 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
4 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
5 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
6 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
7 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
8 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
9 labor.
10 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
11 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
12 including newly taxable property.
13 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
14 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
15 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
16 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
17 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
18 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
19 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
20 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
21 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
22 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
23 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
24 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
25 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
26 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
27 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
28 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 924

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0924.2
1 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
2 following tax year.
3 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
4 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
5 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
6 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
7 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
8 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
9 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:
10 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or
11 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
12 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
13 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
14 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
15 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
16 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
17 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7); and
18
19 (c) may not include revenue distributed to a county to provide state property tax assistance
20 pursuant to [section 32].
21 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
22 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
23 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
24 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
25 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
26 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
27 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
28 (ii) a levy to repay taxes paid under protest as provided in 15-1-402;

2 (iv) a levy for the support of a study commission under 7-3-184;
3 (v) a levy for the support of a newly established regional resource authority;
4 (vi) the portion that is the amount in excess of the base contribution of a governmental entity's
5 property tax levy for contributions for group benefits excluded under 2-9-212 or 2-18-703;
6 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
7 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
8 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
9 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
10 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
11 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
12 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) may not be included in the amount of property taxes
13 actually assessed in a subsequent year.
14 (10) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
15 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
