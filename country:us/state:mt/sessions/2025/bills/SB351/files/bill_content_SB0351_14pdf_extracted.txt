11 Section 1. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
13 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
14 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
15 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
16 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
17 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
18 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
19 (b) (i) A Except as provided in subsection (1)(b)(ii), a governmental entity that does not impose the
20 maximum number of mills authorized under subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the
21 number of mills equal to the difference between the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number
22 of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
23 (ii) The authority to carry forward mills provided for in subsection (1)(b)(i) does not apply to mills
24 imposed under 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, or 20-25-439.
25 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
26 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
27 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
28 labor.

69th Legislature 2025 SB 351.1
1 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
2 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
3 including newly taxable property.
4 (3) (a) For the purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
5 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
6 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
7 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
8 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
9 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
10 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
11 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
12 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
13 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
14 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
15 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
16 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
17 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
18 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
19 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
20 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
21 following tax year.
22 (c) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property
23 that was constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the
24 current year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
25 (d) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the
26 first sale of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
27 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).

3 (6) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds
4 taxes received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
5 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
6 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
7 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
8 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
9 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the
10 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
11 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
12 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
13 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
14 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
15 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

23 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
24 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
25 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
