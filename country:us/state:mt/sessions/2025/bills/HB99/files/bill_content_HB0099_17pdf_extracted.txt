(4) (a) On a conviction referred to in subsection (1) of a person who holds a commercial driver's

person's driving record. The provisions of this subsection (4)(a) apply only to the conviction of a person who
holds a commercial driver's license or who is required to hold a commercial driver's license and do not apply to
the conviction of a person who holds any other type of driver's license.

203 or 16-12-508 is convicted of or pleads guilty to any offense related to driving under the influence of alcohol

which the conviction occurs shall require the person to surrender the registry identification card or license.
(b) Within 5 days after the conviction, the court shall forward the registry identification card and a
copy of the conviction to the department of revenue.
(6) A person convicted of violating this section is subject to the penalties provided in 61-5-307."
