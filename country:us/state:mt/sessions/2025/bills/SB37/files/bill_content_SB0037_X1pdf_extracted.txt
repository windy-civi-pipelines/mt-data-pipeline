3 years prior by 110% or more. The significant enrollment increase payment the district qualifies for must be
calculated by the superintendent of public instruction no later than December 1 following the October
enrollment count as the difference between:
(i) an amount equal to 80% of the district's total per-ANB entitlement for that fiscal year if the

absorption factor; and

amendment for any accepted amount. A budget amendment under this section must be made by resolution of
the trustees of the district and is not subject to the requirements of other budget amendments under Title 20,
chapter 9, part 1. The trustees shall provide a copy of the budget amendment to the superintendent of public
instruction in a manner determined by the superintendent of public instruction.
(iii) On receiving a copy of the budget amendment, the superintendent of public instruction shall
disburse from the BASE aid appropriation in House Bill No. 2 the amount of the accepted payment distributed
with the remaining direct state aid payments for that fiscal year pursuant to 20-9-344.
(d) A district receiving additional financial support under this subsection (2) shall deposit the
money in the district's general fund and use it to address costs associated with the enrollment increase.
