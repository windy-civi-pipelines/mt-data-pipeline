2 count in the current year converted to ANB must exceed the district's budget limit ANB for the school fiscal year
3 3 years prior by 110% or more. The significant enrollment increase payment the district qualifies for must be
4 calculated by the superintendent of public instruction no later than December 1 following the October
5 enrollment count as the difference between:
6 (i) an amount equal to 80% of the district's total per-ANB entitlement for that fiscal year if the
7 district's budget limit ANB was calculated using the district's actual October enrollment count minus the
8 absorption factor; and
9 (ii) 80% of the district's total per-ANB entitlement for that fiscal year.
10 (c) (i) The superintendent of public instruction shall notify a district of the district's eligibility for a
11 significant enrollment increase payment and the amount by December 15.
12 (ii) The trustees of the district shall determine at the next scheduled board meeting and no later
13 than March 1 whether to accept the full or a partial amount of the payment and adopt a general fund budget
14 amendment for any accepted amount. A budget amendment under this section must be made by resolution of
15 the trustees of the district and is not subject to the requirements of other budget amendments under Title 20,
16 chapter 9, part 1. The trustees shall provide a copy of the budget amendment to the superintendent of public
17 instruction in a manner determined by the superintendent of public instruction.
18 (iii) On receiving a copy of the budget amendment, the superintendent of public instruction shall
19 disburse from the BASE aid appropriation in House Bill No. 2 the amount of the accepted payment distributed
20 with the remaining direct state aid payments for that fiscal year pursuant to 20-9-344.
21 (d) A district receiving additional financial support under this subsection (2) shall deposit the
22 money in the district's general fund and use it to address costs associated with the enrollment increase.
23 (e) For the purposes of this subsection (2), "absorption factor" means an ANB amount rounded to
24 the nearest whole number equal to the sum of 5 ANB plus 3% of the district's budget limit ANB for that fiscal
25 year."
