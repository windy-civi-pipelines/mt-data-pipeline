- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 14
69th Legislature 2025 SJ 14.1
1 WHEREAS, these lands are managed and treated as defacto wilderness in lieu of congressional action
2 to designate or release the lands, a situation that has resulted in a waste of forest assets, no management of
3 public forests, and a harmful reduction in forest road construction and multiple-use access improvements; and
4 WHEREAS, the failure by Congress to release the lands designated for study by the Montana
5 Wilderness Study Act of 1977 and the National Landscape Conservation System or designated as roadless by
6 the Roadless Area Conservation Rule severely impedes Montana citizens from multiple uses of the lands,
7 thereby severely harming agriculture, timber harvesting, and other multiple-use interests, as well as Montana
8 communities and Montana families economically supported by those activities; and
9 WHEREAS, it is the consensus of the Montana Legislature that more than sufficient time has passed
10 for the study of these lands as to their suitability for preservation as wilderness; and
11 WHEREAS, national forest lands released from wilderness study or the roadless inventory would still
12 be subject to the National Forest Management Act, which requires extensive public involvement as the agency
13 develops and updates plans for the management and use of resources in each forest; and
14 WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature on behalf of the citizens of the state assert that the time is ripe for
15 final disposition of these lands.
16
17 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
18 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
19 That the Legislature supports scientific adaptive management to implement the multiple-use mandate
20 of public land use as mandated by the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 and the Federal Land Policy
21 and Management Act of 1976 to ensure the protection and improvement of public land health and to maintain
22 and improve the sustainability of federal lands, including forests, located in Montana.
23 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature formally petitions Congress to enact legislation
24 releasing all wilderness study areas identified and specified in the Montana Wilderness Study Act of 1977 and
25 in the National Landscape Conservation System and all inventoried roadless areas identified by the Roadless
26 Area Conservation Rule in order to secure the rights of Montana citizens to use these public lands for public
27 purposes, including multiple uses, unless Congress confirms a study area for inclusion in the National
28 Wilderness Preservation System.
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 14
69th Legislature 2025 SJ 14.1
1 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature petitions Congress to release all wilderness study
2 areas and inventoried roadless areas and implement the concept of multiple use in order to fulfill the federal
3 mandate as required by the Organic Act of 1897 to manage the national forests to "improve and protect the
4 forest within the reservation, or for the purpose of securing favorable conditions of water flows, and to furnish a
5 continuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of citizens of the United States".
6 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in its deliberations, Congress consider the land management
7 alternatives in view of the Organic Act of 1897 in conjunction with the 2007 water rights compact between the
8 state of Montana and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, since land management directly
9 impacts the volume, quantity, and timing of water flows from watersheds in these wilderness study areas and
10 impacts downstream water rights holders.
11 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature urges the Secretary of the Department of
12 Agriculture to direct the Forest Service to immediately evaluate the impacts of the land management
13 alternatives on the watersheds in the Montana wilderness study areas and downstream water rights holders to
14 help inform Congress in its deliberations.
15 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature urges the Secretary of the Department of the
16 Interior to direct the Bureau of Land Management to immediately evaluate the impacts of the land management
17 alternatives on the watersheds in the Montana wilderness study areas and downstream water rights holders to
18 help inform Congress in its deliberations.
19 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State send copies of this resolution to the
20 Governor, the Montana Congressional Delegation, the United States Secretary of the Interior, the United States
21 Secretary of Agriculture, the Chief of the Forest Service, and the Director of the Bureau of Land Management.
