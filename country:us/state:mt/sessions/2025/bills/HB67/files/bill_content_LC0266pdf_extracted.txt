2 entered service at that time as a new member
3 (2) (a) Upon subsequent termination of employment in all teachers' retirement system reportable
4 positions, a member who is then eligible based on age or service for either an early retirement allowance under
5 19-20-802 or a regular retirement allowance under 19-20-804 may immediately apply for a retirement
6 allowance. Eligibility for retirement based on service is determined based on the creditable service credited to

9 (i) the early or regular service retirement allowance the member is eligible to receive based on the

11 retirement excluding any creditable service or earned compensation enhancement applied as provided in 19-

15 member status plus a second benefit amount calculated based on the creditable service accrued and average
16 earned compensation credited for all years of service during the return to active member status.
17 (b) Upon subsequent termination of employment in all teachers' retirement system reportable
18 positions, a member who is not then eligible for an early or regular service retirement allowance under
19 subsection (2)(a) shall wait to apply for a subsequent retirement allowance until eligible under subsection (2)(a)
20 or may make a new application for a disability retirement allowance.
21 (c) A member who originally retired on a disability allowance and later returned to active member
22 status may not make, and the member's subsequent retirement allowance may not be enhanced by, any
23 permissive service purchase not used in the calculation of the member's original disability retirement
24 allowance."

22 status may not make, and the member's subsequent retirement allowance may not be enhanced by, any
23 permissive service purchase not used in the calculation of the member's original disability retirement
