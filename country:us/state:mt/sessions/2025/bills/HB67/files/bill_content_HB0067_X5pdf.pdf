option described in 19-20-702(3)(a)(i) without consideration of the member's age.
(4) The life expectancy of a member or the member's joint annuitant may not be recalculated after
benefits commence.
(5) If a member terminates within 30 days of the last day of the school year, the member is
considered to have terminated at the end of the member's contract, and the retirement allowance may not
commence earlier than the first day of the month following the last scheduled pupil-instruction day or pupil-
instruction-related day as described in 20-1-304, whichever is later."
Section 7. Section 19-20-905, MCA, is amended to read:
"19-20-905. Cancellation of allowance and restoration of membership. (1) If a disabled retiree is
employed in a position reportable to the retirement system and earns compensation in any calendar year in
excess of the limitation provided in 19-20-904, the retiree's retirement allowance must cease and the retiree
must again become an active member of the retirement system effective on the first day of the month following
the month in which the earnings limitation was exceeded. At this point, the member is deemed to be no longer
disabled.
(2) If the member is restored to active membership on or after the attainment of the age of 55
years, the member's retirement allowance upon subsequent retirement may not exceed the retirement
allowance that the member would have received had the member remained in service during the period of the
member's previous retirement or the sum of the retirement allowance that the member was receiving
immediately prior to the member's last restoration to service and the retirement allowance that the member
would have received on account of the member's service since the member's last restoration had the member
entered service at that time as a new member
(2) (a) Upon subsequent termination of employment in all teachers' retirement system reportable
positions, a member who is then eligible based on age or service for either an early retirement allowance under
19-20-802 or a regular retirement allowance under 19-20-804 may immediately apply for a retirement
allowance. Eligibility for retirement based on service is determined based on the creditable service credited to
the member at the time of disability retirement excluding any creditable service enhancement applied pursuant
to 19-20-902(1)(b). The retirement allowance payable upon subsequent retirement is the lesser of:

(i) the early or regular service retirement allowance the member is eligible to receive based on the
creditable service and earned compensation credited to the member at the time of the member's disability
retirement excluding any creditable service or earned compensation enhancement applied as provided in 19-
20-902(1)(b), plus the additional creditable service and earned compensation credited to the member after the
return to active member status; or
(ii) an amount equal to the disability retirement benefit received prior to the return to active
member status plus a second benefit amount calculated based on the creditable service accrued and average
earned compensation credited for all years of service during the return to active member status.
(b) Upon subsequent termination of employment in all teachers' retirement system reportable
positions, a member who is not then eligible for an early or regular service retirement allowance under
subsection (2)(a) shall wait to apply for a subsequent retirement allowance until eligible under subsection (2)(a)
or may make a new application for a disability retirement allowance.
(c) A member who originally retired on a disability allowance and later returned to active member
status may not make, and the member's subsequent retirement allowance may not be enhanced by, any
permissive service purchase not used in the calculation of the member's original disability retirement
allowance."
