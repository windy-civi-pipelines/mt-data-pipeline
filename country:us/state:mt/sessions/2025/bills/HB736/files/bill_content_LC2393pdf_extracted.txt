9
10 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Nutrient pollutant loading offsets. (1) A point source discharger
11 permitted pursuant to this part may receive a nutrient pollutant loading offset to achieve waste load allocations
12 set by:
13 (a) a total maximum daily load requirement established pursuant to 75-5-703; or
14 (b) a numeric nutrient effluent limitation established pursuant to this part.
15 (2) If the actions in subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) decrease the nutrient loading in a watershed, the
16 department may:
17 (a) issue or modify a discharge permit authorized pursuant to this part to allow discharges of
18 nutrients to a receiving water body; or
19 (b) authorize a reduction in nutrient loading from point and nonpoint pollution sources within the
20 same 12-digit hydrologic unit code subbasin as designated by the United States geological survey.
21 (3) A point source discharger permitted pursuant to this part may receive a nutrient pollutant
22 loading offset due to a reduction in nutrient loading from a point or nonpoint source pollution discharger either
23 up gradient or down gradient of the permitted point source discharger. The offset must be measured as not less
24 than:
25 (a) 100% of a reduction from point source pollution discharges;
26 (b) 80% of a reduction from an up-gradient, nonpoint source pollution discharge; or
27 (c) 50% of a reduction from a down-gradient, nonpoint source pollution discharge.
28 (4) The department shall establish statewide nutrient pollutant loading offset amounts for nonpoint

1 pollution sources, including offset amounts for:
2 (a) riparian fencing programs based on the number of acres fenced;
3 (b) riparian vegetation programs based on the number of acres vegetated;
4 (c) development of wetlands in areas of irrigation water return flows based on the number of acres
5 associated with the return flows;
6 (d) removal of septic systems based on the number and size of septic systems removed; or
7 (e) other projects submitted by an applicant that are supported by science and data modeling,
8 unless the amounts are contrary to existing empirical data.

10 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Directions to department. To implement the provisions of [section 1],
11 the department shall amend:
12 (1) department circular DEQ-13, Montana's policy for nutrient trading, as adopted in December
