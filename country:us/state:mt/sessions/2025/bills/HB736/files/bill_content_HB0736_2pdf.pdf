4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT PROVIDING FOR NUTRIENT POLLUTANT LOADING OFFSETS,
5 OFFSET AMOUNTS, AND TRADING CREDITS FOR WATER QUALITY DISCHARGE PERMITS; PROVIDING
6 RULEMAKING AUTHORITY; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE.”

8 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
9
10 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Nutrient pollutant loading offsets AND TRADING CREDITS. (1) A point
11 source discharger permitted UNDER A PERMIT ISSUED pursuant to this part 75-5-401, A POINT SOURCE DISCHARGER
12 TO STATE SURFACE WATERS may receive a nutrient pollutant loading offset OFFSETS OR TRADING CREDITS to
13 achieve SATISFY PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING NUTRIENT EFFLUENT LIMITATIONS ESTABLISHED PURSUANT
14 TO THIS PART AND NUTRIENT EFFLUENT LIMITATIONS DERIVED FROM waste load allocations set by: ESTABLISHED
15 PURSUANT TO 75-5-703.
16 (a) a total maximum daily load requirement established pursuant to 75-5-703; or
17 (b) a numeric nutrient effluent limitation established pursuant to this part.
18 (2) If the actions in subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b) decrease the nutrient loading in a watershed, the
19 department may:
20 (a) issue or modify a discharge permit authorized pursuant to this part to allow discharges of
21 nutrients to a receiving water body ; or
22 (b) authorize a reduction in nutrient loading from point and nonpoint pollution sources within the
23 same 12-digit hydrologic unit code subbasin as designated by the United States geological survey.
24 (2) NUTRIENT LOADING OFFSETS AND TRADING CREDITS MAY BE AUTHORIZED FOR INCREASES IN OR
25 CONTINUATION OF NUTRIENT DISCHARGES WHEN A NET DECREASE IN NUTRIENT LOADING WITHIN THE UNITED STATES
26 GEOLOGICAL SURVEY-DESIGNATED 12-DIGIT HYDROLOGIC UNIT CODE SUBBASIN, OR IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT 12-DIGIT
27 HYDROLOGIC UNIT CODE SUBBASIN WHEN THE PROJECT IS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE ADJACENT 12-DIGIT HYDROLOGIC
28 UNIT CODE SUBBASIN, IS ACHIEVED THROUGH REDUCTIONS FROM OTHER POINT SOURCES OR NONPOINT SOURCES

69th Legislature 2025 HB0736.2
1 WITHIN THE SUBBASIN, EITHER UP GRADIENT OR DOWN GRADIENT OF THE APPLICANT. THE APPLICANT SHALL QUANTIFY
2 AND VERIFY REDUCTIONS FROM PROJECTS BASED ON THE METHODOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY THE DEPARTMENT
3 PURSUANT TO SUBSECTION (4) OR BASED ON SUFFICIENT AND CREDIBLE SITE-SPECIFIC DATA AND METHODOLOGIES
4 THAT ARE REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED BY THE DEPARTMENT.
5 (3) A point source discharger permitted pursuant to this part may receive a nutrient pollutant
6 loading offset due to a reduction in nutrient loading from a point or nonpoint source pollution discharger either
7 up gradient or down gradient of the permitted point source discharger. FOR REDUCTIONS THAT SATISFY
8 SUBSECTIONS (2) AND (4), The THE offset OR TRADING CREDIT must be measured as not less than:
9 (a) 100% of a reduction from point source pollution discharges;
10 (b) 80% of a reduction from an up-gradient, nonpoint source pollution discharge; or
11 (c) 50% of a reduction from a down-gradient, nonpoint source pollution discharge.
12 (4) (A) The department shall establish statewide nutrient pollutant loading ACCEPTABLE
13 METHODOLOGIES, BASED ON READILY AVAILABLE WATERSHED CHARACTERISTICS, TO DETERMINE THE REDUCTION IN
14 NUTRIENT LOADING FOR NONPOINT SOURCES offset amount s for nonpoint pollution sources, including offset
15 amounts for:
16 (a)(I) riparian fencing programs based on the number of acres fenced FEET OF STREAMBANK;
17 (b)(II) riparian vegetation programs based on the number of acres vegetated;
18 (c)(III) development of wetlands in areas of irrigation water return flows based on the number of acres
19 associated with the return flows; OR
20 (d)(IV) removal of septic systems based on the number and size of septic systems removed ; or.
21 (e)(B) other OTHER projects AND METHODS MAY BE submitted PROPOSED by an applicant OR PERMITTEE
22 that are supported by science and data modeling, unless the amounts are AND ARE NOT contrary to existing
23 empirical data.
24 (C) THE DEPARTMENT SHALL USE THE METHODOLOGIES ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO THIS SUBSECTION (4)
25 UNLESS THERE IS CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT THE NUTRIENT LOADING OF THE PROPOSED ACTION WOULD
26 BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT DETERMINED BY THE ESTABLISHED METHODOLOGIES.
