1 (d)(c) require a familial, marital, or employment relationship between the occupants of the single-
2 family dwelling and the occupants of the accessory dwelling unit;
3 (e)(d) assess impact fees on the construction of an accessory dwelling unit;
4 (f)(e) require improvements to public streets as a condition of permitting an accessory dwelling unit,
5 except as necessary to reconstruct or repair a public street that is disturbed as a result of the construction of
6 the accessory dwelling unit;
7 (g)(f) set maximum building heights, minimum setback requirements, minimum lot sizes, maximum
8 lot coverages, or minimum building frontages for accessory dwelling units that are more restrictive than those
9 for the single-family dwelling on the lot;
10 (h)(g) impose more onerous development standards on an accessory dwelling unit beyond those set
11 forth in this section; or
12 (i)(h) require a restrictive covenant concerning an accessory dwelling unit on a parcel zoned for
13 residential use by a single-family dwelling. This subsection (2)(i)(2)(h) may not be construed to prohibit
14 restrictive covenants concerning accessory dwelling units entered into between private parties, but the county
15 may not condition a permit, license, or use of an accessory dwelling unit on the adoption or implementation of a

22 (5) A county that has not adopted or amended regulations pursuant to this section by [the effective
23 date of this act] shall review and permit accessory dwelling units in accordance with the requirements of this
24 section until regulations are adopted or amended. Regulations in effect on or after [the effective date of this
25 act], that apply to accessory dwelling units and do not comply with this section are void.
26 (6) The provisions of this section do not supersede applicable building codes, fire codes, or public
27 health and safety regulations adopted pursuant to Title 50, chapter 2.
