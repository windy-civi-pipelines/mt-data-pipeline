13 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Short title. [Sections 1 through 4] may be cited as the "Responsible
14 Restroom Allocation Act".
15
16 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Legislative findings -- purpose. (1) The legislature finds that menstrual
17 products are specifically designed for individuals who experience menstruation, a biological function exclusive
18 to females and that providing menstrual products in male-designated restrooms is unnecessary and represents
19 an inefficient use of public funds.
20 (2) The legislature further finds that the proper allocation of public education resources should
21 prioritize essential educational needs, school safety, and services that directly benefit students based on
22 biological realities and practical necessity.
23 (3) The legislature acknowledges that the governor has signed House Bill No. 121 in 2025, which
24 establishes that individuals may only use bathrooms corresponding to their biological sex in public facilities.
25 However, this act remains necessary to ensure that restroom facilities in Montana public schools and
26 universities are appropriately designated not only in terms of access but also in the allocation of resources,
27 ensuring that taxpayer funds are used efficiently and in accordance with biological realities.
28 (4) The purpose of [this act] is to ensure that taxpayer resources are allocated appropriately and
