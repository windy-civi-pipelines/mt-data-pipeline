20 productive and enjoyable harmony between humans and their environment, to protect the right to use and enjoy
21 private property free of undue government regulation, to promote efforts that will prevent, mitigate, or eliminate
22 damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of humans, to enrich the
23 understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the state, and to establish an
24 environmental quality council.
25 (3) (a) The purpose of requiring an environmental assessment and an environmental impact
26 statement under part 2 of this chapter is to assist the legislature in determining whether laws are adequate to
27 address impacts to Montana's environment and to inform the public and public officials of potential impacts

5 concerning alternative uses of available resources. If the alternatives analysis is conducted for a project that is
6 not a state-sponsored project and alternatives are recommended, the project sponsor may volunteer to

23 official shall also consult with and obtain comments from any state agency in Montana with respect to any
24 regulation of private property involved. Copies of the statement and the comments and views of the appropriate

2 issue, comment, argument, proposed alternative, analysis, or evidence, that was not first presented to the
3 agency for the agency's consideration prior to the agency's decision or within the time allowed for comments to
4 be submitted.
5 (iv)(iii) Except as provided in subsection (6)(b), the court shall confine its review to the record certified

9 impact analysis is inadequate may not be used as the basis of an action challenging or seeking review of the

15 review.
16 (ii) If upon reviewing the affidavit the court finds that the proffered information is new, material, and
17 significant evidence that was not publicly available before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the
18 decision or to the adequacy of the agency's environmental review, the court shall remand the new evidence to
19 the agency for the agency's consideration and an opportunity to modify its decision or environmental review
20 before the court considers the evidence as a part of the administrative record under review.

1 pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
2 injunction, permanent injunction, vacatur, or other equitable relief may not enjoin, void, nullify, revoke, modify,
3 or suspend the issuance or effectiveness of a license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant
4 to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not
5 to prevail on the merits of its complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in
6 the absence of a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, vacatur, or other
7 equitable relief, that the:
8 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
9 (B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
10 the public interest, a court:
11 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
12 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
13 findings with respect to both.
14 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
15 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
16 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
17 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
18 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
19 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
20 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
21 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
22 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
23 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking
24 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
25 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
26 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
27 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
28 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an

1 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
2 and an An injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
3 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
4 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
5 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
6 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
7 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
8 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
9 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
10 (f) Attorney fees or costs may not be awarded to the prevailing party in an action alleging
11 noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3.
12 (7) For the purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
13 inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
14 to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
15 that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding
16 pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
17 (8) The director of the agency responsible for the determination or recommendation shall endorse
18 in writing any determination of significance made under subsection (1)(b)(iv) or any recommendation that a
19 determination of significance be made.
20 (9) A project sponsor may request a review of the significance determination or recommendation
21 made under subsection (8) by the appropriate board, if any. The appropriate board may, at its discretion, submit
22 an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue. The period of time between the request for a
23 review and completion of a review under this subsection may not be included for the purposes of determining

12 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
13 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and

16 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
17 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
