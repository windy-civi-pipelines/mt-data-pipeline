12 "75-1-102. Intent -- purpose. (1) The legislature, mindful of its constitutional obligations under Article
13 II, section 3, and Article IX of the Montana constitution, has enacted the Montana Environmental Policy Act. The
14 Montana Environmental Policy Act is procedural, and it is the legislature's intent that the requirements of parts 1
15 through 3 of this chapter provide for the adequate review of state actions in order to ensure that:
16 (a) environmental attributes are fully considered by the legislature in enacting laws to fulfill
17 constitutional obligations; and
18 (b) the public is informed of the anticipated impacts in Montana of potential state actions.
19 (2) The purpose of parts 1 through 3 of this chapter is to declare a state policy that will encourage
20 productive and enjoyable harmony between humans and their environment, to protect the right to use and enjoy
21 private property free of undue government regulation, to promote efforts that will prevent, mitigate, or eliminate
22 damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of humans, to enrich the
23 understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the state, and to establish an
24 environmental quality council.
25 (3) (a) The purpose of requiring an environmental assessment and an environmental impact
26 statement under part 2 of this chapter is to assist the legislature in determining whether laws are adequate to
27 address impacts to Montana's environment and to inform the public and public officials of potential impacts
28 resulting from decisions made by state agencies.

5 Section 2. Section 75-1-201, MCA, is amended to read:
6 "75-1-201. General directions -- environmental impact statements. (1) The legislature authorizes
7 and directs that, to the fullest extent possible:
8 (a) the policies, regulations, and laws of the state must be interpreted and administered in
9 accordance with the policies set forth in parts 1 through 3;
10 (b) under this part, all agencies of the state, except the legislature and except as provided in
11 subsections subsection (2) and (3), shall:
12 (i) use a systematic, interdisciplinary approach that will ensure:
13 (A) the integrated use of the natural and social sciences and the environmental design arts in
14 planning and in decisionmaking for a state-sponsored project that may have an impact on the Montana human
15 environment by projects in Montana; and
16 (B) that in any environmental review that is not subject to subsection (1)(b)(iv), when an agency
17 considers alternatives, the alternative analysis will be in compliance with the provisions of subsections
18 (1)(b)(iv)(C)(I) and (1)(b)(iv)(C)(II) and, if requested by the project sponsor or if determined by the agency to be
19 necessary, subsection (1)(b)(iv)(C)(III);
20 (ii) identify and develop methods and procedures that will ensure that presently unquantified
21 environmental amenities and values may be given appropriate consideration in decisionmaking for state-
22 sponsored projects, along with economic and technical considerations;
23 (iii) identify and develop methods and procedures that will ensure that state government actions
24 that may impact the human environment in Montana are evaluated for regulatory restrictions on private
25 property, as provided in subsection (1)(b)(iv)(D);
26 (iv) include in each recommendation or report on proposals for projects, programs, and other major
27 actions of state government significantly affecting the quality of the human environment in Montana a detailed
28 statement on:
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – HB 270
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 270.1
1 (A) the environmental impact of the proposed action;
2 (B) any adverse effects on Montana's environment that cannot be avoided if the proposal is
3 implemented;
4 (C) alternatives to the proposed action. An analysis of any alternative included in the environmental
5 review must comply with the following criteria:
6 (I) any alternative proposed must be reasonable, in that the alternative must be achievable under
7 current technology and the alternative must be economically feasible as determined solely by the economic
8 viability for similar projects having similar conditions and physical locations and determined without regard to
9 the economic strength of the specific project sponsor;
10 (II) the agency proposing the alternative shall consult with the project sponsor regarding any
11 proposed alternative, and the agency shall give due weight and consideration to the project sponsor's
12 comments regarding the proposed alternative;
13 (III) the agency shall complete a meaningful no-action alternative analysis. The no-action
14 alternative analysis must include the projected beneficial and adverse environmental, social, and economic
15 impact of the project's noncompletion.
16 (D) any regulatory impacts on private property rights, including whether alternatives that reduce,
17 minimize, or eliminate the regulation of private property rights have been analyzed. The analysis in this
18 subsection (1)(b)(iv)(D) need not be prepared if the proposed action does not involve the regulation of private
19 property.
20 (E) the relationship between local short-term uses of the Montana human environment and the
21 maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity;
22 (F) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources that would be involved in the
23 proposed action if it is implemented;
24 (G) the customer fiscal impact analysis, if required by 69-2-216; and
25 (H) the details of the beneficial aspects of the proposed project, both short-term and long-term, and
26 the economic advantages and disadvantages of the proposal;
27 (v) in accordance with the criteria set forth in subsection (1)(b)(iv)(C), study, develop, and describe
28 appropriate alternatives to recommend courses of action in any proposal that involves unresolved conflicts

69th Legislature 2025 HB 270.1
1 concerning alternative uses of available resources. If the alternatives analysis is conducted for a project that is
2 not a state-sponsored project and alternatives are recommended, the project sponsor may volunteer to
3 implement the alternative. Neither the alternatives analysis nor the resulting recommendations bind the project
4 sponsor to take a recommended course of action, but the project sponsor may agree pursuant to subsection
5 (4)(b) (3)(b) to a specific course of action.
6 (vi) recognize the potential long-range character of environmental impacts in Montana and, when
7 consistent with the policies of the state, lend appropriate support to initiatives, resolutions, and programs
8 designed to maximize cooperation in anticipating and preventing a decline in the quality of Montana's
9 environment;
10 (vii) make available to counties, municipalities, institutions, and individuals advice and information
11 useful in restoring, maintaining, and enhancing the quality of Montana's environment;
12 (viii) initiate and use ecological information in the planning and development of resource-oriented
13 projects; and
14 (ix) assist the legislature and the environmental quality council established by 5-16-101;
15 (c) prior to making any detailed statement as provided in subsection (1)(b)(iv), the responsible
16 state official shall consult with and obtain the comments of any state agency that has jurisdiction by law or
17 special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved in Montana and with any Montana local
18 government, as defined in 7-12-1103, that may be directly impacted by the project. The responsible state
19 official shall also consult with and obtain comments from any state agency in Montana with respect to any
20 regulation of private property involved. Copies of the statement and the comments and views of the appropriate
21 state, federal, and local agencies that are authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards must be
22 made available to the governor, the environmental quality council, and the public and must accompany the
23 proposal through the existing agency review processes.
24 (d) a transfer of an ownership interest in a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for
25 use or permission to act by an agency, either singly or in combination with other state agencies, does not
26 trigger review under subsection (1)(b)(iv) if there is not a material change in terms or conditions of the
27 entitlement or unless otherwise provided by law.
28 (2) (a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), an environmental review conducted pursuant to

11 to act based on parts 1 through 3 of this chapter.
12 (b) Nothing in this subsection (4) (3) prevents a project sponsor and an agency from mutually
13 developing measures that may, at the request of a project sponsor, be incorporated into a permit or other
14 authority to act.
15 (c) Parts 1 through 3 of this chapter do not confer authority to an agency that is a project sponsor
16 to modify a proposed project or action.
17 (5)(4) (a) (i) A challenge to an agency's environmental review under this part may only be brought
18 against a final agency action decision and may only be brought in district court or in federal court, whichever is
19 appropriate. A challenge may only be brought by a person who submits formal comments on the agency's
20 environmental review prior to the agency's final decision, and the challenge must be limited to those issues
21 addressed in those comments.
22 (ii) Any action or proceeding challenging a final agency action alleging failure to comply with or
23 inadequate compliance with a requirement under this part must be brought within 60 days of the action that is
24 the subject of the challenge.
25 (iii) For an action taken by the board of land commissioners or the department of natural resources
26 and conservation under Title 77, "final agency action" means the date that the board of land commissioners or

6 parts 1 through 3, including a challenge to an agency's decision that an environmental review is not required or
7 a claim that the environmental review is inadequate, the agency shall compile and submit to the court the
8 certified record of its decision at issue. The agency, prior to submitting the certified record to the court, shall
9 assess and collect from the person challenging the decision a fee to pay for actual costs to compile and submit

- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 270
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 270.1
1 agency's decision.
2 (b) (i) When a party challenging the decision or the adequacy of the environmental review or
3 decision presents information not in the record certified by the agency, the challenging party shall certify under
4 oath in an affidavit that the information is new, material, and significant evidence that was not publicly available
5 before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the decision or the adequacy of the agency's environmental
6 review.
7 (ii) If upon reviewing the affidavit the court finds that the proffered information is new, material, and
8 significant evidence that was not publicly available before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the
9 decision or to the adequacy of the agency's environmental review, the court shall remand the new evidence to
10 the agency for the agency's consideration and an opportunity to modify its decision or environmental review
11 before the court considers the evidence as a part of the administrative record under review.
12 (iii) If the court finds that the information in the affidavit does not meet the requirements of
13 subsection (6)(b)(i) (5)(b)(i), the court may not remand the matter to the agency or consider the proffered
14 information in making its decision.
15 (c) (i) The remedies provided in this section for successful challenges to a decision of the agency
16 or the adequacy of the statement are exclusive.
17 (ii) If the court finds that noncompliance has occurred with parts 1 through 3 of this chapter, the

19 (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-19-201 and 27-19-314, a court having considered the
20 pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
21 injunction, permanent injunction, vacatur, or other equitable relief may not enjoin, void, nullify, revoke, modify,
22 or suspend the issuance or effectiveness of a license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant
23 to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not
24 to prevail on the merits of its complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in
25 the absence of a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, vacatur, or other
26 equitable relief, that the:
27 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
28 (B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – HB 270
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 270.1
1 the public interest, a court:
2 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
3 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
4 findings with respect to both.
5 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
6 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
7 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
8 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
9 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
10 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
11 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
12 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
13 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
14 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking
15 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
16 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
17 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
18 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
19 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
20 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
21 and an An injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
22 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
23 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
24 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
25 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
26 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
27 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
28 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.

12 "75-1-102. Intent -- purpose. (1) The legislature, mindful of its constitutional obligations under Article
13 II, section 3, and Article IX of the Montana constitution, has enacted the Montana Environmental Policy Act. The
14 Montana Environmental Policy Act is procedural, and it is the legislature's intent that the requirements of parts 1
15 through 3 of this chapter provide for the adequate review of state actions in order to ensure that:
16 (a) environmental attributes are fully considered by the legislature in enacting laws to fulfill
17 constitutional obligations; and
18 (b) the public is informed of the anticipated impacts in Montana of potential state actions.
19 (2) The purpose of parts 1 through 3 of this chapter is to declare a state policy that will encourage
20 productive and enjoyable harmony between humans and their environment, to protect the right to use and enjoy
21 private property free of undue government regulation, to promote efforts that will prevent, mitigate, or eliminate
22 damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of humans, to enrich the
23 understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the state, and to establish an
24 environmental quality council.
25 (3) (a) The purpose of requiring an environmental assessment and an environmental impact
26 statement under part 2 of this chapter is to assist the legislature in determining whether laws are adequate to
27 address impacts to Montana's environment and to inform the public and public officials of potential impacts
28 resulting from decisions made by state agencies.

1 (b) Except to the extent that an applicant agrees to the incorporation of measures in a permit
2 pursuant to 75-1-201(4)(b) 75-1-201(3)(b), it is not the purpose of parts 1 through 3 of this chapter to provide for
3 regulatory authority, beyond authority explicitly provided for in existing statute, to a state agency.

5 Section 2. Section 75-1-201, MCA, is amended to read:
6 "75-1-201. General directions -- environmental impact statements. (1) The legislature authorizes
7 and directs that, to the fullest extent possible:
8 (a) the policies, regulations, and laws of the state must be interpreted and administered in
9 accordance with the policies set forth in parts 1 through 3;
10 (b) under this part, all agencies of the state, except the legislature and except as provided in
11 subsections subsection (2) and (3), shall:
12 (i) use a systematic, interdisciplinary approach that will ensure:
13 (A) the integrated use of the natural and social sciences and the environmental design arts in
14 planning and in decisionmaking for a state-sponsored project that may have an impact on the Montana human
15 environment by projects in Montana; and
16 (B) that in any environmental review that is not subject to subsection (1)(b)(iv), when an agency
17 considers alternatives, the alternative analysis will be in compliance with the provisions of subsections
18 (1)(b)(iv)(C)(I) and (1)(b)(iv)(C)(II) and, if requested by the project sponsor or if determined by the agency to be
19 necessary, subsection (1)(b)(iv)(C)(III);
20 (ii) identify and develop methods and procedures that will ensure that presently unquantified
21 environmental amenities and values may be given appropriate consideration in decisionmaking for state-
22 sponsored projects, along with economic and technical considerations;
23 (iii) identify and develop methods and procedures that will ensure that state government actions
24 that may impact the human environment in Montana are evaluated for regulatory restrictions on private
25 property, as provided in subsection (1)(b)(iv)(D);
26 (iv) include in each recommendation or report on proposals for projects, programs, and other major
27 actions of state government significantly affecting the quality of the human environment in Montana a detailed
28 statement on:

69th Legislature 2025 HB 270.1
1 (A) the environmental impact of the proposed action;
2 (B) any adverse effects on Montana's environment that cannot be avoided if the proposal is
3 implemented;
4 (C) alternatives to the proposed action. An analysis of any alternative included in the environmental
5 review must comply with the following criteria:
6 (I) any alternative proposed must be reasonable, in that the alternative must be achievable under
7 current technology and the alternative must be economically feasible as determined solely by the economic
8 viability for similar projects having similar conditions and physical locations and determined without regard to
9 the economic strength of the specific project sponsor;
10 (II) the agency proposing the alternative shall consult with the project sponsor regarding any
11 proposed alternative, and the agency shall give due weight and consideration to the project sponsor's
12 comments regarding the proposed alternative;
13 (III) the agency shall complete a meaningful no-action alternative analysis. The no-action
14 alternative analysis must include the projected beneficial and adverse environmental, social, and economic
15 impact of the project's noncompletion.
16 (D) any regulatory impacts on private property rights, including whether alternatives that reduce,
17 minimize, or eliminate the regulation of private property rights have been analyzed. The analysis in this
18 subsection (1)(b)(iv)(D) need not be prepared if the proposed action does not involve the regulation of private
19 property.
20 (E) the relationship between local short-term uses of the Montana human environment and the
21 maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity;
22 (F) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources that would be involved in the
23 proposed action if it is implemented;
24 (G) the customer fiscal impact analysis, if required by 69-2-216; and
25 (H) the details of the beneficial aspects of the proposed project, both short-term and long-term, and
26 the economic advantages and disadvantages of the proposal;
27 (v) in accordance with the criteria set forth in subsection (1)(b)(iv)(C), study, develop, and describe
28 appropriate alternatives to recommend courses of action in any proposal that involves unresolved conflicts

69th Legislature 2025 HB 270.1
1 concerning alternative uses of available resources. If the alternatives analysis is conducted for a project that is
2 not a state-sponsored project and alternatives are recommended, the project sponsor may volunteer to
3 implement the alternative. Neither the alternatives analysis nor the resulting recommendations bind the project
4 sponsor to take a recommended course of action, but the project sponsor may agree pursuant to subsection
5 (4)(b) (3)(b) to a specific course of action.
6 (vi) recognize the potential long-range character of environmental impacts in Montana and, when
7 consistent with the policies of the state, lend appropriate support to initiatives, resolutions, and programs
8 designed to maximize cooperation in anticipating and preventing a decline in the quality of Montana's
9 environment;
10 (vii) make available to counties, municipalities, institutions, and individuals advice and information
11 useful in restoring, maintaining, and enhancing the quality of Montana's environment;
12 (viii) initiate and use ecological information in the planning and development of resource-oriented
13 projects; and
14 (ix) assist the legislature and the environmental quality council established by 5-16-101;
15 (c) prior to making any detailed statement as provided in subsection (1)(b)(iv), the responsible
16 state official shall consult with and obtain the comments of any state agency that has jurisdiction by law or
17 special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved in Montana and with any Montana local
18 government, as defined in 7-12-1103, that may be directly impacted by the project. The responsible state
19 official shall also consult with and obtain comments from any state agency in Montana with respect to any
20 regulation of private property involved. Copies of the statement and the comments and views of the appropriate
21 state, federal, and local agencies that are authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards must be
22 made available to the governor, the environmental quality council, and the public and must accompany the
23 proposal through the existing agency review processes.
24 (d) a transfer of an ownership interest in a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for
25 use or permission to act by an agency, either singly or in combination with other state agencies, does not
26 trigger review under subsection (1)(b)(iv) if there is not a material change in terms or conditions of the
27 entitlement or unless otherwise provided by law.

13 developing measures that may, at the request of a project sponsor, be incorporated into a permit or other
14 authority to act.
15 (c) Parts 1 through 3 of this chapter do not confer authority to an agency that is a project sponsor
16 to modify a proposed project or action.

18 against a final agency action decision and may only be brought in district court or in federal court, whichever is
19 appropriate. A challenge may only be brought by a person who submits formal comments on the agency's
20 environmental review prior to the agency's final decision, and the challenge must be limited to those issues
21 addressed in those comments.
22 (ii) Any action or proceeding challenging a final agency action alleging failure to comply with or
23 inadequate compliance with a requirement under this part must be brought within 60 days of the action that is
24 the subject of the challenge.
25 (iii) For an action taken by the board of land commissioners or the department of natural resources
26 and conservation under Title 77, "final agency action" means the date that the board of land commissioners or

7 a claim that the environmental review is inadequate, the agency shall compile and submit to the court the
8 certified record of its decision at issue. The agency, prior to submitting the certified record to the court, shall
9 assess and collect from the person challenging the decision a fee to pay for actual costs to compile and submit

69th Legislature 2025 HB 270.1
1 agency's decision.
2 (b) (i) When a party challenging the decision or the adequacy of the environmental review or
3 decision presents information not in the record certified by the agency, the challenging party shall certify under
4 oath in an affidavit that the information is new, material, and significant evidence that was not publicly available
5 before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the decision or the adequacy of the agency's environmental
6 review.
7 (ii) If upon reviewing the affidavit the court finds that the proffered information is new, material, and
8 significant evidence that was not publicly available before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the
9 decision or to the adequacy of the agency's environmental review, the court shall remand the new evidence to
10 the agency for the agency's consideration and an opportunity to modify its decision or environmental review
11 before the court considers the evidence as a part of the administrative record under review.
12 (iii) If the court finds that the information in the affidavit does not meet the requirements of
13 subsection (6)(b)(i) (5)(b)(i), the court may not remand the matter to the agency or consider the proffered
14 information in making its decision.

16 or the adequacy of the statement are exclusive.
17 (ii) If the court finds that noncompliance has occurred with parts 1 through 3 of this chapter, the

19 (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-19-201 and 27-19-314, a court having considered the
20 pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
21 injunction, permanent injunction, vacatur, or other equitable relief may not enjoin, void, nullify, revoke, modify,
22 or suspend the issuance or effectiveness of a license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant
23 to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not
24 to prevail on the merits of its complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in
25 the absence of a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, vacatur, or other
26 equitable relief, that the:
27 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
28 (B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in

69th Legislature 2025 HB 270.1
1 the public interest, a court:
2 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
3 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
4 findings with respect to both.
5 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
6 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
7 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
8 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
9 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
10 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
11 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
12 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
13 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
14 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking
15 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
16 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
17 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
18 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
19 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
20 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
21 and an An injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
22 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
23 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
24 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
25 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
26 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
27 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
28 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
