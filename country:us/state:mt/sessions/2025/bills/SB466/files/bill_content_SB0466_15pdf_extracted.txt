69th Legislature 2025 SB 466.1
2 INTRODUCED BY D. LENZ
3
4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT ESTABLISHING FACTORS THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED
5 WHEN DETERMINING THE BEST INTERESTS OF A CHILD.”
6
7 WHEREAS, children and minors are too often an afterthought in policymaking even though every
8 aspect of government policy impacts kids, from health care to transportation. The government has no way to
9 evaluate whether policies would be good or bad for children, and no unified standard to use for that evaluation;
10 and
11 WHEREAS, due to the age of children and minors and their dependency, maturity, and lack of
12 mechanisms to make the case for their own interests and needs, children depend on adults in society and
13 government to support their health and well-being; and
14 WHEREAS, without a clear mandate to consider their needs, children will continue to be disregarded in
15 policy decisions that impact their lives and well-being; and
16 WHEREAS, a "best interests of the child" standard is the priority of policymaking that creates a
17 benchmark through which all policies can be evaluated and would make positive outcomes for children.

17 custodial arrangement is not in the best interests of the child;
