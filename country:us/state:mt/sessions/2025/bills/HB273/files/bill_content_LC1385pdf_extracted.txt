69th Legislature 2025 LC 1385

4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT LIMITING COLLECTION ACTIONS FOR A PATIENT'S DEBT
5 OWED FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES; REQUIRING A WAIT TIME AND NOTICE BEFORE ENGAGING IN
6 AN EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION ACTION; PROHIBITING CERTAIN COLLECTION ACTIONS; LIMITING
7 COLLECTION ACTIONS WHEN A HEALTH INSURANCE DECISION IS APPEALED; PROVIDING
8 DEFINITIONS; AMENDING SECTION 25-13-609, MCA; AND PROVIDING AN APPLICABILITY DATE.”

10 WHEREAS, rising health care costs have made medical debt a significant problem for working
11 Montanans, with one in three Americans burdened with medical debt; and
12 WHEREAS, increasing delay and denial of insurance claims, as well as increasing uncovered out-of-
13 pocket costs, have left patients who thought they had adequate insurance coverage without coverage for
14 particular circumstances, resulting in debt to cover the uninsured expenses; and
15 WHEREAS, medical debt incurred for necessary medical treatment is unlike other debt because it
16 usually results from an emergency caused by an unexpected sickness or accident and the debtor has little
17 choice but to incur the debt; and
18 WHEREAS, in 2022, 10% of Montanans had medical debt sent to collections, with the median debt in
19 collections being $713, forcing Montana families to choose between paying rent, buying groceries, or skipping
20 medical care; and
21 WHEREAS, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently found that longstanding
22 policies in Indian Health Services have resulted in people in Native American majority communities, due to no
23 fault of their own, being twice as likely to have medical debt in collections compared to the national average and
24 in significantly higher amounts; and
25 WHEREAS, medical debt can push patients to make hard choices that often harm their physical and
26 emotional health; and
27 WHEREAS, despite good faith efforts by some Montana health care providers to assist their patients
28 with unforeseen debt through charity and other programs, many Montanans refrain from getting needed

1 medical treatment because they cannot afford it, and reducing the burden of medical debt allows patients to
2 focus on their health instead of worrying about losing their homes or cars or negatively affecting their well-
3 being; and
4 WHEREFORE, the Legislature enacts the "Montana Medical Debt Patient Protection Act" to provide
5 important protections for patients by eliminating wage garnishment to pay medical debt, creating a waiting
6 period before medical bills can be sent to collections, providing patients with the opportunity to appeal
7 insurance decisions before a bill goes to collections, and protecting bank accounts from being seized to pay
8 medical debt.
