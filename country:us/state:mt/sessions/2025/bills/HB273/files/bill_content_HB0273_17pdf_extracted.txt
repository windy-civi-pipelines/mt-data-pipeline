8 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT LIMITING COLLECTION ACTIONS FOR A PATIENT'S DEBT
9 OWED FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES; REQUIRING A WAIT TIME AND NOTICE BEFORE ENGAGING IN
10 AN EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION ACTION; PROHIBITING CERTAIN COLLECTION ACTIONS; LIMITING
11 COLLECTION ACTIONS WHEN A HEALTH INSURANCE DECISION IS APPEALED; PROVIDING
12 DEFINITIONS; AMENDING SECTION 25-13-609, MCA; AND PROVIDING AN APPLICABILITY DATE.”
13
14 WHEREAS, rising health care costs have made medical debt a significant problem for working
15 Montanans, with one in three Americans burdened with medical debt; and
16 WHEREAS, increasing delay and denial of insurance claims, as well as increasing uncovered out-of-
17 pocket costs, have left patients who thought they had adequate insurance coverage without coverage for
18 particular circumstances, resulting in debt to cover the uninsured expenses; and
19 WHEREAS, medical debt incurred for necessary medical treatment is unlike other debt because it
20 usually results from an emergency caused by an unexpected sickness or accident and the debtor has little
21 choice but to incur the debt; and
22 WHEREAS, in 2022, 10% of Montanans had medical debt sent to collections, with the median debt in
23 collections being $713, forcing Montana families to choose between paying rent, buying groceries, or skipping
24 medical care; and
25 WHEREAS, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently found that longstanding
26 policies in Indian Health Services have resulted in people in Native American majority communities, due to no
27 fault of their own, being twice as likely to have medical debt in collections compared to the national average and
28 in significantly higher amounts; and
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – HB 273
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 273.1
1 WHEREAS, medical debt can push patients to make hard choices that often harm their physical and
2 emotional health; and
3 WHEREAS, despite good faith efforts by some Montana health care providers to assist their patients
4 with unforeseen debt through charity and other programs, many Montanans refrain from getting needed
5 medical treatment because they cannot afford it, and reducing the burden of medical debt allows patients to
6 focus on their health instead of worrying about losing their homes or cars or negatively affecting their well-
7 being; and
8 WHEREFORE, the Legislature enacts the "Montana Medical Debt Patient Protection Act" to provide
9 important protections for patients by eliminating wage garnishment to pay medical debt, creating a waiting
10 period before medical bills can be sent to collections, providing patients with the opportunity to appeal
11 insurance decisions before a bill goes to collections, and protecting bank accounts from being seized to pay
12 medical debt.
13
