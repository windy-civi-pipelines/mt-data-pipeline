Governor of the State of Montana

Rights
Dear Governor Gianforte:
On behalf of the Fort Belknap Indian Community — the Gros Ventre and Assiniboine Peoples
— I write to respectfully urge you to veto HB 952.
Although HB 952 is presented as an opportunity for tribal-state cooperation in the regulation of
cannabis, it was drafted and advanced without meaningful consultation with our government or
other tribal governments in Montana. Further, its provisions undermine the sovereign rights of
the Fort Belknap Indian Community and all Tribal Nations by:
• Conditioning the exercise of tribal regulatory authority on state approval,
• Mandating state control over cannabis licensing and revenue sharing, and
• Imposing frameworks that treat tribes as subordinate entities rather than equal sovereign
governments.
The Fort Belknap Indian Community has the inherent sovereign right to regulate commerce,
taxation, licensing, and health and safety standards within our own lands — rights recognized by
the U.S. Constitution, treaties, federal statutes, and Supreme Court precedent.
HB 952 fails to respect these rights, instead creating a system in which tribes must operate within
a state-imposed framework, effectively eroding our jurisdiction and self-determination.
Additionally, HB 952 was developed and passed without the free, prior, and informed consent of
tribal governments, violating fundamental principles of tribal consultation that the State of
Montana has previously pledged to honor.
We are not opposed to collaboration.
We believe tribal-state compacts regarding cannabis, gaming, taxation, and other issues must be
negotiated on a government-to-government basis, with voluntary participation and respect for
tribal sovereignty at the forefront.
HB 952 does not meet that standard.
Accordingly, we respectfully request that you veto HB 952.
Instead, we urge the State of Montana to open a meaningful dialogue with the sovereign Nations
within its borders to build true partnerships that reflect mutual respect, equality, and shared
goals.
We stand ready to engage in such discussions at your earliest opportunity.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
Sincerely,
Jeffrey Stiffarm, President
