22 including the total anticipated cost of operation and maintenance activities.
23 (6) The department may exempt any portion of a remedial action that is conducted entirely on site
24 from a state or local permit that would, in the absence of the remedial action, be required if the remedial action
25 is carried out in accordance with the standards established under this section and this part.
26 (7) The department may require financial assurance from a liable person in an amount that the
27 department determines will ensure the long-term operation and maintenance of the remedial action site. The
