CONFORMITY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS
As required pursuant to section 5-11-112(1)(c), MCA, it is the Legislative Services Division's
statutory responsibility to conduct "legal review of draft bills". The comments noted below
regarding conformity with state and federal constitutions are provided to assist the Legislature
in making its own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill. The comments are based
on an analysis of jurisdictionally relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the
bill. The comments are not written for the purpose of influencing whether the bill should
become law but are written to provide information relevant to the Legislature's consideration
of this bill. The comments are not a formal legal opinion and are not a substitute for the
judgment of the judiciary, which has the authority to determine the constitutionality of a law
in the context of a specific case.
This review is intended to inform the bill draft requestor of potential constitutional conformity
issues that may be raised by the bill as drafted. This review IS NOT dispositive of the issue of
constitutional conformity and the general rule as repeatedly stated by the Montana Supreme
Court is that an enactment of the Legislature is presumed to be constitutional unless it is
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the enactment is unconstitutional. See Alexander v.
Bozeman Motors, Inc., 356 Mont. 439, 234 P.3d 880 (2010); Eklund v. Wheatland County,
351 Mont. 370, 212 P.3d 297 (2009); St. v. Pyette, 337 Mont. 265, 159 P.3d 232 (2007); and
Elliott v. Dept. of Revenue, 334 Mont. 195, 146 P.3d 741 (2006).
Legal Reviewer Comments:
As drafted, Section 1 of HB 368 requires that:
(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2), the owner of a coal-fired generating unit
shall provide the water supply for residential and commercial use of the city or town in which it
is located to ensure an adequate water supply is available if a coal-fired generating unit closes
or retires, potentially jeopardizing access to a water supply.
(2) If the operator of a coal-fired generating unit owns, operates, or both owns and
operates a conveyance necessary to maintain a public water supply system, as defined in 75-6-
102, that operator shall provide operation of the conveyance and access to the necessary water
supply until contamination from the facility or its impoundments meets the department's cleanup
criteria at the point of compliance pursuant to Title 75, chapter 20. (Emphasis added).

Section 2:
Section 7-13-4405, MCA imposes specific requirements on a city or town's acquisition:
7-13-4405. Acquisition of water rights and other necessary property.
For the purpose of providing the city or town with an adequate water supply for
municipal and domestic purposes, the city or town council shall procure
appropriate water rights and the necessary real and personal property to make an
adequate water supply available. The water rights and property may be acquired
by purchase, appropriation, location, condemnation pursuant to Title 70, chapter
30, or in any other legal manner. (Emphasis added).
Pursuant to 7-13-4404, MCA, if an agreement is not reached for the acquisition of a private
water supply system, the city or town is required to use its eminent domain powers to acquire a
water supply system, including water rights. The Montana Supreme Court has stated that:
"Mont. Code Ann. § 7-13-4404 provides that a city shall proceed to acquire the
plant or water supply under the laws relating to the taking of private property for
public use. Mont. Code Ann. § 70-30-111 sets forth the standard of proof and the
facts which must be found before private property may be taken for a public use
and provides that before property can be taken, the plaintiff must show by a
preponderance of the evidence that the public interest requires the taking based on
the following findings: (1) that the use to which it is to be applied is a use
authorized by law; (2) that the taking is necessary to such use; (3) if already
appropriated to some public use, that the public use to which it is to be applied is
a more necessary public use; and (4) that an effort to obtain the interest sought to
be condemned was made by submission of a written offer and that such offer was
rejected"
Missoula v. Mountain Water Co., 228 Mont. 404, 743 P.2d 590 (1987).
HB 368 may raise potential constitutional issues associated with Article II, section 29, of the
Montana Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Article II, section 29,
provides in part: “Private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just
compensation to the full extent of the loss having been first made to or paid into court for the
owner.” The Fifth Amendment provides that property shall not “be taken for public use without
just compensation.” The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution applies to the states through
the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Article II, section 29, and the Fifth Amendment do not prohibit the government from interfering
with private property. Rather, these provisions restrict the government’s power to physically
appropriate or condemn private property. The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that the takings
clause is “designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens,
which in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.” Armstrong v. United
States, 364 U.S. 40, 80 S. Ct. 1563 (1960).
The courts have established several rules for determining whether an interference with property
constitutes a taking. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that a permanent physical
occupation of property by a government constitutes a taking. See Loretto v. Teleprompter
Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 102 S. Ct. 3164 (1982). In addition, a governmental
regulation that deprives a property owner of all economically beneficial use of the property also
constitutes a taking. Lucas v. South Carolina Costal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 112 S. Ct. 2886
(1992). Outside of these categorical rules, courts will apply a case-specific analysis to determine
whether a taking has occurred. Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 98 S.
Ct. 2646 (1978). Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a temporary physical invasion may
constitute a taking for purposes of the Fifth Amendment. See Arkansas Game and Fish Comm. v.
United States, 133 S. Ct. 511, 518 (2012).
Pursuant to Article IX, section 3, of the Montana Constitution, title to the water always remains
with the state of Montana, but all existing rights to use any water for any useful or beneficial use
are constitutionally recognized and confirmed and the use of state waters not previously claimed
may be established and appropriated through the permitting process provided for in Title 85,
chapter 2, MCA.
It is well settled that water rights are legally protected property rights. As the Montana Supreme
Court explained in 1936, when a right has been fully perfected by diverting the water and
applying it to a beneficial purpose, the right becomes a property right that can "only be divested
in some legal manner". Osnes Livestock Co. v. Warren, 103 Mont. 284, 294, 62 P.2d 206, 210
(1936).
The recognition that a water right is a form of real property came early in Montana’s history.
For example, in Sain v. Montana Power, 20 F. Supp. 843 (D. Mont. 1937), the Court found that
water rights were a form of real property and, further, that suits to adjudicate the extent and
priority of water rights were similar to quiet title actions. This principle was also recognized in a
1924 decision from the Montana Supreme Court, in which the Court stated that "[a]n action to
ascertain, determine and decree the extent and priority of the right to use of water partakes of the
nature of an action to quiet title to real estate." See Verwolf v. Low Line Irrigation Co., 70 Mont.
570, 227 P. 68 (1924).
The substantive nature of a water right as a form of real property is also illustrated by the
Montana Supreme Court’s recognition that water rights may be acquired through adverse
possession or prescription. Adverse possession is a method of acquisition of title to property by
possession for a statutory period under certain conditions. A claim for adverse possession
requires proof of open, notorious, exclusive, adverse, and continuous possession or use of the
property for the statutory period of 5 years. See Shors v. Branch, 221 Mont. 390, 720 P.2d 239
(1986).
As drafted, HB 368 requires that an operator of a coal-fired generating unit to provide operation
of the conveyance and access to the necessary water rights to a city or town until contamination
from the facility or its impoundments meets the department's cleanup criteria and without the
city or town purchasing or condemning the water rights. Section 7-13-4405, MCA requires that
for the purposes of providing a city or town with an adequate water supply, water rights and
property may be acquired by purchase, appropriation, location, condemnation pursuant to Title
70, chapter 30, or in any other legal manner.
The government requiring an owner of water rights to provide operation and conveyance and
access to the owner's water rights until contamination from the facility or its impoundments
meets the department's cleanup criteria, which may very well be decades, without compensation
by the government or the government condemning those water rights and providing
compensation, may raise potential constitutional conformity issues associated with Article II,

Section 3:
section 29, of the Montana Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
