CONFORMITY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS
As required pursuant to section 5-11-112(1)(c), MCA, it is the Legislative Services Division's
statutory responsibility to conduct "legal review of draft bills". The comments noted below
regarding conformity with state and federal constitutions are provided to assist the Legislature
in making its own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill. The comments are based
on an analysis of jurisdictionally relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the
bill. The comments are not written for the purpose of influencing whether the bill should
become law but are written to provide information relevant to the Legislature's consideration
of this bill. The comments are not a formal legal opinion and are not a substitute for the
judgment of the judiciary, which has the authority to determine the constitutionality of a law
in the context of a specific case.
This review is intended to inform the bill draft requestor of potential constitutional conformity
issues that may be raised by the bill as drafted. This review IS NOT dispositive of the issue of
constitutional conformity and the general rule as repeatedly stated by the Montana Supreme
Court is that an enactment of the Legislature is presumed to be constitutional unless it is
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the enactment is unconstitutional. See Alexander v.
Bozeman Motors, Inc., 356 Mont. 439, 234 P.3d 880 (2010); Eklund v. Wheatland County,
351 Mont. 370, 212 P.3d 297 (2009); St. v. Pyette, 337 Mont. 265, 159 P.3d 232 (2007); and
Elliott v. Dept. of Revenue, 334 Mont. 195, 146 P.3d 741 (2006).
Legal Reviewer Comments:
SB 193 amends section 37-61-102, which currently provides:
37-61-102. Attorneys' examining board — appointment, quorum, and powers. (1)
The supreme court shall appoint members of the bar of this state, in good standing, as an
examining board to conduct and assist in conducting the examination of applicants for
admission to the bar. The board may not exceed seven members. The court may release,
dismiss, or remove any member of the board and appoint other members at any time.
(2) A majority of the board is a quorum and may conduct examinations.
(3) The board shall perform the duties and render assistance in the examinations
of applicants as prescribed by the court and is governed and controlled by the rules that
the court may prescribe.
(Emphasis added).SB 193, as drafted, removes the authority of the supreme court to “appoint
members of the bar of this state, in good standing, as an examining board to conduct and assist in
conducting the examination of applicants for admission to the bar” and places that authority with
the governor.
SB 193 also removes the Supreme Court’s authority to “release, dismiss, or remove any member
of the [examining] board and appoint other members at any time” and places that authority with
the governor.
Lastly, SB 193 provides that the “[examining] board shall perform the duties and render
assistance in the examinations of applicants as prescribed” by the governor instead of the
Supreme Court.
SB 193, as drafted, may raise a potential separation of powers issue to the extent it prohibits the
Supreme Court from making and then enforcing rules regarding the admission of members of the
bar. Specifically, this raises a potential conflict with Article VII, section 2(3) of the Montana
Constitution, which provides:

Section 2:
Section 2. Supreme court jurisdiction. (1) The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction
and may issue, hear, and determine writs appropriate thereto. It has original jurisdiction
to issue, hear, and determine writs of habeas corpus and such other writs as may be
provided by law.
(2) It has general supervisory control over all other courts.
(3) It may make rules governing appellate procedure, practice and procedure for all other
courts, admission to the bar and the conduct of its members. Rules of procedure shall be
subject to disapproval by the legislature in either of the two sessions following
promulgation.
(4) Supreme court process shall extend to all parts of the state.
(Emphasis added). The separation of powers clause of the Montana Constitution at Article III,

Section 3:
section 1, provides:
Separation of powers. The power of the government of this state is divided into
three distinct branches--legislative, executive, and judicial. No person or persons
charged with the exercise of power properly belonging to one branch shall
exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except as in this
constitution expressly directed or permitted.
