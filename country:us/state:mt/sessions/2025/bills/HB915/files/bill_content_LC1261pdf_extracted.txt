1 optic or coaxial cable was placed in service, after which the property exemption is phased out at a rate of 20%
2 a year, with the property being assessed at 100% of its taxable value after a 10-year period. In order to
3 maintain the exemption, the owner of fiber optic or coaxial cable shall reinvest the tax savings from the
4 exemption by installing and placing in service new fiber optic or coaxial cable in Montana within 2 years from
5 the date the owner first claimed the exemption provided for in this subsection (4)(b) without charging those
6 costs to the consumer. The cost of installing or placing into service fiber optic or coaxial cable with the
7 reinvested tax savings without charging those costs to the consumer must be equal to or greater than the value
8 of the tax savings received from the tax incentive.
9 (ii) Fiber optic or coaxial cable installed using federal funds received pursuant to Section 9901 of
10 the American Rescue Plan Act is not eligible for exemption from taxation under this section.
11 (iii) An entity that claims a tax exemption under this subsection (4)(b) shall maintain adequate
12 books and records demonstrating the investment the owner made when installing and placing in service fiber
13 optic or coaxial cable in Montana. The property owners shall make those records available to the department
14 for inspection upon request.
15 (5) (a) The property taxes exempted from taxation by subsection (4)(b) are subject to termination
16 or recapture if the department determines that the owner failed to install and place in service new coaxial or
17 fiber cable in Montana as provided in subsection (4)(b) or otherwise violates the provisions of this section.
18 (b) Upon notice from the department that the owner's exemption has terminated, any local
19 governing body may recapture taxes previously exempted in that jurisdiction, plus interest and penalties for
20 nonpayment of property taxes as provided in 15-16-102, during any tax year in which an exemption under the
21 provisions of this section was improper. Any recapture must occur within 10 years after the end of the calendar
22 year in which the exemption was first claimed.
23 (c) The recapture of abated taxes may be cancelled, in whole or in part, if the local governing body
24 determines that the taxpayer's failure to meet the requirements is a result of circumstances beyond the control
