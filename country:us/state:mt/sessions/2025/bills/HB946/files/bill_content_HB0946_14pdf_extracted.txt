1 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice
2 must be provided that the taxpayer will be given a form to acknowledge confidentiality requirements for the
3 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
4 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
5 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
6 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
7 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
8 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate
9 appraisers and the appraisal was completed within 6 months of the valuation date pursuant to 15-8-201. If the
10 department does not use the appraisal provided by the taxpayer in conducting the appeal, the department shall
11 provide to the taxpayer the reason for not using the appraisal. The department shall give reasonable notice to
12 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
13 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
14 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
15 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
16 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
17 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
18 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
19 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
20 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
21 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
22 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
23 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
24 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
25 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
26 for making the adjustment.
27 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
28 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or

2 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
3 office hours.
4 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
5 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
6 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
7 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
8 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
9 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
10 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
11 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
12 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
13 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
14 accordance with the board's order."

17 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
18 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
19 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
20 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
21 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
22 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
23 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
24 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
25 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
26 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
27 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
28 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average

3 labor.
4 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
5 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,

14 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
15 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
16 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
17 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
18 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
19 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
20 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
21 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
22 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
23 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
24 following tax year.
25 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
26 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
27 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.

8 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
9 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
10 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
11 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7); and
12 (c) may not include revenue distributed to a county to provide state property tax assistance
13 pursuant to [sections 2 and 5].

15 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
16 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
17 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
18 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.

3 receipt of all aggregate model output that the department used in the valuation model for the property.
4 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures
5 of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act. As a part of the review, the department may consider the actual
6 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
7 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
8 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate

12 the taxpayer of the time and place of the review.
13 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
14 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
15 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
16 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
17 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
18 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
19 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
20 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
21 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
22 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
23 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
24 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
25 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
26 for making the adjustment.

8 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
9 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
10 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
11 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
12 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
13 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
14 accordance with the board's order."

16 Section 11. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
17 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
18 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
19 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
20 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
21 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
22 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
23 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
24 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
25 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
26 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
27 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
28 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average

3 labor.
4 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
5 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
6 including newly taxable property.
7 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
8 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;

10 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
11 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
12 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
13 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
14 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
15 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
16 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
17 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
18 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
19 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
20 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
21 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
22 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
23 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
24 following tax year.
25 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
26 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
27 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.

8 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
9 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
10 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
11 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7); and
12 (c) may not include revenue distributed to a county to provide state property tax assistance
13 pursuant to [sections 2 and 5].

15 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
16 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
17 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
18 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
