14 trustee resolution. (1) An existing elementary district that is not part of a unified school system or governed by
15 a joint board with a high school district may expand into a K-12 district under the procedures outlined in this
16 section only if the elementary district's ANB, as calculated under the provisions of 20-9-311, is at least 1,000.
17 (2) The expansion to a K-12 district may be requested by the trustees of an existing elementary
18 district through passage of a resolution that includes the information outlined in 20-6-105(3) and requests the
19 county superintendent to order an election to allow the electors of the elementary district to consider the
20 proposition of expanding the elementary school district into a K-12 district. The trustees of an existing
21 elementary district with an ANB of at least 1,000 may not pass a resolution for expansion more than one time
22 within a 5-year period.
23 (3) (a) If the proposition for the expansion is approved by the electors of the elementary district and
24 the trustees issue a certificate of election as provided in 20-20-416, for a period of 2 years from the date of the
25 certification of the election the elementary trustees have the authority to propose to the electors of the
26 elementary district:

2 to accommodate high school students.
3 (b) The bond limitations pursuant to 20-9-406 imposed on a district proposing a bond under
4 subsection (3)(a) must be calculated on the limits for a K-12 district with the high school ANB calculated by
5 dividing the ANB of the elementary district by 9 and multiplying the result by 4.
6 (c) A bond approved under subsection (3)(a) becomes a bond of, and may not be issued until the
7 creation of, the K-12 district formed pursuant to subsection (4).
8 (d) A district that issues a bond under this subsection (3) is eligible for facility reimbursements and
9 advances pursuant to 20-9-366 through 20-9-371 that, until the new high school has enrolled students in all
10 grades and has established an actual ANB for budgeting purposes, must be based on an estimated high school
11 ANB calculated by dividing the ANB of the elementary district by 9 and multiplying the result by 4.
12 (e) Until the county superintendent orders the creation of a new high school district and attachment
13 of the expanding elementary district to form a new K-12 district pursuant to subsection (4), the existing high
14 school district remains intact for all purposes.

16 approval of the bond the county superintendent shall order the creation of a new high school district with
17 identical boundaries to the expanding elementary district and the immediate attachment of the expanding
18 elementary district to form a K-12 district. The county superintendent shall send a copy of the order to the board
19 of county commissioners and to the trustees of the districts affected by the creation of the district. The trustees
20 of the expanding elementary district must be designated as the trustees of the new K-12 district.

22 high school grade, the K-12 trustees shall prepare operating budgets for the new high school according to the
23 school budgeting provisions of this title, except that:
24 (a) the ANB for any inaugural grades for the high school program of the K-12 district must be
25 estimated by the trustees and may not exceed the number resulting from dividing the highest budgeted ANB of
26 the elementary program in the preceding 3 fiscal years by 9 and multiplying the result by the number of grades
27 in which the high school will enroll students for the first time in the ensuing school year;
28 (b) the number of quality educators for the high school program must be estimated by the trustees
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 252

3 the K-12 district must be based on the taxable value as most recently determined by the department of

6 the total quality educator and qualified staff payment, and the budget components derived from ANB counts;

9 adopted by the trustees for the upcoming school year.

17 (c) the K-12 district shall pay the high school district 20% of the per-ANB maximum rate
18 established in 20-9-306 for each of its students enrolled in the high school district with one-half of the amount
19 due by December 31 of the year following the year of attendance and the remainder due no later than June 15

11 the K-12 district. The debt service on the bonds must be allocated to the elementary program of the K-12
12 district.
13 (e) Bonded indebtedness of the high school district or the K-12 district that is subsequently
14 affected by a later reorganization of the high school district or the K-12 district is governed by the provisions of
15 Title 20, chapter 6, part 4.
16 (8) When a K-8 district expands to a K-12 district as provided for in this section, a principal,
17 teacher, or other certified employee of the original high school district who has a right of tenure under Montana
18 law must be given preference in hiring for a vacant position in the new K-12 district for which the employee is

20 chapter 5, part 3;
21 (4) A public charter school district is prohibited from charging tuition and fees.

5 school and to expend or use the gifts or donations in accordance with the conditions prescribed by the donor. A
6 gift or donation may not be accepted if the gift or donation is subject to a condition that is contrary to any
7 provision of law or term of the charter contract.
8 (9) Money received by a public charter school from any source and remaining in the public charter

5 dividing the ANB of the elementary district by 9 and multiplying the result by 4.
6 (c) A bond approved under subsection (3)(a) becomes a bond of, and may not be issued until the
7 creation of, the K-12 district formed pursuant to subsection (4).

26 the elementary program in the preceding 3 fiscal years by 9 and multiplying the result by the number of grades
27 in which the high school will enroll students for the first time in the ensuing school year;
28 (b) the number of quality educators for the high school program must be estimated by the trustees
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 252

12 district.
13 (e) Bonded indebtedness of the high school district or the K-12 district that is subsequently
14 affected by a later reorganization of the high school district or the K-12 district is governed by the provisions of
15 Title 20, chapter 6, part 4.

10 under this subsection (2)(b) is both the minimum amount and the maximum amount of public funding for the
11 public charter school district.
12 (c) A public charter school district is not eligible for a basic entitlement unless its ANB is greater
13 than:
14 (i) 70 for an elementary school or program;

20 public instruction an annually updated list of the criteria of courses of study, including any completion or
