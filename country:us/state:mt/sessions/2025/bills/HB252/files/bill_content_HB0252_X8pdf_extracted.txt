trustee resolution. (1) An existing elementary district that is not part of a unified school system or governed by
a joint board with a high school district may expand into a K-12 district under the procedures outlined in this

Section 4:
section only if the elementary district's ANB, as calculated under the provisions of 20-9-311, is at least 1,000.
(2) The expansion to a K-12 district may be requested by the trustees of an existing elementary
district through passage of a resolution that includes the information outlined in 20-6-105(3) and requests the
county superintendent to order an election to allow the electors of the elementary district to consider the
proposition of expanding the elementary school district into a K-12 district. The trustees of an existing
elementary district with an ANB of at least 1,000 may not pass a resolution for expansion more than one time
within a 5-year period.
(3) (a) If the proposition for the expansion is approved by the electors of the elementary district and
the trustees issue a certificate of election as provided in 20-20-416, for a period of 2 years from the date of the
certification of the election the elementary trustees have the authority to propose to the electors of the
elementary district:
(i) a transition costs levy pursuant to 20-9-502; and

altering, repairing, buying, furnishing, equipping, purchasing lands for, or obtaining a water supply for a school
to accommodate high school students.
(b) The bond limitations pursuant to 20-9-406 imposed on a district proposing a bond under
subsection (3)(a) must be calculated on the limits for a K-12 district with the high school ANB calculated by
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – HB 252
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 252
dividing the ANB of the elementary district by 9 and multiplying the result by 4.
(c) A bond approved under subsection (3)(a) becomes a bond of, and may not be issued until the
creation of, the K-12 district formed pursuant to subsection (4).
(d) A district that issues a bond under this subsection (3) is eligible for facility reimbursements and
advances pursuant to 20-9-366 through 20-9-371 that, until the new high school has enrolled students in all
grades and has established an actual ANB for budgeting purposes, must be based on an estimated high school
ANB calculated by dividing the ANB of the elementary district by 9 and multiplying the result by 4.
(e) Until the county superintendent orders the creation of a new high school district and attachment
of the expanding elementary district to form a new K-12 district pursuant to subsection (4), the existing high
school district remains intact for all purposes.
(4) If elementary electors approve a bond pursuant to subsection (3), on July 1 following the
approval of the bond the county superintendent shall order the creation of a new high school district with
identical boundaries to the expanding elementary district and the immediate attachment of the expanding
elementary district to form a K-12 district. The county superintendent shall send a copy of the order to the board
of county commissioners and to the trustees of the districts affected by the creation of the district. The trustees
of the expanding elementary district must be designated as the trustees of the new K-12 district.
(5) Prior to the first school fiscal year in which the K-12 district will enroll students in a particular
high school grade, the K-12 trustees shall prepare operating budgets for the new high school according to the
school budgeting provisions of this title, except that:
(a) the ANB for any inaugural grades for the high school program of the K-12 district must be
estimated by the trustees and may not exceed the number resulting from dividing the highest budgeted ANB of
the elementary program in the preceding 3 fiscal years by 9 and multiplying the result by the number of grades
in which the high school will enroll students for the first time in the ensuing school year;
(b) the number of quality educators for the high school program must be estimated by the trustees
and may not exceed the number resulting from dividing the ANB estimated under subsection (5)(a) by 10;

the K-12 district must be based on the taxable value as most recently determined by the department of
revenue;

of the year following the year of attendance. The K-12 trustees shall establish a tuition fund and levy to fund
these payments.

following the creation of the K-12 district is secured by the territory of the high school district as of the date of
issuance of the high school district bonds and must be paid by tax levies against the territory of the high school
district. However, if bonds of the high school district were approved at a bond election conducted before the
creation of the K-12 district, all bonds of the high school district issued by the high school district under the
bond election authority must remain secured by and be the indebtedness of the territory of the high school
district as of the date the bond authority was approved by voters and must be paid by tax levies against that

affected by a later reorganization of the high school district or the K-12 district is governed by the provisions of
Title 20, chapter 6, part 4.

school board, a public charter school must be considered a separate budget unit of the located school district,
must have its ANB calculated separately from other budget units of the district, and must receive a basic
entitlement calculated separately from other budget units of the district when its ANB is greater than:

funding or other assistance for the establishment or operation of a public charter school. The governing board
of a public charter school is authorized to accept gifts or donations of any kind made to the public charter

graduation rate for American Indians by 5 percentage points or more from the previous year as measured by
the office of public instruction, the multiplier in subsection (2)(a)(i) must be increased to 3.

the board or the board's designee, the requirements of subsection (2) for the funding in subsection (5) and the
flexibilities in subsection (6) until the annual appropriation is exhausted, after which further applications,
including first-time applications and annual reports requesting an expansion of a previously approved plan, are
to be deferred for consideration in a subsequent year, in the order of a lottery system draw, if and when
additional funds become available for distribution. The lottery system shall assign every first-time application or
request for expansion of a previously approved plan a number that will be placed into a lottery system draw that
will be done by a third party. The applications will be assigned a position in the order in which the numbers are
drawn. The drawing will continue until all districts are on the qualification list for the current year funding or
deferred for consideration in a subsequent year.
(b) require each participating school district to submit an annual report demonstrating, in the
determination of the board or the board's designee, continued qualification for funding under this section and
including a report of progress toward measurable objectives under the school district's transformational learning
plan. The school district shall include any decrease or requested increase in the number of participating full-
time equivalent educators under subsection (2)(a) for adjustments to its funding. Any increase in funding based
on requested increased levels of participation under subsection (2)(a) must be determined in the year in which
the request for a funding increase is received and augmented with a lottery system among all first-time
applications and annual reports requesting an expansion of a previously approved plan and must be contingent
on the availability of funds within any appropriation of the legislature. An application deferred for consideration
in a subsequent year due to lack of funding must be annually updated each year after more than 1 full fiscal
year has passed from the date of original submission of the application in order for the application to retain its
priority by original date received.
(c) report in accordance with 5-11-210 to the education interim committee on the progress made
by districts as submitted in the annual report and strategic plan operating under approved and funded
transformational learning plans.

are not considered expenditures to be applied against budget authority.
(b) Any transfers that are not expended for the purposes of implementing the district's approved
transformational learning plan within 2 full school fiscal years after the funds are transferred must be transferred
back to the originating fund from which the revenue was transferred.

of school districts without an increase in local taxes. In furtherance of this intent, if transfers of funds are made
from any school district fund supported by a nonvoted levy, the district may not increase its nonvoted levy for
the purpose of restoring the amount of funds transferred.

toward further credentialing;
(c) note the credit value available in 3-credit increments; and
(d) be applicable from the date of adoption until the date a new list is adopted. However, if a
credential or work-based learning experience is removed from the list, a high school student who is already
enrolled in a listed course may receive credit for the course through the end of the current school term.
(2) The department of labor and industry shall adopt a process to add recognition for credentials
and work-based learning experiences between list updates that are available to any student. The process must:
(a) be set forth in administrative rule, written to include factors for consideration of inclusion and
exclusion;

employee for the purposes of calculating the total quality educator and qualified staff payment provided in 20-9-
306 for each district participating in the joint employment of the individual.
(3) Joint employment for school districts qualifies is met if the districts employ the individual directly
or through the terms of a multidistrict agreement as provided in 20-3-363.

trustee resolution. (1) An existing elementary district that is not part of a unified school system or governed by
a joint board with a high school district may expand into a K-12 district under the procedures outlined in this
section only if the elementary district's ANB, as calculated under the provisions of 20-9-311, is at least 1,000.
(2) The expansion to a K-12 district may be requested by the trustees of an existing elementary
district through passage of a resolution that includes the information outlined in 20-6-105(3) and requests the
county superintendent to order an election to allow the electors of the elementary district to consider the
proposition of expanding the elementary school district into a K-12 district. The trustees of an existing
elementary district with an ANB of at least 1,000 may not pass a resolution for expansion more than one time
within a 5-year period.
(3) (a) If the proposition for the expansion is approved by the electors of the elementary district and
the trustees issue a certificate of election as provided in 20-20-416, for a period of 2 years from the date of the
certification of the election the elementary trustees have the authority to propose to the electors of the
elementary district:
(i) a transition costs levy pursuant to 20-9-502; and
(ii) a general obligation bond pursuant to Title 20, chapter 9, part 4, for the purpose of building,
altering, repairing, buying, furnishing, equipping, purchasing lands for, or obtaining a water supply for a school
to accommodate high school students.
(b) The bond limitations pursuant to 20-9-406 imposed on a district proposing a bond under

- 3 - Authorized Print Version – HB 252
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 252
dividing the ANB of the elementary district by 9 and multiplying the result by 4.
(c) A bond approved under subsection (3)(a) becomes a bond of, and may not be issued until the
creation of, the K-12 district formed pursuant to subsection (4).
(d) A district that issues a bond under this subsection (3) is eligible for facility reimbursements and
advances pursuant to 20-9-366 through 20-9-371 that, until the new high school has enrolled students in all
grades and has established an actual ANB for budgeting purposes, must be based on an estimated high school
ANB calculated by dividing the ANB of the elementary district by 9 and multiplying the result by 4.
(e) Until the county superintendent orders the creation of a new high school district and attachment
of the expanding elementary district to form a new K-12 district pursuant to subsection (4), the existing high
school district remains intact for all purposes.
(4) If elementary electors approve a bond pursuant to subsection (3), on July 1 following the
approval of the bond the county superintendent shall order the creation of a new high school district with
identical boundaries to the expanding elementary district and the immediate attachment of the expanding
elementary district to form a K-12 district. The county superintendent shall send a copy of the order to the board
of county commissioners and to the trustees of the districts affected by the creation of the district. The trustees
of the expanding elementary district must be designated as the trustees of the new K-12 district.
(5) Prior to the first school fiscal year in which the K-12 district will enroll students in a particular
high school grade, the K-12 trustees shall prepare operating budgets for the new high school according to the
school budgeting provisions of this title, except that:
(a) the ANB for any inaugural grades for the high school program of the K-12 district must be
estimated by the trustees and may not exceed the number resulting from dividing the highest budgeted ANB of
the elementary program in the preceding 3 fiscal years by 9 and multiplying the result by the number of grades
in which the high school will enroll students for the first time in the ensuing school year;
(b) the number of quality educators for the high school program must be estimated by the trustees
and may not exceed the number resulting from dividing the ANB estimated under subsection (5)(a) by 10;

following the creation of the K-12 district is secured by the territory of the high school district as of the date of
issuance of the high school district bonds and must be paid by tax levies against the territory of the high school
district. However, if bonds of the high school district were approved at a bond election conducted before the
creation of the K-12 district, all bonds of the high school district issued by the high school district under the
bond election authority must remain secured by and be the indebtedness of the territory of the high school
district as of the date the bond authority was approved by voters and must be paid by tax levies against that

affected by a later reorganization of the high school district or the K-12 district is governed by the provisions of
Title 20, chapter 6, part 4.
(8) When a K-8 district expands to a K-12 district as provided for in this section, a principal,
teacher, or other certified employee of the original high school district who has a right of tenure under Montana

amounts."
Section 14. Future ready payment -- purpose -- calculation -- definitions. (1) Beginning in fiscal

(3) (a) A high school graduate may reach goal levels 1 and 2 using any combination of
postsecondary and CTE-equivalent credits.
(b) A high school graduate who achieves a higher future ready goal level does not generate a
lower goal level payment.
(4) For the purposes of [section 15] and this section, the following definitions apply:
(a) "CTE-equivalent credit" means the career and technical education (CTE) credit value ascribed
by the department of labor and industry as set forth in [section 15].
(b) (i) "Postsecondary credit" means the successful completion of a course of study by a student

public instruction an annually updated list of the criteria of courses of study, including any completion or
examination requirements, that a high school student may take that result in eligibility for transcripted credit at
any unit of the Montana university system based on the adopted policies of the board of regents of higher
education. If the number of credits differs based on examination results, the list must include these
differentiated credit values. The list submitted applies to the achievements of high school graduates from the
prior school year.
Section 15. CTE-equivalent credit -- department of labor and industry -- rulemaking. (1)
Annually, but not later than December 1, the department of labor and industry shall adopt in rule a list of

(a) be developed, in part, with input from industry stakeholders, school districts, the office of public
instruction, and the office of the commissioner of higher education;
(b) include credentials, combinations of credentials, and work-based learning experiences that

lead to enhanced employment opportunities at higher rates of compensation and, when feasible, are stackable
toward further credentialing;
(c) note the credit value available in 3-credit increments; and
(d) be applicable from the date of adoption until the date a new list is adopted. However, if a
credential or work-based learning experience is removed from the list, a high school student who is already
enrolled in a listed course may receive credit for the course through the end of the current school term.
(2) The department of labor and industry shall adopt a process to add recognition for credentials
and work-based learning experiences between list updates that are available to any student. The process must:
(a) be set forth in administrative rule, written to include factors for consideration of inclusion and
exclusion;
(b) solely allow for a high school district or K-12 school district to submit proposed recognition; and

section.
Section 16. Incentives for school districts based on sharing resources. (1) Beginning in school
fiscal year 2027, a school district must receive an enhanced quality educator and qualified staff payment,
calculated as provided in 20-9-306 and this section, if it meets the legislative goals for resource sharing as
described in this section.
(2) If two or more school districts, or three or more school districts when one district is either an
elementary or high school district of a unified school system, cooperate to jointly employ an individual who
qualifies as a quality educator or qualified staff under 20-9-327, with each district employing the individual as no
less than a 0.33 full-time equivalent employee, that employee must be counted as a 1.0 full-time equivalent
employee for the purposes of calculating the total quality educator and qualified staff payment provided in 20-9-
306 for each district participating in the joint employment of the individual.
(3) Joint employment for school districts qualifies is met if the districts employ the individual directly
or through the terms of a multidistrict agreement as provided in 20-3-363.
