10 a joint board with a high school district may expand into a K-12 district under the procedures outlined in this
11 section only if the elementary district's ANB, as calculated under the provisions of 20-9-311, is at least 1,000.
12 (2) The expansion to a K-12 district may be requested by the trustees of an existing elementary
13 district through passage of a resolution that includes the information outlined in 20-6-105(3) and requests the
14 county superintendent to order an election to allow the electors of the elementary district to consider the
15 proposition of expanding the elementary school district into a K-12 district. The trustees of an existing
16 elementary district with an ANB of at least 1,000 may not pass a resolution for expansion more than one time
17 within a 5-year period.
18 (3) (a) If the proposition for the expansion is approved by the electors of the elementary district and
19 the trustees issue a certificate of election as provided in 20-20-416, for a period of 2 years from the date of the
20 certification of the election the elementary trustees have the authority to propose to the electors of the
21 elementary district:
22 (i) a transition costs levy pursuant to 20-9-502; and
23 (ii) a general obligation bond pursuant to Title 20, chapter 9, part 4, for the purpose of building,
24 altering, repairing, buying, furnishing, equipping, purchasing lands for, or obtaining a water supply for a school
25 to accommodate high school students.
26 (b) The bond limitations pursuant to 20-9-406 imposed on a district proposing a bond under
27 subsection (3)(a) must be calculated on the limits for a K-12 district with the high school ANB calculated by
28 dividing the ANB of the elementary district by 9 and multiplying the result by 4.

22 in which the high school will enroll students for the first time in the ensuing school year;
23 (b) the number of quality educators for the high school program must be estimated by the trustees

24 of school districts without an increase in local taxes. In furtherance of this intent, if transfers of funds are made
25 from any school district fund supported by a nonvoted levy, the district may not increase its nonvoted levy for

9 trustee resolution. (1) An existing elementary district that is not part of a unified school system or governed by
10 a joint board with a high school district may expand into a K-12 district under the procedures outlined in this
11 section only if the elementary district's ANB, as calculated under the provisions of 20-9-311, is at least 1,000.
12 (2) The expansion to a K-12 district may be requested by the trustees of an existing elementary
13 district through passage of a resolution that includes the information outlined in 20-6-105(3) and requests the

17 within a 5-year period.
18 (3) (a) If the proposition for the expansion is approved by the electors of the elementary district and

25 to accommodate high school students.
26 (b) The bond limitations pursuant to 20-9-406 imposed on a district proposing a bond under
27 subsection (3)(a) must be calculated on the limits for a K-12 district with the high school ANB calculated by
28 dividing the ANB of the elementary district by 9 and multiplying the result by 4.

22 in which the high school will enroll students for the first time in the ensuing school year;
23 (b) the number of quality educators for the high school program must be estimated by the trustees
24 and may not exceed the number resulting from dividing the ANB estimated under subsection (5)(a) by 10;

18 charter school receive operational funding on a per-pupil basis that is equitable with the per-pupil funding of the
19 located school district.
20 (2) (a) For budgeting and funding purposes, when a public charter school is operated by a local
21 school board, a public charter school must be considered a separate budget unit of the located school district,
22 must have its ANB calculated separately from other budget units of the district, and must receive a basic
23 entitlement calculated separately from other budget units of the district when its ANB is greater than:

2 risk student payment, 100% of the total Indian education for all payment, 100% of the total American Indian
3 achievement gap payment, 100% of the total data-for-achievement payment, and 140% of the special
4 education allowable cost payment. The total amount of funding received by a public charter school district
5 under this subsection (2)(b) is both the minimum amount and the maximum amount of public funding for the
6 public charter school district.
7 (c) A public charter school district is not eligible for a basic entitlement unless its ANB is greater
8 than:
9 (i) 70 for an elementary school or program;
10 (ii) 20 for a middle school or program; or
11 (iii) 40 for a high school or program.
12 (3) Students attending a public charter school governed by a local school board who are not

15 chapter 5, part 3;
16 (4) A public charter school district is prohibited from charging tuition and fees.

19 separate from the funds of the located school district.

24 obligations that exist in the located school district.
25 (8) Nothing in this part may be construed to prohibit any person or organization from providing
26 funding or other assistance for the establishment or operation of a public charter school. The governing board
27 of a public charter school is authorized to accept gifts or donations of any kind made to the public charter
28 school and to expend or use the gifts or donations in accordance with the conditions prescribed by the donor. A

13 accreditation status for the applicable school year or years must be given to each district by the superintendent
14 of public instruction.
15 (2) A school may be accredited for a period consisting of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 school years, except that
16 multiyear accreditation may be granted only to schools that are in compliance with 20-4-101.
17 (3) A nonpublic school may, through its governing body, request that the board of public education
18 accredit the school. Nonpublic schools may be accredited in the same manner as provided in subsection (1).

8 language immersion programs, a district creating an Indian language immersion program is entitled to the
9 following in addition to the school funding formula in Title 20, chapter 9:

16 language immersion program, a quality educator and qualified staff payment as calculated in 20-9-306.
17 (3) For a district operating an Indian language immersion program that improves the district's
18 graduation rate for American Indians by 5 percentage points or more from the previous year as measured by
19 the office of public instruction, the multiplier in subsection (2)(a)(i) must be increased to 3.
