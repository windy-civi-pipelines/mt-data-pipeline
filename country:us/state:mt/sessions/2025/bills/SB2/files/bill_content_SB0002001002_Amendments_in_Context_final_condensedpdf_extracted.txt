12 Section 1. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
14 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
15 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
16 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
17 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
18 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
19 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
20 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
21 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
22 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
23 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
24 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
25 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
26 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
27 labor.
28 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
