governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
years, not to exceed 4%. The The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is
established by calculating the number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually
assessed in the governmental unit in the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less 75% of the
current year's newly taxable value from class four property and the applicable amount pursuant to subsection
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – SB 117
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB 117
(1)(b) of newly taxable value from classes other than class one, class two, and class four, plus one-half of the
average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
(b) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity may include the following
percentages of newly taxable value from classes other than class one, class two, and class four:
(i) 100% of the taxable value of class eight property that receives an abatement under 15-6-
138(4)(b);
(ii) 100% of the taxable value of property that receives a new or expanding industry abatement
under 15-24-1402 or a historic property abatement under 15-24-1603 from the time the abatement is granted
through completion of construction; and
(iii) 50% if the governmental entity creates a large taxpayer reserve account and meets the deposit
requirement of [section 1(2)]; or
(iv) 40% if the governmental entity does not create a large taxpayer reserve account or does not
meet the deposit requirement of [section 1(2)].
(b)(c) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
(c)(d) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
labor.
(2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
including newly taxable property.
(3) (a) For the purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:

release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
(i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
(ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
(iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
(b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
following tax year.
(c) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property
that was constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the
current year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
(d) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the
first sale of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).

action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).

purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.

(ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
(b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) may not be included in the amount of property taxes
actually assessed in a subsequent year.
(10) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated
