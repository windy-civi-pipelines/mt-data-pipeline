13 Section 1. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
14 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
15 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
16 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
17 years, not to exceed 4%. The Subject to subsection (1)(d), the maximum number of mills that a governmental
18 entity may impose is established by calculating the number of mills required to generate the amount of property
19 tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less
20 50% of the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
21 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
22 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
23 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
24 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
25 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
26 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
27 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
28 labor.

1 (d) The levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) is limited to a fixed amount of growth and
2 may not generate an amount of property taxes that exceeds the amount of property tax assessed in the
3 governmental unit in the prior year plus 4% of the property tax assessed in the governmental unit in the prior
4 year.
5 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
6 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
7 including 50% of newly taxable property.

11 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
12 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
13 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
14 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
15 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
16 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
17 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
18 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
19 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
20 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
21 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
22 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
23 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
24 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
25 following tax year.
26 (c) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property
27 that was constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the
28 current year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
