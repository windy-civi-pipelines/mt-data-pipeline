1 WHEREAS, Montana's 163rd Infantry Regiment was recognized as the first U.S. unit to defeat Imperial
2 Japanese forces at the Battle of Sanananda, Papua New Guinea, in January 1943. They were subsequently
3 recognized by the 28th Montana Legislative Assembly through resolution and were the inspiration for a famous
4 painting by Irwin "Shorty" Shope in April 1943; and
5 WHEREAS, the 163rd Infantry Regiment served in the Pacific Theater in three major campaigns: the
6 Papuan Campaign in 1943, where they won epic battles at Sanananda, Gona, and Kumusi River; the New
7 Guinea Campaign in 1944, where they won the battles of Aitape, Wadke, and "Bloody" Biak; and the Southern
8 Philippines Campaign in 1945, where they won battles at Zamboanga, Sanga-Sanga Island, Jolo, and captured
9 the key village of Calinan from seasoned Japanese land forces, stopping only because hostilities were ceased
10 due to the dropping of atomic weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. They then became an occupation
11 force on the Japanese mainland before being demobilized in Japan on January 1, 1946, and sent home after
12 over 5 years of active duty; and
13 WHEREAS, the First Special Service Force, a unique joint US-Canadian special operations force, was
14 secretly formed at Fort William Henry Harrison near Helena, Montana, in April through July 1942, to organize
15 and train for the mission known as Operation Plough; and
16 WHEREAS, the First Special Service Force went on to serve in both the Pacific Theater and the
17 European Theater, where they fought in the Aleutians Campaign 1943, the Naples-Foggia Campaign 1943-
18 1944, the Anzio Rome-Arno Campaign 1944, recognized as being the first unit into Rome on June 4, 1944, the
19 Southern France Campaign, and the Rhineland Campaign. They were inactivated December 5, 1944, at
20 Villeneuve-Loubet, France, without losing a battle and with battle casualties equivalent to 137% of its strength.
21 The members went on to serve in the 474th Infantry Regiment in Norway through the end of the European
22 conflict as well as with other historical military units such as the 45th Infantry Division; and
23 WHEREAS, Camp Rimini War Dog Reception and Training Center was established in late 1942 west of
24 Helena at a former Civilian Conservation Corps site, where over 800 dogs and their handlers trained as a part
25 of the effort to disrupt the Axis powers. Unit members would go on to acquit themselves in places along great
26 circle military air routes as search and rescue and providing specialized transport in remote areas of the
27 Northern Hemisphere; and
28 WHEREAS, the Army Air Force organized and trained bomber forces throughout Montana at such
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – SJ 20
69th Legislature - 2025 SJ0020.2
1 locations as Great Falls, Lewistown, and Cutbank from 1941 to 1945, training personnel in the use of heavy
2 bombers that were ultimately deployed to both the European and Pacific Theaters of World War II; and
3 WHEREAS, the 7th Ferrying Command, Air Transport Command, was formed at what is now the Great
4 Falls International Airport and at what is now Malmstrom AFB, to carry out the mission of providing aircraft and
5 critical supplies to our allies over the great circle route, a critical part of global war air operation of World War II;
6 and
7 WHEREAS, specialized units such as the first all-Black airborne unit, the 555th Parachute Battalion,
8 known as the Triple Nickels, trained and served in Montana at Missoula fighting forest fires throughout Montana
9 and the Northwest; and
10 WHEREAS, the people of Montana overwhelmingly supported the World War II efforts in many ways on
11 the home front, providing food and other strategic supplies and minerals and meeting or exceeding the quotas
12 for the eight war bond drives; and
13 WHEREAS, the population of Montana in 1941 was 558,000 people and only 514,000 in 1946; and
14 WHEREAS, Montanans supported, fought, died, and were wounded in all theaters of World War II.
15 Joseph Howard Kinsey wrote in his text "High, Wide and Handsome": "--of the more than 15 million men and
16 women in the US Armed forces during World War II, Montana furnished 75,000 to the effort."; "Proportionately
17 this was near the top of all states. In World War II as in World War I, Montanans were quick to enlist, and they
18 were healthy; the proportion rejected because of physical defect was smaller than the national average. Further
19 the Montana death rate in World War II was only exceeded by that of New Mexico in proportion to population.
20 Montana [also] had the record of oversubscribing first in eight World War II saving bond drives."
21
22 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
23 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
24 That the 69th Legislature of the State of Montana recognizes the 80th anniversary of the end of World
25 War II and recognizes all Montanans who served in the armed forces, at home and abroad, and all Montanans
26 who aided in the war effort during World War II.
27 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State send a copy of this resolution to the
28 Governor of Montana, the Department Commander of the American Legion of Montana, the State Commander,
