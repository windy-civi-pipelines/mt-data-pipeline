7 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
8 MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY ON THE PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKET IN MONTANA;
9 AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH
10 LEGISLATURE.
11
12 WHEREAS, the increasing costs of insurance are further exacerbating major housing affordability
13 challenges in Montana for homeowners, landlords, and tenants; and
14 WHEREAS, high property insurance premiums hurt Montana businesses; and
15 WHEREAS, property insurance rates have been increasing significantly for all Montanans, regardless
16 of where they live; and
17 WHEREAS, Montana had the fifth-fastest increase in rates in the nation in 2024, and Montana’s
18 cumulative increases in insurance rates from 2019 to 2024 were 44.3%; and
19 WHEREAS, from 2012 to 2022, the percentage increase in Montana’s insurance premiums, as tracked
20 by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, has outpaced a national increase in rates, increasing
21 twice as fast as the national average in 5 of those 10 years; and
22 WHEREAS, the coverage provided by insurers is simultaneously shrinking for homeowners and
23 businesses despite the rapidly rising rates of property insurance; and
24 WHEREAS, Montana home values are rising unrelentingly, with the Montana Department of Revenue
25 reporting that the median residential property value increased by 32% in 2023 alone and with the Montana
26 Department of Labor reporting increases in home values of 5% to 25% each year compared to the preceding
27 decade from 2012 to 2022; and
28 WHEREAS, the rising cost of insurance may lead to difficulties in obtaining mortgages as financial

69th Legislature HJ 61.1
1 institutions become increasingly hesitant to approve loans in regions facing high insurance risks; and
2 WHEREAS, Montana has the second-highest risk in the nation for catastrophic wildfire impacts on
3 property, and some insurers are withdrawing from high-risk areas, leaving homeowners to take on more risk or
4 face higher premiums; and
5 WHEREAS, 7% of U.S. homeowners lack insurance, with higher rates in Montana than in many other
6 states; and
7 WHEREAS, Montana’s Indian and other minority populations, face disproportionately high risks from
8 wildfires and may struggle to afford rising insurance premiums or recover from losses; and
9 WHEREAS, Montana experienced 2,388 wildfires in 2024, which burned 387,966 acres, and of the
10 11.7 million recorded acres burned in the past 138 years, 70% have burned since 2000 and roughly half of the
11 acres burned prior to 2000 were in a single year, 1910, which demonstrates the increasing frequency and
12 financial burden of wildfires in the state; and
13 WHEREAS, the number of homes in high wildfire risk areas in Montana has doubled since 1990, with
14 development continuing at a rate of 450 homes a year, increasing the risk and cost of fire suppression; and
15 WHEREAS, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners reports that insurers have
16 experienced losses in 4 of the past 5 years, with insurers in Montana reporting losses in 3 of the past 5 years,
17 leading to higher premiums and reduced coverage; and
18 WHEREAS, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission, reinsurance costs had increased by
19 as much as 50% at the January 2024 renewals, and it is challenging for some carriers to even find reinsurance.
20
21 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
22 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
23 That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee, pursuant to
24 section 5-5-217, MCA, to:
25 (1) evaluate the causes of Montana’s increasing property insurance;
26 (2) determine the impact of these causes on rates; and
27 (3) analyze policy strategies that could stabilize the property insurance market and develop
28 property insurance approaches for more accessible and affordable property insurance in the state.
