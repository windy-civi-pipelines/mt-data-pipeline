2 application is correct and complete based on the provisions applicable to issuance of a state water reservation.
3 The rules must be adopted in compliance with Title 2, chapter 4.
4 (b) An applicant shall submit a correct and complete application. The determination of whether an

11 state, the applicant shall submit to and comply with the laws of the state of Montana governing the
12 appropriation, lease, use, and reservation of water.
13 (5) If the purpose of the state water reservation requires construction of a storage or diversion
14 facility, the applicant shall establish to the department by a preponderance of evidence that there will be
15 progress toward completion of the facility and accomplishment of the purpose with reasonable diligence in
16 accordance with an established plan.
17 (6) (a) Upon issuing a state water reservation for the purpose of maintaining a minimum flow, level,
18 or quality of water, the appropriation of water is complete.

20 minimum flow, level, or quality of water that it awards at any point on a stream or river to a maximum of 50% of
21 the average annual flow of record on gauged streams. Ungauged streams are not subject to the limit under this
22 subsection (6)(b).
23 (7) A state water reservation issued under this section has a priority of appropriation dating from
24 the filing of a correct and complete application with the department.
25 (8) (a) A person desiring to use water reserved to a conservation district for agricultural purposes
26 shall make application for the use with the district, and the district, upon approval of the application, shall inform
27 the department of the approved use and issue the applicant an authorization for the use. The department shall
28 maintain records of all uses of water reserved to conservation districts and be responsible, when requested by
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – SB 357
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0357.2
1 the districts, for rendering technical and administrative assistance within the department's staffing and
2 budgeting limitations in the preparation and processing of the applications for the conservation districts. The
3 department shall, within its staffing and budgeting limitations, complete any feasibility study requested by the
4 districts within 12 months of the time that the request was made. The department shall extend the time allowed
5 to develop a plan identifying projects for using a district's reservation as long as the conservation district makes
6 a good faith effort, within its staffing and budget limitations, to develop a plan.
7 (b) Upon actual application of water to the proposed beneficial use, the authorized user shall notify
8 the conservation district. The notification must contain a certified statement by a person with experience in the
9 design, construction, or operation of project works for agricultural purposes describing how the reserved water
10 was put to use. The department or the district may then inspect the appropriation to determine if it has been
11 completed in substantial accordance with the authorization.
12 (9) A state water reservation issued under this section may not adversely affect any rights in
13 existence at that time. The department may issue a state water reservation subject to terms, conditions,
14 restrictions, and limitations it considers necessary to satisfy the criteria of this section.
15 (10) (a) Except for a reservation provided in subsection (6) or a reservation provided in 85-20-1401,
16 the department shall, at least once every 10 years, review existing state water reservations to ensure that the
17 objectives of the reservations are being met.
18 (b) The department shall provide the water policy interim committee a summary of the reviews
19 before September 15, 2026, in accordance with 5-11-210.
20 (c) Following a review pursuant to this subsection (10) and except as provided in 85-2-331, at the
21 request of the entity holding a water reservation or when the objectives of a state water reservation are not
22 being met, the department may:
23 (i) extend the time period to complete the appropriation of water;
24 (ii) modify the reservation; or
25 (iii) revoke the reservation.
26 (d) Any undeveloped water made available as a result of a revocation or modification under this
27 subsection (10) is available for appropriation by others pursuant to this part.
28 (11) Except as provided in 85-20-1401, the department may modify an existing or future order
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – SB 357
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0357.2
1 originally adopted to reserve water for the purpose of maintaining minimum flow, level, or quality of water, so as
2 to reallocate the state water reservation or portion of the reservation to an applicant who is a qualified reservant
3 under this section. Reallocation of water reserved pursuant to a state water reservation may be made by the
4 department following notice and hearing if the department finds that all or part of the reservation is not required
5 for its purpose and that the need for the reallocation has been shown by the applicant to outweigh the need
6 shown by the original reservant. Reallocation of reserved water may not adversely affect the priority date of the
7 reservation, and the reservation retains its priority date despite reallocation to a different entity for a different
8 use. The department may not reallocate water reserved under this section on any stream or river more
9 frequently than once every 5 years.
10 (12) A reservant may not make a change in a state water reservation under this section, except as
11 permitted under 85-2-402 and this subsection. If the department approves a change, the department shall give
12 notice and require the reservant to establish that the criteria in subsection (4) will be met under the approved
13 change.
14 (13) A state water reservation may be transferred to another entity qualified to hold a reservation
15 under subsection (1). Only the entity holding the reservation may initiate a transfer. The transfer occurs upon
16 the filing of a water right ownership update form with the department, together with an affidavit from the entity
17 receiving the reservation establishing that the entity is a qualified reservant under subsection (1), that the entity
18 agrees to comply with the requirements of this section and the conditions of the reservation, and that the entity
19 can meet the objectives of the reservation as granted. If the transfer of a state water reservation involves a
20 change in an appropriation right, the necessary approvals must be acquired pursuant to subsection (12).
21 (14) This section does not vest the department with the authority to alter a water right that is not a
22 state water reservation.
23 (15) The department shall undertake a program to educate the public, other state agencies, and
24 political subdivisions of the state as to the benefits of the state water reservation process and the procedures to
25 be followed to secure the reservation of water. The department shall provide technical assistance to other state
26 agencies and political subdivisions in applying for reservations under this section.
27 (16) Water reserved under this section is not subject to the state water leasing program established
28 under 85-2-141."

23 the Little Missouri River basin. If the department issued a permit under Title 85, chapter 2, part 3, prior to the
24 granting of a state water reservation under this section, the department may subordinate the state water
25 reservation to the permit if it finds that the subordination does not interfere substantially with the purpose of any
26 state water reservation. If the department issued a certificate for ground water development under Title 85,
27 chapter 2, part 3, prior to the granting of a reservation under this section, the department may subordinate the
28 reservation to the certificate if it finds that the subordination does not interfere substantially with the purpose of

4 reservations for those entities listed in subsection (5)(b) as perfected until the reservant has perfected the water
5 reservatio n.

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0357.2
1 the districts, for rendering technical and administrative assistance within the department's staffing and
2 budgeting limitations in the preparation and processing of the applications for the conservation districts. The
3 department shall, within its staffing and budgeting limitations, complete any feasibility study requested by the
4 districts within 12 months of the time that the request was made. The department shall extend the time allowed
5 to develop a plan identifying projects for using a district's reservation as long as the conservation district makes
6 a good faith effort, within its staffing and budget limitations, to develop a plan.
7 (b) Upon actual application of water to the proposed beneficial use, the authorized user shall notify
8 the conservation district. The notification must contain a certified statement by a person with experience in the
9 design, construction, or operation of project works for agricultural purposes describing how the reserved water

11 completed in substantial accordance with the authorization.
12 (9) A state water reservation issued under this section may not adversely affect any rights in
13 existence at that time. The department may issue a state water reservation subject to terms, conditions,

22 being met, the department may:
23 (i) extend the time period to complete the appropriation of water;
24 (ii) modify the reservation; or
25 (iii) revoke the reservation.
26 (d) Any undeveloped water made available as a result of a revocation or modification under this
27 subsection (10) is available for appropriation by others pursuant to this part.
28 (11) Except as provided in 85-20-1401, the department may modify an existing or future order
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – SB 357

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0357.2
1 originally adopted to reserve water for the purpose of maintaining minimum flow, level, or quality of water, so as
2 to reallocate the state water reservation or portion of the reservation to an applicant who is a qualified reservant
3 under this section. Reallocation of water reserved pursuant to a state water reservation may be made by the
4 department following notice and hearing if the department finds that all or part of the reservation is not required
5 for its purpose and that the need for the reallocation has been shown by the applicant to outweigh the need
6 shown by the original reservant. Reallocation of reserved water may not adversely affect the priority date of the
7 reservation, and the reservation retains its priority date despite reallocation to a different entity for a different
8 use. The department may not reallocate water reserved under this section on any stream or river more
9 frequently than once every 5 years.
10 (12) A reservant may not make a change in a state water reservation under this section, except as
11 permitted under 85-2-402 and this subsection. If the department approves a change, the department shall give
12 notice and require the reservant to establish that the criteria in subsection (4) will be met under the approved
13 change.
14 (13) A state water reservation may be transferred to another entity qualified to hold a reservation
15 under subsection (1). Only the entity holding the reservation may initiate a transfer. The transfer occurs upon
16 the filing of a water right ownership update form with the department, together with an affidavit from the entity
17 receiving the reservation establishing that the entity is a qualified reservant under subsection (1), that the entity
18 agrees to comply with the requirements of this section and the conditions of the reservation, and that the entity
