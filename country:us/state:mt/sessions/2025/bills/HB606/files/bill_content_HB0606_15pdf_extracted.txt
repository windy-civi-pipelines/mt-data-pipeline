2 number belonging (ANB) must be computed for each budget unit as follows:
3 (a) compute an average enrollment by adding a count of regularly enrolled pupils who were
4 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
5 the first Monday in February of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if those dates do not fall on a
6 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
7 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
8 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
9 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-
10 related days may be included in the calculation.
11 (3) When a school district has approval to operate less than the minimum aggregate hours under
12 20-9-806, the total ANB must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of 20-9-805.
13 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), for the purpose of calculating ANB, enrollment in
14 an education program:
15 (i) from 180 to 359 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as one-quarter-

10 "20-9-502. Purpose and authorization of building reserve fund -- subfund structure. (1) The
11 trustees of any district may establish a building reserve fund to budget for and expend funds for any of the
12 purposes set forth in this section. Appropriate subfunds must be created to ensure separate tracking of the
13 expenditure of funds from voted and nonvoted levies and transfers for school safety pursuant to 20-9-236.
14 (2) (a) A voted levy may be imposed and a subfund must be created with the approval of the
15 qualified electors of the district for the purpose of raising money for the future construction, equipping, or
16 enlarging of school buildings or for the purpose of purchasing land needed for school purposes in the district. In
17 order to submit to the qualified electors of the district a building reserve proposition for the establishment of or
18 addition to a building reserve, the trustees shall pass a resolution that specifies:
19 (i) the purpose or purposes for which the new or addition to the building reserve will be used;
20 (ii) the duration of time over which the new or addition to the building reserve will be raised in
21 annual, equal installments;
22 (iii) the total amount of money that will be raised during the duration of time specified for the levy;
23 and
24 (iv) any other requirements under 15-10-425 and 20-20-201 for the calling of an election.

69th Legislature 2025 HB 606.1
1 building reserve proposition must be substantially in compliance with 15-10-425.
2 (d) The building reserve proposition is approved if a majority of those electors voting at the election
3 approve the establishment of or addition to the building reserve. The annual budgeting and taxation authority of
4 the trustees for a building reserve is computed by dividing the total authorized amount by the specified number
5 of years. The authority of the trustees to budget and impose the taxation for the annual amount to be raised for
6 the building reserve lapses when, at a later time, a bond issue is approved by the qualified electors of the
7 district for the same purpose or purposes for which the building reserve fund of the district was established.
8 Whenever a subsequent bond issue is made for the same purpose or purposes of a building reserve, the
9 money in the building reserve must be used for the purpose or purposes before any money realized by the
10 bond issue is used.
11 (3) (a) A subfund must be created to account for revenue and expenditures for school major
12 maintenance and repairs authorized under this subsection (3). The trustees of a district may authorize and
13 impose a levy of no more than 10 mills on the taxable value of all taxable property within the district for that
14 school fiscal year for the purposes of raising revenue for identified improvements or projects meeting the
15 requirements of 20-9-525(2). The 10-mill limit under this subsection (3) must be calculated using the district's
16 total taxable valuation most recently certified by the department of revenue under 15-10-202. The amount of
17 money raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and
18 anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) may not exceed the district's school major maintenance amount.
19 For the purposes of this section, the term "school major maintenance amount" means the sum of $15,000 and
20 the product of $110 multiplied by the district's budgeted ANB for the prior fiscal year. To authorize and impose a
21 levy under this subsection (3), the trustees shall:
22 (i) following public notice requirements pursuant to 20-9-116, adopt no later than March 31 of
23 each fiscal year a resolution:
24 (A) identifying the anticipated improvements or projects for which the proceeds of the levy, the
25 deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to
26 20-9-525(3) will be used; and
27 (B) estimating a total dollar amount of money to be raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers
28 authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3), and the

2 the department of revenue under 15-10-202; and
3 (ii) include the amount of any final levy to be imposed as part of its final budget meeting noticed in
4 compliance with 20-9-131.
5 (b) Proceeds from the levy may be expended only for the purposes under 20-9-525(2), and the
6 expenditure of the money must be reported in the annual trustees' report as required by 20-9-213.
7 (c) Whenever the trustees of a district impose a levy pursuant to this subsection (3) during the
8 current school fiscal year, they shall budget for the proceeds of the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized
9 under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) in the district's building
10 reserve fund budget. Any expenditures of the funds must be made in accordance with the financial
11 administration provisions of this title for a budgeted fund.
12 (d) When a tax levy pursuant to this subsection (3) is included as a revenue item on the final
13 building reserve fund budget, the county superintendent shall report the levy requirement to the county
14 commissioners by the later of the first Tuesday in September or within 30 calendar days after receiving certified
15 taxable values and a levy on the district must be made by the county commissioners in accordance with 20-9-
16 142.
17 (e) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for the deposit of proceeds from the
18 levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid
19 pursuant to 20-9-525(3).
20 (f) If the imposition of 10 mills pursuant to subsection (3)(a) is estimated by the trustees to
21 generate an amount less than the maximum levy revenue specified in subsection (3)(a), the trustees may
22 deposit additional funds from any lawfully available revenue source and may transfer additional funds from any
23 lawfully available fund of the district to the subfund provided for in subsection (3)(a), up to the difference
24 between the revenue estimated to be raised by the imposition of 10 mills and the maximum levy revenue
25 specified in subsection (3)(a). The district's local effort for purposes of calculating its eligibility for state school
26 major maintenance aid pursuant to 20-9-525 consists of the combined total of funds raised from the imposition
27 of 10 mills and additional funds raised from deposits and transfers in compliance with this subsection (3)(f).

17 indebtedness against any district or territory affected by a change of boundaries remains the indebtedness of
18 the original territory against which the bonds were issued and must be paid by levies on the original territory,
19 except when districts are consolidated reorganized with the mutual assumption of bonded indebtedness or

4 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
5 the first Monday in February of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if those dates do not fall on a
6 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
7 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
8 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
9 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-

11 trustees of any district may establish a building reserve fund to budget for and expend funds for any of the
12 purposes set forth in this section. Appropriate subfunds must be created to ensure separate tracking of the
13 expenditure of funds from voted and nonvoted levies and transfers for school safety pursuant to 20-9-236.
14 (2) (a) A voted levy may be imposed and a subfund must be created with the approval of the
15 qualified electors of the district for the purpose of raising money for the future construction, equipping, or
16 enlarging of school buildings or for the purpose of purchasing land needed for school purposes in the district. In
17 order to submit to the qualified electors of the district a building reserve proposition for the establishment of or
18 addition to a building reserve, the trustees shall pass a resolution that specifies:
19 (i) the purpose or purposes for which the new or addition to the building reserve will be used;

1 building reserve proposition must be substantially in compliance with 15-10-425.
2 (d) The building reserve proposition is approved if a majority of those electors voting at the election
3 approve the establishment of or addition to the building reserve. The annual budgeting and taxation authority of
4 the trustees for a building reserve is computed by dividing the total authorized amount by the specified number
5 of years. The authority of the trustees to budget and impose the taxation for the annual amount to be raised for
6 the building reserve lapses when, at a later time, a bond issue is approved by the qualified electors of the
7 district for the same purpose or purposes for which the building reserve fund of the district was established.
8 Whenever a subsequent bond issue is made for the same purpose or purposes of a building reserve, the
9 money in the building reserve must be used for the purpose or purposes before any money realized by the
10 bond issue is used.
11 (3) (a) A subfund must be created to account for revenue and expenditures for school major

14 school fiscal year for the purposes of raising revenue for identified improvements or projects meeting the
15 requirements of 20-9-525(2). The 10-mill limit under this subsection (3) must be calculated using the district's
16 total taxable valuation most recently certified by the department of revenue under 15-10-202. The amount of
17 money raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and
18 anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) may not exceed the district's school major maintenance amount.
19 For the purposes of this section, the term "school major maintenance amount" means the sum of $15,000 and
20 the product of $110 multiplied by the district's budgeted ANB for the prior fiscal year. To authorize and impose a
21 levy under this subsection (3), the trustees shall:
22 (i) following public notice requirements pursuant to 20-9-116, adopt no later than March 31 of
23 each fiscal year a resolution:

4 compliance with 20-9-131.
5 (b) Proceeds from the levy may be expended only for the purposes under 20-9-525(2), and the
6 expenditure of the money must be reported in the annual trustees' report as required by 20-9-213.
7 (c) Whenever the trustees of a district impose a levy pursuant to this subsection (3) during the
8 current school fiscal year, they shall budget for the proceeds of the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized
9 under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) in the district's building
10 reserve fund budget. Any expenditures of the funds must be made in accordance with the financial
11 administration provisions of this title for a budgeted fund.
12 (d) When a tax levy pursuant to this subsection (3) is included as a revenue item on the final
13 building reserve fund budget, the county superintendent shall report the levy requirement to the county
14 commissioners by the later of the first Tuesday in September or within 30 calendar days after receiving certified

18 levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid
19 pursuant to 20-9-525(3).
20 (f) If the imposition of 10 mills pursuant to subsection (3)(a) is estimated by the trustees to
21 generate an amount less than the maximum levy revenue specified in subsection (3)(a), the trustees may
22 deposit additional funds from any lawfully available revenue source and may transfer additional funds from any
23 lawfully available fund of the district to the subfund provided for in subsection (3)(a), up to the difference
24 between the revenue estimated to be raised by the imposition of 10 mills and the maximum levy revenue
25 specified in subsection (3)(a). The district's local effort for purposes of calculating its eligibility for state school
26 major maintenance aid pursuant to 20-9-525 consists of the combined total of funds raised from the imposition
27 of 10 mills and additional funds raised from deposits and transfers in compliance with this subsection (3)(f).
