11 electronic form:
12 (i) comparable sales data used by the department to value the property;

17 (d) For properties valued using the income approach as one approximation of market value, notice

20 (e) The review must be conducted informally and is not subject to the contested case procedures

22 selling price of the property and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer in support of the
23 taxpayer's opinion as to the market value of the property. The department shall consider an independent
24 appraisal provided by the taxpayer if the appraisal meets standards set by the Montana board of real estate

69th Legislature 2025 HB0836.2
1 (f) After the review, the department shall determine the correct appraisal and classification of the
2 land or improvements and notify the taxpayer of its determination by mail or electronically. The department may
3 not determine an appraised value that is higher than the value that was the subject of the objection unless the
4 reason for an increase was the result of a physical change in the property or caused by an error in the
5 description of the property or data available for the property that is kept by the department and used for
6 calculating the appraised value. In the notification, the department shall state its reasons for revising the
7 classification or appraisal. When the proper appraisal and classification have been determined, the land must
8 be classified and the improvements appraised in the manner ordered by the department.
9 (4) Whether a review as provided in subsection (3) is held or not, the department may not adjust
10 an appraisal or classification upon the taxpayer's objection unless:
11 (a) the taxpayer has submitted an objection on written or electronic forms provided by the
12 department or by checking a box on the notice; and
13 (b) the department has provided to the objector by mail or electronically its stated reason in writing
14 for making the adjustment.
15 (5) A taxpayer's written objection or objection made by checking a box on the notice and
16 supplemental information provided by a taxpayer that elects to check a box on the notice to a classification or
17 appraisal and the department's notification to the taxpayer of its determination and the reason for that
18 determination are public records. The department shall make the records available for inspection during regular
19 office hours.
20 (6) Except as provided in 15-2-302 and 15-23-102, if a property owner feels aggrieved by the
21 classification or appraisal made by the department after the review provided for in subsection (3), the property
22 owner has the right to first appeal to the county tax appeal board and then to the Montana tax appeal board,
23 whose findings are final subject to the right of review in the courts. The appeal to the county tax appeal board,
24 pursuant to 15-15-102, must be filed within 30 days from the date on the notice of the department's
25 determination. A county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board may consider the actual selling price
26 of the property, independent appraisals of the property, negative property features that differentiate the subject
27 property from the department's comparable sales, and other relevant information presented by the taxpayer as
28 evidence of the market value of the property. If the county tax appeal board or the Montana tax appeal board
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – HB 836

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0836.2
1 determines that an adjustment should be made, the department shall adjust the base value of the property in
