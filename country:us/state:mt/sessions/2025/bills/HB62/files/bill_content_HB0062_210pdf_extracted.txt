4 credits as provided by the statutes governing the retirement system.
5 (2) Subject to any statutory provision establishing stricter limitations, only active or vested inactive
6 members are eligible to purchase or transfer service credit, membership service, or contributions or to redeposit
7 amounts withdrawn under 19-2-602.
8 (3) An eligible member who wishes to redeposit amounts withdrawn under 19-2-602 or who is
9 eligible to purchase service credit as provided by the statutes governing the retirement system to which the
10 member belongs may elect to make a lump-sum payment by personal check or rollover of funds from another
11 eligible plan, to make installment payments, or to make a combination of a lump-sum payment and installment
12 payments.
13 (4) Installment payments must be made by personal check paid directly to the board unless the
14 member elects to make payments by irrevocable payroll deduction. The minimum installment period for
15 payments is 3 months, and the maximum installment period is 5 years. If a member making installment
16 payments by personal check ceases to make those payments, the board shall prorate the service credit based
17 on the amount paid.

19 board and the member's employer an irrevocable, written application and authorization for payroll deductions.

21 (a) must be signed by the member and the member's employer;
22 (b) must specify the dollar amount of each deduction and the number of deductions to be made,
23 subject to any maximum amounts or duration established by state or federal law;
24 (c) may not give the member the option of receiving the deduction amounts directly instead of
25 having them paid by the employer to the board; and

1 (6) If the board notifies the employer that a proper written application and authorization has been
2 filed with the board, the employer shall initiate the payroll deduction as follows:
3 (a) An employer shall pick up the member's elective additional contributions made pursuant to a
4 payroll deduction authorization. The contributions picked up by the employer must be paid from the same
5 source as is used to pay compensation to the member and must be included as part of the member's earned

11 (d) The effective date of the employer pickup and payment pursuant to this section is the date on
12 which the employee's additional contribution is first deducted from the employee's compensation. However, the
13 effective date may not be prior to the date that the member properly completes the written application and
14 authorization for payroll deductions and files it with the board. The pickup may not apply to any additional
15 contributions made before the effective date or to any contributions related to compensation earned for services
16 rendered before the effective date.

21 to the board.
22 (f) A member may file more than one irrevocable payroll deduction agreement and authorization
23 as long as a subsequent deduction authorization does not amend a previous irrevocable authorization. A

26 election and the service purchase is in accordance with 19-2-715.
27 (7) If a member terminates employment or dies before completing all payments required by a
28 payroll deduction authorization filed pursuant to this section, the deduction authorization expires and the board
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 62
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0062.2
1 shall prorate the service credit based on the amount paid unless further payment is made as provided in this
2 subsection. In the case of a termination from employment, the member may make a lump-sum payment for up
3 to the balance of the service credit remaining to be purchased, subject to the limitations of section 415 of the
4 Internal Revenue Code. In the case of death of the member, the payment may be made from the member's

22 monthly benefit or in a lump sum if that is the only benefit payable to the beneficiary.
