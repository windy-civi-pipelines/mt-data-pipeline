(d) The effective date of the employer pickup and payment pursuant to this section is the date on

this section, the installment contract payments agreed to by the member must be paid by the member directly
to the board.
(f) A member may file more than one irrevocable payroll deduction agreement and authorization
as long as a subsequent deduction authorization does not amend a previous irrevocable authorization. A
member may not prepay an amount under an irrevocable payroll deduction agreement without terminating
employment, except when a member becomes a member of another retirement system by an authorized
election and the service purchase is in accordance with 19-2-715.
(7) If a member terminates employment or dies before completing all payments required by a
payroll deduction authorization filed pursuant to this section, the deduction authorization expires and the board
shall prorate the service credit based on the amount paid unless further payment is made as provided in this

with the board a new membership form provided by the board.
(3) If a person returns to covered employment in the same retirement system pursuant to 19-2-
603, the person shall complete a new membership form and file it as provided in subsection (2). However, until
the new membership form is filed, the board shall reference the membership form executed by the person prior
to initial termination of membership for the same purposes as prior to termination. Beneficiaries designated on
that membership form continue to be beneficiaries until the new membership form is filed.
(4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b) and (4)(c), the beneficiary designation on the most
recent membership form filed with the board is effective for all purposes until the member retires.

(6) A statutory or designated beneficiary who renounces an interest in the payment rights of a
member or payment recipient will be considered, with respect to that interest, as having predeceased the
member or payment recipient.
(7) A contingent annuitant of a retired member who elected option 2, 3, or 4 pursuant to 19-3-

born after June 30, 1949. Distributions to a member's beneficiary must begin as soon as administratively
feasible, but must begin no later than December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar

(c) The employer shall establish a policy as to the payment of retroactive employer contributions or
retroactive employer contributions and regular interest and apply this policy indiscriminately for all employees

election and the service purchase is in accordance with 19-2-715.
(7) If a member terminates employment or dies before completing all payments required by a
payroll deduction authorization filed pursuant to this section, the deduction authorization expires and the board

that membership form continue to be beneficiaries until the new membership form is filed.
(4) (a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b) and (4)(c), the beneficiary designation on the most
recent membership form filed with the board is effective for all purposes until the member retires.

(6) A statutory or designated beneficiary who renounces an interest in the payment rights of a
member or payment recipient will be considered, with respect to that interest, as having predeceased the
member or payment recipient.
(7) A contingent annuitant of a retired member who elected option 2, 3, or 4 pursuant to 19-3-

provisions of the appropriate retirement system, in the partial month ending the official's term, and
compensation earned in that partial month is not subject to employer or employee contributions.

benefits must be distributed in accordance with section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and the
regulations implementing that section.
(3) The life expectancy of a member or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after
payment of the benefits has begun.

member's interest must be distributed beginning within 3 months of notification to the board of the death of the
member and, if necessary, the identification of the beneficiary pursuant to 19-2-802 and must be distributed at
least as rapidly as under the method of distribution prior to the member's death.
(5) When a member dies before distribution of benefits has begun, the entire interest of the

any portion of the member's interest that is payable to a designated beneficiary over the life or life expectancy
of the beneficiary and that begins within 1 year after the date of the member's death. The 5-year payment rule

reached 70 1/2 years of age if the member was born before July 1, 1949, or 72 years of age if the member was
born after June 30, 1949. Distributions to a member's beneficiary must begin as soon as administratively
feasible, but must begin no later than December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar
year in which the member died. If the beneficiary has not elected the form of payment by that date, payment to
the beneficiary must be made in the form of a lifetime monthly benefit payment if the beneficiary is eligible for a
monthly benefit or in a lump sum if that is the only benefit payable to the beneficiary.
(4) Death benefits must be distributed in accordance with section 401(a)(9) of the Internal
Revenue Code and the regulations implementing that section.

payment interest at the actuarially assumed rate of return in effect at the time of the request.
(c) The employer shall establish a policy as to the payment of retroactive employer contributions or
retroactive employer contributions and regular interest and apply this policy indiscriminately for all employees
and former employees. All employee appeals of discrimination are subject to the determination of the board. All
successful appeals obligate the employer to pay the employer and employee contributions with accrued interest
for that employee filing the appeal with the board. Each appeal must be heard on its individual merits and may
not bind the employer to pay all retroactive payments for all former and present employees.
(d) If the employer establishes a policy under subsection (2)(c) of nonpayment, the member shall
