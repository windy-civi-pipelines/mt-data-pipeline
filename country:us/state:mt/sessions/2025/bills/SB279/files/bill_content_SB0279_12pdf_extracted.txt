8 testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing authority in a
9 member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another
10 member state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
11 practice and procedure applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before that court. The issuing

18 In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.
19 (4) The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a licensee who changes home
20 states during the course of the investigations. The home state may also have authority to take appropriate

23 (5) A member state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover from the affected licensee the
24 costs of investigations and dispositions of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee.
25 (6) A member state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of another remote state,
26 provided that the member state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.

2 (b) Member states shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance
3 of any joint investigation initiated under the compact.
4 (8) If adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's home state license resulting in
5 an encumbrance on the home state license, the licensee's compact privilege(s) in all other member states must
6 be revoked until all encumbrances have been removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary
7 orders that impose adverse action against a licensee must include a statement that the licensee's compact
8 privileges are revoked in all member states during the pendency of the order.
9 (9) Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an unencumbered license as
10 certified by the home state's licensing authority, the licensee must meet the requirements of section 4(1) and
11 follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in any remote state.
12 (10) If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the data
13 system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the other member states of any adverse
14 actions.
15 (11) Nothing in this compact may override a member state's decision that participation in an
16 alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.

23 efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule must be invalid and
24 have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the compact
25 commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the
26 compact or the powers granted hereunder or based upon another applicable standard of review.

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 279.1
1 procedures, actions, and processes a licensed dietitian is permitted to undertake in that state and the

8 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within 4 years of the date of
9 adoption of the rule, then such rule must have no further force and effect in any member state.
10 (5) Rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the compact commission.
11 (6) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the compact commission shall hold a public hearing and
12 allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.

25 communication, the compact commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 279.1
1 (e) the manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
2 (9) All hearings must be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and
3 documents received by the compact commission in response to the proposed rule must be available to the
4 public.
5 (10) Nothing in this section may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
6 may be grouped for the convenience of the compact commission at hearings required by this section.
7 (11) The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the
8 proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.

15 emergency as provided in section 10(12), the effective date of the rule must be no sooner than 30 days after
16 issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
17 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact commission may consider and

19 procedures provided in the compact and in this section must be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
20 reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this

2 revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge
3 must be made in writing and delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no

11 (a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce
12 this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement this compact.
13 (b) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or

15 where the principal office of the compact commission is located. The compact commission may waive venue

17 proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a
18 licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
19 (c) The compact commission must be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding
20 regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and must have standing to intervene in such a
21 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission service of process must render a
22 judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
23 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:
24 (a) If the compact commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance
25 of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall
26 provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default must describe the default, the proposed
27 means of curing the default, and any other action that the compact commission may take and must offer

2 states.
3 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
4 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges,
5 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
6 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
7 default.
8 (4) Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of
9 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
10 compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the
11 defaulting state's licensing authority, and each of the member states' licensing authority.
12 (5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities

20 default or that has been terminated from the compact unless agreed upon in writing between the compact
21 commission and the defaulting state.
22 (8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact commission by petitioning the U.S.
23 district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal
24 offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
25 (9) Dispute resolution:
26 (a) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall attempt to resolve disputes
27 related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 279.1
1 dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
2 (10) Enforcement:
3 (a) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal action against a member
4 state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
5 compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
6 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
7 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
8 reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission.
9 The compact commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member
10 state's law.
11 (b) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact commission in the U.S. District
12 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal offices to
13 enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include
14 both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be
15 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
16 (c) No party other than a member state may enforce this compact against the compact
17 commission.
18 SECTION 12
19 EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL,
20 AND AMENDMENT
21 (1) The compact must come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into
22 law in the seventh member state.
23 (a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact commission shall convene and
24 review the enactment of each of the first seven member states ("charter member states") to determine if the
25 statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact statute.
26 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
27 compact statute must be entitled to the default process set forth in section 11.
28 (ii) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated, or withdraws from the
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – SB 279
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 279.1
1 compact, the compact commission shall remain in existence and the compact must remain in effect even if the
2 number of member states should be less than seven.
3 (b) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member states
4 must be subject to the process set forth in section 8(3)(u) to determine if their enactments are materially
5 different from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
6 (c) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in furtherance of the purposes of
7 the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the compact commission coming
8 into existence must be considered to be actions of the compact commission unless specifically repudiated by
9 the compact commission.
10 (d) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact commission's initial adoption of the
11 rules and bylaws must be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact

13 the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.
14 (2) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.
15 (a) A member state's withdrawal may not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the
16 repealing statute.
17 (b) Withdrawal may not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's licensing
18 authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
19 effective date of withdrawal.
20 (c) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately
21 provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
22 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges granted
23 pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
24 (3) Nothing contained in this compact may be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure
25 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
26 conflict with the provisions of this compact.
27 (4) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact may
28 become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.

1 SECTION 13
2 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
3 (1) This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed
4 so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the
5 compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the compact
6 commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
7 (2) The provisions of this compact must be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
8 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
9 member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
10 to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
11 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
12 agency, person, or circumstance may not be affected thereby.
13 (3) Notwithstanding section 13(2), the compact commission may deny a state's participation in the
14 compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 11(2), terminate a member state's participation in
15 the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from
16 the compact. Otherwise, if this compact must be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the
17 compact must remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to
18 the member state affected as to all severable matters.
19 SECTION 14

25 the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.

8 testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing authority in a
9 member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another
10 member state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
11 practice and procedure applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before that court. The issuing

13 of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.

16 (3) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give the same priority and effect to

18 In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.
19 (4) The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a licensee who changes home
20 states during the course of the investigations. The home state may also have authority to take appropriate
21 action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of the data system.

23 (5) A member state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover from the affected licensee the
24 costs of investigations and dispositions of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee.
25 (6) A member state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of another remote state,
26 provided that the member state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.
27 (7) Joint investigations:
28 (a) In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respective state law, any member

1 state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of licensees.
2 (b) Member states shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance
3 of any joint investigation initiated under the compact.
4 (8) If adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's home state license resulting in
5 an encumbrance on the home state license, the licensee's compact privilege(s) in all other member states must
6 be revoked until all encumbrances have been removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary
7 orders that impose adverse action against a licensee must include a statement that the licensee's compact
8 privileges are revoked in all member states during the pendency of the order.
9 (9) Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an unencumbered license as
10 certified by the home state's licensing authority, the licensee must meet the requirements of section 4(1) and
11 follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in any remote state.
12 (10) If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the data
13 system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the other member states of any adverse
14 actions.
15 (11) Nothing in this compact may override a member state's decision that participation in an
16 alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.

25 of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall

4 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges,
5 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
6 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
7 default.
8 (4) Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of
9 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
10 compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the
11 defaulting state's licensing authority, and each of the member states' licensing authority.

24 offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.

4 state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
5 compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
6 promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
7 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
8 reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission.

19 EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL,
20 AND AMENDMENT
21 (1) The compact must come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into
22 law in the seventh member state.
23 (a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact commission shall convene and
24 review the enactment of each of the first seven member states ("charter member states") to determine if the
25 statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact statute.
26 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model

15 (a) A member state's withdrawal may not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the

18 authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
19 effective date of withdrawal.
20 (c) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately
21 provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory

25 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
26 conflict with the provisions of this compact.

1 SECTION 13
2 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
3 (1) This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed
4 so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the
5 compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the compact
6 commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.

8 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any

10 to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
11 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
12 agency, person, or circumstance may not be affected thereby.
13 (3) Notwithstanding section 13(2), the compact commission may deny a state's participation in the
14 compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 11(2), terminate a member state's participation in
15 the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from
16 the compact. Otherwise, if this compact must be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the
17 compact must remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to
18 the member state affected as to all severable matters.
