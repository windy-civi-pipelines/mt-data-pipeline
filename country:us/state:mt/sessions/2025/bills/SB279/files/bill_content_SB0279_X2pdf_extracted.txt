testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing authority in a
member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another

authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes
of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
(2) Only the home state may have the power to take adverse action against a licensee's home
state license.
(3) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give the same priority and effect to
reported conduct received from a member state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the home state.
In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.
(4) The home state shall complete any pending investigations of a licensee who changes home
states during the course of the investigations. The home state may also have authority to take appropriate
action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of the data system.
The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the new home state of any adverse actions.
(5) A member state, if otherwise permitted by state law, may recover from the affected licensee the
costs of investigations and dispositions of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee.
(6) A member state may take adverse action based on the factual findings of another remote state,
provided that the member state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.
(7) Joint investigations:
(a) In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respective state law, any member
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – SB 279
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 279
state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of licensees.
(b) Member states shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance
of any joint investigation initiated under the compact.
(8) If adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's home state license resulting in
an encumbrance on the home state license, the licensee's compact privilege(s) in all other member states must
be revoked until all encumbrances have been removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary
orders that impose adverse action against a licensee must include a statement that the licensee's compact
privileges are revoked in all member states during the pendency of the order.
(9) Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an unencumbered license as
certified by the home state's licensing authority, the licensee must meet the requirements of section 4(1) and
follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in any remote state.
(10) If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the data
system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the other member states of any adverse
actions.
(11) Nothing in this compact may override a member state's decision that participation in an
alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.

this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement this compact.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or
against the compact commission must be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction
where the principal office of the compact commission is located. The compact commission may waive venue
and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a
licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
(c) The compact commission must be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding
regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and must have standing to intervene in such a

of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall

compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges,
and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
default.
(4) Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of
securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the
defaulting state's licensing authority, and each of the member states' licensing authority.
(5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
termination.
(6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately
provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to
recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 6 months after the date of
said notice of termination.

default or that has been terminated from the compact unless agreed upon in writing between the compact
commission and the defaulting state.
(8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact commission by petitioning the U.S.

offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.

state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission.
The compact commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member
state's law.
(b) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact commission in the U.S. District
court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal offices to
enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include

awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.

agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
conflict with the provisions of this compact.

become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.

SECTION 13
CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
(1) This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed
so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the
compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the compact
commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
(2) The provisions of this compact must be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
agency, person, or circumstance may not be affected thereby.
(3) Notwithstanding section 13(2), the compact commission may deny a state's participation in the
compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 11(2), terminate a member state's participation in
the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from
the compact. Otherwise, if this compact must be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the

the member state affected as to all severable matters.

of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
(2) Only the home state may have the power to take adverse action against a licensee's home
state license.
(3) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give the same priority and effect to
reported conduct received from a member state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the home state.
In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.

- 9 - Authorized Print Version – SB 279
ENROLLED BILL

state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of licensees.
(b) Member states shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance

an encumbrance on the home state license, the licensee's compact privilege(s) in all other member states must
be revoked until all encumbrances have been removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary
orders that impose adverse action against a licensee must include a statement that the licensee's compact
privileges are revoked in all member states during the pendency of the order.
(9) Once an encumbered license in the home state is restored to an unencumbered license as
certified by the home state's licensing authority, the licensee must meet the requirements of section 4(1) and
follow the administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a compact privilege in any remote state.
(10) If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the data
system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the other member states of any adverse
actions.

alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.

(11) The compact commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the
proposed rule based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
(a) The compact commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do
not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.
(b) The compact commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes
made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
commenters.
(c) The compact commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
emergency as provided in section 10(12), the effective date of the rule must be no sooner than 30 days after
issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
(12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the compact commission may consider and
adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking
procedures provided in the compact and in this section must be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this
provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
(a) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
(b) prevent a loss of compact commission or member state funds;
(c) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or
(d) protect public health and safety.
(13) The compact commission or an authorized committee of the compact commission may direct
revision to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in
consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision must be posted on the website of the compact

commission. The revision must be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The
revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge
must be made in writing and delivered to the compact commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no
challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision
may not take effect without the approval of the compact commission.
(14) No member state's rulemaking requirements may apply under this compact.
SECTION 11
OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION,
AND ENFORCEMENT
(1) Oversight:
(a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce
this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement this compact.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in this compact, venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or
against the compact commission must be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction
where the principal office of the compact commission is located. The compact commission may waive venue
and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a
licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
(c) The compact commission must be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding
regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact and must have standing to intervene in such a
proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the compact commission service of process must render a
judgment or order void as to the compact commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
(2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:
(a) If the compact commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance
of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the compact commission shall
provide written notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default must describe the default, the proposed
means of curing the default, and any other action that the compact commission may take and must offer
training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.

ENROLLED BILL

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 279
(b) The compact commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member
states.
(3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges,
and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
default.
(4) Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of
securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
compact commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the
defaulting state's licensing authority, and each of the member states' licensing authority.
(5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
termination.
(6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately
provide notice to all licensees within that state of such termination. The terminated state shall continue to
recognize all compact privileges granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 6 months after the date of
said notice of termination.
(7) The compact commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in
default or that has been terminated from the compact unless agreed upon in writing between the compact
commission and the defaulting state.
(8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the compact commission by petitioning the U.S.
district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal
offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(9) Dispute resolution:
(a) Upon request by a member state, the compact commission shall attempt to resolve disputes
related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.
(b) The compact commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding
- 22 - Authorized Print Version – SB 279
ENROLLED BILL

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 279
dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
(10) Enforcement:
(a) By supermajority vote, the compact commission may initiate legal action against a member
state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
compact commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its
promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the compact commission.
The compact commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member
state's law.
(b) A member state may initiate legal action against the compact commission in the U.S. District
court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the compact commission has its principal offices to
enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include
both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be
awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(c) No party other than a member state may enforce this compact against the compact
commission.
SECTION 12
EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL,
AND AMENDMENT
(1) The compact must come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into
law in the seventh member state.
(a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the compact commission shall convene and
review the enactment of each of the first seven member states ("charter member states") to determine if the
statute enacted by each such charter member state is materially different than the model compact statute.
(i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
compact statute must be entitled to the default process set forth in section 11.
(ii) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated, or withdraws from the
- 23 - Authorized Print Version – SB 279
ENROLLED BILL

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 279
compact, the compact commission shall remain in existence and the compact must remain in effect even if the
number of member states should be less than seven.
(b) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the seven initial charter member states
must be subject to the process set forth in section 8(3)(u) to determine if their enactments are materially
different from the model compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
(c) All actions taken for the benefit of the compact commission or in furtherance of the purposes of
the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the compact commission coming
into existence must be considered to be actions of the compact commission unless specifically repudiated by
the compact commission.
(d) Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the compact commission's initial adoption of the
rules and bylaws must be subject to the rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact
becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the compact commission must have
the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.
(2) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.
(a) A member state's withdrawal may not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the
repealing statute.
(b) Withdrawal may not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's licensing
authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the
effective date of withdrawal.
(c) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, a state shall immediately
provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges granted
pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
(3) Nothing contained in this compact may be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure
agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
conflict with the provisions of this compact.
(4) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact may
become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.

SECTION 13
CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
(1) This compact and the compact commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed
so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the
compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the compact
commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
(2) The provisions of this compact must be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
agency, person, or circumstance may not be affected thereby.
(3) Notwithstanding section 13(2), the compact commission may deny a state's participation in the
compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 11(2), terminate a member state's participation in
the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from
the compact. Otherwise, if this compact must be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the
compact must remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to
the member state affected as to all severable matters.
SECTION 14
CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT
WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
(1) Nothing herein may prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that
is not inconsistent with the compact.
(2) Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in conflict with
the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
(3) All permissible agreements between the compact commission and the member states are
binding in accordance with their terms.
