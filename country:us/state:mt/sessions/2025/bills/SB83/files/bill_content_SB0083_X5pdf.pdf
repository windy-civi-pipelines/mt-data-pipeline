consider landowner tolerance when deciding whether to restrict elk hunting on surrounding public land in a

combination thereof to a landowner or a landowner's designee pursuant to 87-2-513.
(2) The commission may adopt rules regarding the use and type of archery equipment that may be
employed for hunting and fishing purposes, taking into account applicable standards as technical innovations in
archery equipment change.
(3) The commission may adopt rules regarding the establishment of special licenses or permits,
seasons, conditions, programs, or other provisions that the commission considers appropriate to promote or
enhance hunting by Montana's youth and persons with disabilities.
(4) (a) The commission may adopt rules regarding nonresident big game combination licenses to:
(i) separate deer licenses from nonresident elk combination licenses;
(ii) set the fees for the separated deer combination licenses and the elk combination licenses
without the deer tag;
(iii) condition the use of the deer licenses; and

(b) The commission may exercise the rulemaking authority in subsection (4)(a) when it is
necessary and appropriate to regulate the harvest by nonresident big game combination license holders:
(i) for the biologically sound management of big game populations of elk, deer, and antelope;
(ii) to control the impacts of those elk, deer, and antelope populations on uses of private property;
and
(iii) to ensure that elk, deer, and antelope populations are at a sustainable level as provided in 87-
1-321 through 87-1-325.
(5) (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (5)(b), the commission may adopt rules to:
(i) limit the number of nonresident mountain lion hunters in designated hunting districts; and
(ii) determine the conditions under which nonresidents may hunt mountain lion in designated
hunting districts.
(b) The commission shall adopt rules for the use of and set quotas for the sale of Class D-4
nonresident hound licenses by hunting district, portions of a hunting district, group of districts, or administrative
regions.
(c) The commission shall consider, but is not limited to consideration of, the following factors:

(iii) composition, including age and sex, of the lion harvest;
(iv) historical outfitter use;
(v) conflicts among hunter groups;

(vii) whether restrictions on nonresident hunters are more appropriate than restrictions on all
hunters.

ammunition, including the chemical elements of ammunition used for hunting. This does not prevent:
(a) the restriction of certain hunting seasons to the use of specified hunting arms, such as the
establishment of special archery seasons and the special muzzleloader heritage hunting season established in
87-1-304;
