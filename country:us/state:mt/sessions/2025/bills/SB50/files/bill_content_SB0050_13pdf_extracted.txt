15 "41-3-423. Reasonable efforts required to prevent removal of child or to return -- exemption --
16 findings -- permanency plan. (1) (a) The department shall make reasonable efforts to prevent the necessity of
17 removal of a child from the child's home and to reunify families that have been separated by the state. The
18 application for a warrant to remove a child from the child's home pursuant to [section 1] does not absolve the
19 department from the duty to make reasonable efforts to prevent the necessity of removal.
20 (b) For the purposes of this subsection (1), the term "reasonable efforts" means the department
21 shall in good faith:
22 (i) conduct a comprehensive assessment of the circumstances of the family, with a focus on safe
23 reunification as the most desirable goal. The assessment must be provided to the parents and to counsel for
24 the parents.
25 (ii) identify appropriate services and help the parents overcome barriers, including actively
26 assisting the parents in obtaining appropriate services;

6 facilitate the use of remedial and rehabilitative services;
7 (vi) take steps to keep siblings together whenever possible;

9 visits with the child during any period of removal, consistent with the need to ensure the health, safety, and

15 (x) consider alternative ways to address the needs of the parents and, when appropriate, the

21 Child Welfare Act provided for in Title 41, chapter 3, part 13], the department may, at any time during an abuse
22 and neglect proceeding, make a request for a determination that preservation or reunification services need not
23 be provided. If an indigent parent is not already represented by counsel, the court shall immediately provide for
24 the appointment or assignment of counsel to represent the indigent parent in accordance with the provisions of
25 41-3-425. A court may make a finding that the department need not make reasonable efforts to provide
26 preservation or reunification services if the court finds that the parent has:

4 (d) committed neglect of a child that resulted in serious bodily injury or death; or
5 (e) had parental rights to the child's sibling or other child of the parent involuntarily terminated and

7 care for the child at issue.
8 (3) Preservation or reunification services are not required for a putative father, as defined in 42-2-
9 201, if the court makes a finding that the putative father has failed to do any of the following:
10 (a) contribute to the support of the child for an aggregate period of 1 year, although able to do so;
11 (b) establish a substantial relationship with the child. A substantial relationship is demonstrated by:
12 (i) visiting the child at least monthly when physically and financially able to do so; or
13 (ii) having regular contact with the child or with the person or agency having the care and custody

22 must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.

24 subsection (2) or (3), a permanency hearing must be held within 30 days of that determination and reasonable
25 efforts, including consideration of both in-state and out-of-state permanent placement options for the child, must
