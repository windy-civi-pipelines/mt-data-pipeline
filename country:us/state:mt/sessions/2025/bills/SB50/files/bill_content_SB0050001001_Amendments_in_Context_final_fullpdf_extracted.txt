22 sole reason that a parent or legal guardian, because of religious beliefs, does not provide adequate health care
23 for a child. However, this chapter may not be construed to limit the administrative or judicial authority of the
24 state to ensure that medical care is provided to the child when there is imminent substantial risk of serious harm
