14 Section 1. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
15 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
16 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
17 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
18 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
19 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
20 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
21 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
22 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
23 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
24 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
25 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
26 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
27 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
28 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of

1 labor.
2 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
3 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
4 including newly taxable property.
5 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
6 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
7 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
8 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
9 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
10 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
11 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
12 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
13 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
14 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
15 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
16 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
17 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
18 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
19 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
20 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
21 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
22 following tax year.
23 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
24 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
25 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
26 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
27 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
28 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).

1 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:
2 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or
3 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
4 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
5 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
6 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
7 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
8 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
9 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
10 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
11 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
12 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
13 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
14 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
15 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
16 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

22 property tax levy for contributions for group benefits excluded under 2-9-212 or 2-18-703;
23 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
24 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
25 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404 (3)(b) 19-7-404(2)(b); or
26 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
27 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
28 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.

15 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
16 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
17 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
18 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
19 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
20 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
21 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
22 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
23 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
24 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
25 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
26 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
27 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
28 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of

2 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
3 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,

8 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
9 (iv) subdivision of real property; and

11 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
12 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
13 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
14 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
15 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
16 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
17 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
18 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
19 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
20 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
21 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
22 following tax year.
23 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
24 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
25 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
26 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
27 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
28 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
