23 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,

6 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
7 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
8 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
9 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
10 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
11 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
12 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
13 shall deny the territory transfer.
14 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
15 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
16 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
17 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section. The county
18 superintendent shall notify the department of revenue of the approval of a petition to transfer territory from one
19 school district to another.
20 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
21 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
22 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
23 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
24 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
25 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
26 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
27 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
28 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.

15 taxable value of all property within the transferred territory.
16 (13) (a) When a petition to transfer territory has been granted for a school district that has paid a
17 reconciliation payment to another school district under [section 12]:
18 (i) the school district to which the territory has been transferred shall budget and impose a levy for
19 3 consecutive years following the transfer to generate revenue equal to the most recent reconciliation payment
20 it received from the district from which the territory has been transferred; and
21 (ii) the school district imposing the levy shall deposit the revenue in its tuition fund and pay the
22 district from which the territory was transferred an amount equal to the revenue raised in subsection (13)(a)(i)
23 for 3 consecutive years following the transfer, with at least half of the annual payment made by December 31
24 and the remainder by June 15 of the same fiscal year.
25 (b) The district from which the territory is transferred shall deposit the received payment in its
