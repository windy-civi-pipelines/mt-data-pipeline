3 of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years is equal to or greater than 25% of the
4 district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the decision:
5 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8
6 years;
7 (B) the district's reduction or elimination of instructional staff or programs over the previous 8
8 years; and
9 (C) any increase in district taxes over the previous 8 years and the likely increase in district taxes if
10 the transfer is granted.
11 (7) After receiving evidence from both the proponents and opponents of the proposed territory
12 transfer on the effects described in subsection (6), the county superintendent shall, within 30 days after the
13 hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order.
14 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
15 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
16 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
17 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
18 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
19 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
20 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
21 shall deny the territory transfer.
22 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
23 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
24 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
25 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section. THE COUNTY
26 SUPERINTENDENT SHALL NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF THE APPROVAL OF A PETITION TO TRANSFER
27 TERRITORY FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER.

2 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
3 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
4 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
5 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
6 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
7 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
8 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
9 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
10 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
11 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
12 invalid for the purposes of this section.

14 IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER:

3 RECONCILIATION PAYMENT IT RECEIVED FROM THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED; AND

3 petitioners have the initial burden of presenting evidence on the proposed transfer's effect on:

5 but not limited to:
6 (i) class size;

28 and
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – SB 260

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0260.4
1 (v) the cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years on
2 the taxable value of the district from which the territory is to be transferred. In cases where the cumulative effect
3 of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years is equal to or greater than 25% of the
4 district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the decision:
5 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8
6 years;
7 (B) the district's reduction or elimination of instructional staff or programs over the previous 8
8 years; and
9 (C) any increase in district taxes over the previous 8 years and the likely increase in district taxes if
10 the transfer is granted.
11 (7) After receiving evidence from both the proponents and opponents of the proposed territory
12 transfer on the effects described in subsection (6), the county superintendent shall, within 30 days after the
13 hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order.
14 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
15 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
16 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
17 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
18 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
19 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
20 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
21 shall deny the territory transfer.
22 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
23 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
24 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
25 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section. THE COUNTY
26 SUPERINTENDENT SHALL NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF THE APPROVAL OF A PETITION TO TRANSFER
27 TERRITORY FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER.
28 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – SB 260

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0260.4
1 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
2 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
3 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
4 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
5 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
6 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
7 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
8 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
9 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
10 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
11 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
12 invalid for the purposes of this section.
13 (12) IF A PETITION TO TRANSFER TERRITORY IS GRANTED UNDER THIS SECTION, FOR THE 3 YEARS
14 IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER:
15 (A) THE TAXABLE VALUE OF TERRITORY TRANSFERRED MUST BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE SCHOOL
16 DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY WAS TRANSFERRED AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO WHICH THE PROPERTY WAS
17 TRANSFERRED;
18 (B) WHEN CERTIFYING TAXABLE VALUES PURSUANT TO 15-10-202, THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE SHALL
19 INCLUDE HALF OF THE CERTIFIED VALUE OF THE TRANSFERRED TERRITORY IN EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT'S CERTIFIED
20 TAXABLE VALUE;
21 (C) EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT SHALL CALCULATE THE MILLS REQUIRED FOR ITS DISTRICT OPERATIONAL
22 LEVIES, AS DEFINED IN [SECTION 10], BASED ON THE CERTIFIED TAXABLE VALUE PROVIDED UNDER SUBSECTION (12)(B);
23 AND
24 (D) WHEN LEVYING TAXES FOR DISTRICT OPERATIONAL LEVIES PURSUANT TO 20-9-142, THE COUNTY
25 COMMISSIONERS SHALL FIX AND LEVY ONE-HALF OF THE NUMBER OF MILLS FOR EACH DISTRICT'S OPERATIONAL LEVIES
26 ON THE FULL TAXABLE VALUE OF ALL PROPERTY WITHIN THE TRANSFERRED TERRITORY.
27 (13) (A) WHEN A PETITION TO TRANSFER TERRITORY HAS BEEN GRANTED FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT
28 HAS PAID A RECONCILIATION PAYMENT TO ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT UNDER [SECTION 12]:
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – SB 260

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0260.4
1 (I) THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO WHICH THE TERRITORY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED SHALL BUDGET AND IMPOSE
2 A LEVY FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER TO GENERATE REVENUE EQUAL TO THE MOST RECENT
3 RECONCILIATION PAYMENT IT RECEIVED FROM THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED; AND
4 (II) THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IMPOSING THE LEVY SHALL DEPOSIT THE REVENUE IN ITS TUITION FUND AND PAY
5 THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY WAS TRANSFERRED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE REVENUE RAISED IN
6 SUBSECTION (13)(A)(I) FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER, WITH AT LEAST HALF OF THE ANNUAL
7 PAYMENT MADE BY DECEMBER 31 AND THE REMAINDER BY JUNE 15 OF THE SAME FISCAL YEAR.
8 (B) THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY IS TRANSFERRED SHALL DEPOSIT THE RECEIVED PAYMENT
9 IN ITS FLEXIBILITY FUND OR ALLOCATE IT AMONG ITS BUDGETED FUNDS AS DETERMINED BY THE TRUSTEES."
