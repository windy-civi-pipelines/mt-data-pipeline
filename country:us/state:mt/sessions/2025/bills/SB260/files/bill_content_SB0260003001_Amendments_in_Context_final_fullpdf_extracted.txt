2 (A) IF THE TRANSFER IS APPROVED, the taxpayers of the district from which the territory will be

15 of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years is equal to or greater than 25% of the
16 district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the decision:
17 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8

1 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
2 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
3 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
4 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
5 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
6 shall deny the territory transfer.

8 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
9 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
10 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section. THE COUNTY
11 SUPERINTENDENT SHALL NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF THE APPROVAL OF A PETITION TO TRANSFER
12 TERRITORY FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER.
13 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
14 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
15 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
16 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
17 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
18 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
19 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
20 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
21 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.

23 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
24 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
25 invalid for the purposes of this section.

2 proposed territory transfer in writing, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer.
3 (5) For any petition that meets the criteria specified in subsection (1) and contains the information
4 required by subsection (3) but that has not been approved in writing by the board of trustees of the school
5 district that would transfer the territory, the county superintendent shall:
6 (a) not more than 40 days after receipt of the petition, set a place, date, and time for a hearing to

1 (i) the existence of a significant burden on:
2 (A) IF THE TRANSFER IS APPROVED, the taxpayers of the district from which the territory will be
3 transferred; OR
4 (B) IF THE TRANSFER IS REJECTED, THE TAXPAYERS OF THE DISTRICT TO WHICH THE TERRITORY IS TO BE
5 TRANSFERRED;
6 (ii) the significance of any loss in state funding for the students in both the receiving and
7 transferring districts;
8 (iii) the viability of the future bonding capacity of the receiving and transferring districts, including
9 but not limited to the ability of the receiving district and the transferring district to meet minimum bonding
10 requirements;
11 (iv) the ability of the receiving district and the transferring district to maintain sufficient reserves;
12 and
13 (v) the cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years on
14 the taxable value of the district from which the territory is to be transferred. In cases where the cumulative effect
15 of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years is equal to or greater than 25% of the
16 district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the decision:
17 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8
18 years;
19 (B) the district's reduction or elimination of instructional staff or programs over the previous 8

24 transfer on the effects described in subsection (6), the county superintendent shall, within 30 days after the
25 hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order.

27 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the

1 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
2 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
3 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
4 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
5 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
6 shall deny the territory transfer.
7 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
8 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
9 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
10 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section. THE COUNTY
11 SUPERINTENDENT SHALL NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF THE APPROVAL OF A PETITION TO TRANSFER
12 TERRITORY FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER.
13 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
14 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
15 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
16 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
17 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
18 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
19 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
20 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
21 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
22 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
23 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
24 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
25 invalid for the purposes of this section.

17 RECONCILIATION PAYMENT IT RECEIVED FROM THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED; AND
18 (II) THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IMPOSING THE LEVY SHALL DEPOSIT THE REVENUE IN ITS TUITION FUND AND PAY
19 THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY WAS TRANSFERRED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE REVENUE RAISED IN
