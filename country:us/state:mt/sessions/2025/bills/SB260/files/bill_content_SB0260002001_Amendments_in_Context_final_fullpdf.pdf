27 transferred; OR

1 (B) IF THE TRANSFER IS REJECTED, THE TAXPAYERS OF THE DISTRICT TO WHICH THE TERRITORY IS TO BE
2 TRANSFERRED;
3 (ii) the significance of any loss in state funding for the students in both the receiving and
4 transferring districts;
5 (iii) the viability of the future bonding capacity of the receiving and transferring districts, including
6 but not limited to the ability of the receiving district and the transferring district to meet minimum bonding
7 requirements;
8 (iv) the ability of the receiving district and the transferring district to maintain sufficient reserves;
9 and
10 (v) the cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years on
11 the taxable value of the district from which the territory is to be transferred. In cases where the cumulative effect
12 of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years is equal to or greater than 25% of the
13 district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the decision:
14 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8
15 years;
16 (B) the district's reduction or elimination of instructional staff or programs over the previous 8
17 years; and
18 (C) any increase in district taxes over the previous 8 years and the likely increase in district taxes if
19 the transfer is granted.
20 (7) After receiving evidence from both the proponents and opponents of the proposed territory
21 transfer on the effects described in subsection (6), the county superintendent shall, within 30 days after the
22 hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order.
23 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
24 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
25 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
26 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
27 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a

1 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
2 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
3 shall deny the territory transfer.
4 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
5 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
6 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
7 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section. THE COUNTY
8 SUPERINTENDENT SHALL NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF THE APPROVAL OF A PETITION TO TRANSFER
9 TERRITORY FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER.
10 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
11 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
12 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
13 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
14 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
15 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
16 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
17 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
18 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
19 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
20 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
21 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
22 invalid for the purposes of this section.
23 (12) IF A PETITION TO TRANSFER TERRITORY IS GRANTED UNDER THIS SECTION, FOR THE 3 YEARS
24 IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER:
25 (A) THE TAXABLE VALUE OF TERRITORY TRANSFERRED MUST BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE SCHOOL
26 DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY WAS TRANSFERRED AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO WHICH THE PROPERTY WAS
27 TRANSFERRED;

1 (B) WHEN CERTIFYING TAXABLE VALUES PURSUANT TO 15-10-202, THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE SHALL
2 INCLUDE HALF OF THE CERTIFIED VALUE OF THE TRANSFERRED TERRITORY IN EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT'S CERTIFIED
3 TAXABLE VALUE;
4 (C) EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT SHALL CALCULATE THE MILLS REQUIRED FOR ITS DISTRICT OPERATIONAL
5 LEVIES, AS DEFINED IN [SECTION 10], BASED ON THE CERTIFIED TAXABLE VALUE PROVIDED UNDER SUBSECTION (12)(B);
6 AND
7 (D) WHEN LEVYING TAXES FOR DISTRICT OPERATIONAL LEVIES PURSUANT TO 20-9-142, THE COUNTY
8 COMMISSIONERS SHALL FIX AND LEVY ONE-HALF OF THE NUMBER OF MILLS FOR EACH DISTRICT'S OPERATIONAL LEVIES
9 ON THE FULL TAXABLE VALUE OF ALL PROPERTY WITHIN THE TRANSFERRED TERRITORY.
10 (13) (A) WHEN A PETITION TO TRANSFER TERRITORY HAS BEEN GRANTED FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT
11 HAS PAID A RECONCILIATION PAYMENT TO ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT UNDER [SECTION 12]:
12 (I) THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO WHICH THE TERRITORY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED SHALL BUDGET AND IMPOSE
13 A LEVY FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER TO GENERATE REVENUE EQUAL TO THE MOST RECENT
14 RECONCILIATION PAYMENT IT RECEIVED FROM THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED; AND
15 (II) THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IMPOSING THE LEVY SHALL DEPOSIT THE REVENUE IN ITS TUITION FUND AND PAY
16 THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY WAS TRANSFERRED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE REVENUE RAISED IN
17 SUBSECTION (13)(A)(I) FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER, WITH AT LEAST HALF OF THE ANNUAL
18 PAYMENT MADE BY DECEMBER 31 AND THE REMAINDER BY JUNE 15 OF THE SAME FISCAL YEAR.
19 (B) THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY IS TRANSFERRED SHALL DEPOSIT THE RECEIVED PAYMENT
20 IN ITS FLEXIBILITY FUND OR ALLOCATE IT AMONG ITS BUDGETED FUNDS AS DETERMINED BY THE TRUSTEES."
