15 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
16 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
17 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
18 shall deny the territory transfer.
19 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
20 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
21 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
22 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section.
23 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
24 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
25 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
26 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
27 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number

1 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
2 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
3 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
4 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
5 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
6 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
7 invalid for the purposes of this section."

1 to the board of trustees of the school district from which the territory is to be transferred.
2 (6) The county superintendent shall conduct a hearing as scheduled, and any resident, taxpayer,
3 or representative of the receiving or transferring district must, upon request, be heard. At the hearing, the
4 petitioners have the initial burden of presenting evidence on the proposed transfer's effect on:
5 (a) the educational opportunity for the students in the receiving and transferring districts, including
6 but not limited to:
7 (i) class size;
8 (ii) ability to maintain demographic diversity;
9 (iii) local control;
10 (iv) parental involvement; and
11 (v) the capability of the receiving district to provide educational services;
12 (b) student transportation, including but not limited to:
13 (i) safety;
14 (ii) cost; and
15 (iii) travel time of students;
16 (c) the economic viability of the proposed new districts, including but not limited to:
17 (i) the existence of a significant burden on the taxpayers of the district from which the territory will
18 be transferred;
19 (ii) the significance of any loss in state funding for the students in both the receiving and
20 transferring districts;
21 (iii) the viability of the future bonding capacity of the receiving and transferring districts, including
22 but not limited to the ability of the receiving district and the transferring district to meet minimum bonding
23 requirements;
24 (iv) the ability of the receiving district and the transferring district to maintain sufficient reserves;
25 and
26 (v) the cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years on
27 the taxable value of the district from which the territory is to be transferred. In cases where the cumulative effect
28 of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years is equal to or greater than 25% of the
- 6 - LC 3227

69th Legislature 2025 LC 3227
1 district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the decision:
2 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8
3 years;
4 (B) the district's reduction or elimination of instructional staff or programs over the previous 8
5 years; and
6 (C) any increase in district taxes over the previous 8 years and the likely increase in district taxes if
7 the transfer is granted.
8 (7) After receiving evidence from both the proponents and opponents of the proposed territory
9 transfer on the effects described in subsection (6), the county superintendent shall, within 30 days after the
10 hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order.
11 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
12 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
13 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
14 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
15 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
16 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
17 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
18 shall deny the territory transfer.
19 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
20 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
21 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
22 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section.
23 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
24 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
25 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
26 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
27 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
28 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an

1 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
2 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
3 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
4 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
5 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
6 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
7 invalid for the purposes of this section."
