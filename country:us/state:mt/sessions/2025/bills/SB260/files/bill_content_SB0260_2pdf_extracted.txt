17 an operating school in the district from which it is to be transferred; and

19 proposed transfer by a resolution adopted by a majority of the members of the board of trustees at a meeting
20 for which proper notice was given.

28 (a) provide a legal description of the territory that is requested to be transferred and a description

1 of the district to which the territory is to be transferred;
2 (b) state the reasons why the transfer is requested; and
3 (c) state the number of school-age children residing in the territory.
4 (4) If both the trustees of the receiving and transferring school districts have approved the
5 proposed territory transfer in writing, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer.
6 (5) For any petition that meets the criteria specified in subsection (1) and contains the information
7 required by subsection (3) but that has not been approved in writing by the board of trustees of the school
8 district that would transfer the territory, the county superintendent shall:
9 (a) not more than 40 days after receipt of the petition, set a place, date, and time for a hearing to
10 consider the petition; and

69th Legislature 2025 SB0260.2
1 (IV) WHETHER THERE ARE ISOLATED PUPILS IN THE TERRITORY PROPOSED FOR TRANSFER;
2 (c) the economic viability of the proposed new districts, including but not limited to:
3 (i) the existence of a significant burden on:
4
5 (A) IF THE TRANSFER IS APPROVED, the taxpayers of the district from which the territory will be
6 transferred; OR
7 (B) IF THE TRANSFER IS REJECTED, THE TAXPAYERS OF THE DISTRICT TO WHICH THE TERRITORY IS TO BE
8 TRANSFERRED;
9 (ii) the significance of any loss in state funding for the students in both the receiving and
10 transferring districts;
11 (iii) the viability of the future bonding capacity of the receiving and transferring districts, including
12 but not limited to the ability of the receiving district and the transferring district to meet minimum bonding
13 requirements;
14 (iv) the ability of the receiving district and the transferring district to maintain sufficient reserves;
15 and
16 (v) the cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years on
17 the taxable value of the district from which the territory is to be transferred. In cases where the cumulative effect
18 of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years is equal to or greater than 25% of the
19 district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the decision:
20 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8
21 years;
22 (B) the district's reduction or elimination of instructional staff or programs over the previous 8
23 years; and
24 (C) any increase in district taxes over the previous 8 years and the likely increase in district taxes if
25 the transfer is granted.
26 (7) After receiving evidence from both the proponents and opponents of the proposed territory
27 transfer on the effects described in subsection (6), the county superintendent shall, within 30 days after the
28 hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order.
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – SB 260

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0260.2
1 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
2 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
3 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
4 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
5 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
6 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
7 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
8 shall deny the territory transfer.
9 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
10 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
11 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
12 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section. THE COUNTY
13 SUPERINTENDENT SHALL NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF THE APPROVAL OF A PETITION TO TRANSFER
14 TERRITORY FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER.
15 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
16 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
17 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
18 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
19 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
20 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
21 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
22 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
23 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
24 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
25 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
26 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
27 invalid for the purposes of this section.
28 (12) IF A PETITION TO TRANSFER TERRITORY IS GRANTED UNDER THIS SECTION, FOR THE 3 YEARS

13 COMMISSIONERS SHALL FIX AND LEVY ONE-HALF OF THE NUMBER OF MILLS FOR EACH DISTRICT'S OPERATIONAL LEVIES
14 ON THE FULL TAXABLE VALUE OF ALL PROPERTY WITHIN THE TRANSFERRED TERRITORY.
15 (13) (A) WHEN A PETITION TO TRANSFER TERRITORY HAS BEEN GRANTED FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT
16 HAS PAID A RECONCILIATION PAYMENT TO ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT UNDER [SECTION 12]:
17 (I) THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO WHICH THE TERRITORY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED SHALL BUDGET AND IMPOSE
18 A LEVY FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER TO GENERATE REVENUE EQUAL TO THE MOST RECENT
19 RECONCILIATION PAYMENT IT RECEIVED FROM THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED; AND
20 (II) THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IMPOSING THE LEVY SHALL DEPOSIT THE REVENUE IN ITS TUITION FUND AND PAY
21 THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY WAS TRANSFERRED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE REVENUE RAISED IN
22 SUBSECTION (13)(A)(I) FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER, WITH AT LEAST HALF OF THE ANNUAL
23 PAYMENT MADE BY DECEMBER 31 AND THE REMAINDER BY JUNE 15 OF THE SAME FISCAL YEAR.
24 (B) THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY IS TRANSFERRED SHALL DEPOSIT THE RECEIVED PAYMENT
25 IN ITS FLEXIBILITY FUND OR ALLOCATE IT AMONG ITS BUDGETED FUNDS AS DETERMINED BY THE TRUSTEES."
