determination, including a designation of the number of full-time equivalent isolated pupils enrolled in the district

prior year as approved by the county superintendent pursuant to [section 11(4)] by the mill value per-ANB
amount determined pursuant to subsection (4); and

district pursuant to subsection (4) must be deposited in the tuition fund of the resident school district and used

required by subsection (3) but that has not been approved in writing by the board of trustees of the school

best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring

superintendent shall notify the department of revenue of the approval of a petition to transfer territory from one

the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,

following the transfer:
(a) the taxable value of territory transferred must be divided equally between the school district
from which the territory was transferred and the school district to which the property was transferred;

half of the certified value of the transferred territory in each school district's certified taxable value;
(c) each school district shall calculate the mills required for its district operational levies, as defined

commissioners shall fix and levy one-half of the number of mills for each district's operational levies on the full

reconciliation payment to another school district under [section 12]:
(i) the school district to which the territory has been transferred shall budget and impose a levy for
3 consecutive years following the transfer to generate revenue equal to the most recent reconciliation payment
it received from the district from which the territory has been transferred; and
(ii) the school district imposing the levy shall deposit the revenue in its tuition fund and pay the
district from which the territory was transferred an amount equal to the revenue raised in subsection (13)(a)(i)
for 3 consecutive years following the transfer, with at least half of the annual payment made by December 31
and the remainder by June 15 of the same fiscal year.
(b) The district from which the territory is transferred shall deposit the received payment in its
flexibility fund or allocate it among its budgeted funds as determined by the trustees."
