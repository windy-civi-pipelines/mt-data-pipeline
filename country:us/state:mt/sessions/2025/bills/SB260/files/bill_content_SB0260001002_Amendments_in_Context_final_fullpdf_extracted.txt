1 and
2 (v) the cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years on
3 the taxable value of the district from which the territory is to be transferred. In cases where the cumulative effect
4 of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years is equal to or greater than 25% of the
5 district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the decision:
6 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8
7 years;
8 (B) the district's reduction or elimination of instructional staff or programs over the previous 8
9 years; and
10 (C) any increase in district taxes over the previous 8 years and the likely increase in district taxes if
11 the transfer is granted.
12 (7) After receiving evidence from both the proponents and opponents of the proposed territory
13 transfer on the effects described in subsection (6), the county superintendent shall, within 30 days after the
14 hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order.
15 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
16 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
17 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
18 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
19 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
20 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
21 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
22 shall deny the territory transfer.
23 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
24 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
25 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
26 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section.
27 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
28 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to

1 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
2 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
3 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
4 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
5 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
6 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
7 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
8 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
9 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
10 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
11 invalid for the purposes of this section."

1 consider the petition; and
2 (b) give notice of the place, date, and time of the hearing. The notice must be posted in the
3 districts affected by the petition for the transfer of territory in the manner prescribed in this title for notices for

5 to the board of trustees of the school district from which the territory is to be transferred.
6 (6) The county superintendent shall conduct a hearing as scheduled, and any resident, taxpayer,
7 or representative of the receiving or transferring district must, upon request, be heard. At the hearing, the
8 petitioners have the initial burden of presenting evidence on the proposed transfer's effect on:
9 (a) the educational opportunity for the students in the receiving and transferring districts, including

1 and
2 (v) the cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years on
3 the taxable value of the district from which the territory is to be transferred. In cases where the cumulative effect
4 of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years is equal to or greater than 25% of the
5 district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the decision:
6 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8
7 years;
8 (B) the district's reduction or elimination of instructional staff or programs over the previous 8
9 years; and
10 (C) any increase in district taxes over the previous 8 years and the likely increase in district taxes if
11 the transfer is granted.
12 (7) After receiving evidence from both the proponents and opponents of the proposed territory
13 transfer on the effects described in subsection (6), the county superintendent shall, within 30 days after the
14 hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order.
15 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
16 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
17 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
18 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
19 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
20 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
21 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
22 shall deny the territory transfer.
23 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
24 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
25 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
26 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section.
27 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
28 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to

1 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
2 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
3 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
4 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
5 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
6 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
7 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
8 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
9 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
10 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
11 invalid for the purposes of this section."
