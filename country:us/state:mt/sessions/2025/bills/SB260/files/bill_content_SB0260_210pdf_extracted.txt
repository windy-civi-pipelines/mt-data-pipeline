9 proposed transfer by a resolution adopted by a majority of the members of the board of trustees at a meeting

- 10 - Authorized Print Version – SB 260

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0260.2
1 (b) give notice of the place, date, and time of the hearing. The notice must be posted in the
2 districts affected by the petition for the transfer of territory in the manner prescribed in this title for notices for
3 school elections, with at least one notice posted in the territory to be transferred. Notice must also be delivered
4 to the board of trustees of the school district from which the territory is to be transferred.
5 (6) The county superintendent shall conduct a hearing as scheduled, and any resident, taxpayer,
6 or representative of the receiving or transferring district must, upon request, be heard. At the hearing, the
7 petitioners have the initial burden of presenting evidence on the proposed transfer's effect on:
8 (a) the educational opportunity for the students in the receiving and transferring districts, including
9 but not limited to:
10 (i) class size;
11 (ii) ability to maintain demographic diversity;
12 (iii) local control;
13 (iv) parental involvement; and
14 (v) the capability of the receiving district to provide educational services;
15 (b) student transportation, including but not limited to:
16 (i) safety;
17 (ii) cost; and
18 (iii) travel time of students; AND
19 (IV) WHETHER THERE ARE ISOLATED PUPILS IN THE TERRITORY PROPOSED FOR TRANSFER;

25 TRANSFERRED;
26 (ii) the significance of any loss in state funding for the students in both the receiving and
27 transferring districts;
28 (iii) the viability of the future bonding capacity of the receiving and transferring districts, including
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – SB 260

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0260.2
1 but not limited to the ability of the receiving district and the transferring district to meet minimum bonding
2 requirements;
3 (iv) the ability of the receiving district and the transferring district to maintain sufficient reserves;
4 and
5 (v) the cumulative effect of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years on
6 the taxable value of the district from which the territory is to be transferred. In cases where the cumulative effect
7 of other transfers of territory out of the district in the previous 8 years is equal to or greater than 25% of the
8 district's taxable value, the following additional factors must be considered and weighed in the decision:
9 (A) the district's rate of passage of discretional levies placed before the voters over the previous 8
10 years;
11 (B) the district's reduction or elimination of instructional staff or programs over the previous 8
12 years; and
13 (C) any increase in district taxes over the previous 8 years and the likely increase in district taxes if
14 the transfer is granted.
15 (7) After receiving evidence from both the proponents and opponents of the proposed territory
16 transfer on the effects described in subsection (6), the county superintendent shall, within 30 days after the
17 hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order.
18 (8) If, based on a preponderance of the evidence, the county superintendent determines that the
19 evidence on the effects described in subsection (6) supports a conclusion that a transfer of the territory is in the
20 best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring districts and does not negatively impact
21 the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent shall grant the transfer. If the
22 county superintendent determines that, based on a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, a
23 transfer of the territory is not in the best and collective interest of students in the receiving and transferring
24 districts and will negatively impact the ability of the districts to serve those students, the county superintendent
25 shall deny the territory transfer.
26 (9) The decision of the county superintendent is final 30 days after the date of the decision unless
27 it is appealed to the district court by a resident, taxpayer, or representative of either district affected by the
28 petitioned territory transfer. The county superintendent's decision must be upheld unless the court finds that the
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – SB 260

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0260.2
1 county superintendent's decision constituted an abuse of discretion under this section. THE COUNTY
2 SUPERINTENDENT SHALL NOTIFY THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE OF THE APPROVAL OF A PETITION TO TRANSFER
3 TERRITORY FROM ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER.
4 (10) Whenever a petition to transfer territory from one district to another district creates a joint
5 district or affects the boundary of an existing joint district, the petition to transfer territory must be delivered to
6 the county superintendent of the county in which the territory proposed to be transferred is located. The county
7 superintendent shall notify any other county superintendents of counties with districts affected by the petition,
8 and the duties prescribed in this section for the county superintendent must be performed jointly. If the number
9 of county superintendents involved is an even number, the county superintendents shall jointly appoint an
10 additional county superintendent from an unaffected county to join them in conducting the hearing required in
11 subsection (6) and in issuing the decision required in subsection (8). The decision issued under subsection (8)
12 must be made by a majority of the county superintendents.
13 (11) A petition seeking to transfer territory out of or into a K-12 district must propose the transfer of
14 territory for both elementary and high school purposes. In the case of a proposed transfer out of or into a K-12
15 district, a petition that fails to propose the transfer of territory for both elementary and high school purposes is
16 invalid for the purposes of this section.
17 (12) IF A PETITION TO TRANSFER TERRITORY IS GRANTED UNDER THIS SECTION, FOR THE 3 YEARS
18 IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER:
19 (A) THE TAXABLE VALUE OF TERRITORY TRANSFERRED MUST BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN THE SCHOOL
20 DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY WAS TRANSFERRED AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO WHICH THE PROPERTY WAS
21 TRANSFERRED;
22 (B) WHEN CERTIFYING TAXABLE VALUES PURSUANT TO 15-10-202, THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE SHALL
23 INCLUDE HALF OF THE CERTIFIED VALUE OF THE TRANSFERRED TERRITORY IN EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT'S CERTIFIED
24 TAXABLE VALUE;
25 (C) EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT SHALL CALCULATE THE MILLS REQUIRED FOR ITS DISTRICT OPERATIONAL
26 LEVIES, AS DEFINED IN [SECTION 10], BASED ON THE CERTIFIED TAXABLE VALUE PROVIDED UNDER SUBSECTION (12)(B);
27 AND
28 (D) WHEN LEVYING TAXES FOR DISTRICT OPERATIONAL LEVIES PURSUANT TO 20-9-142, THE COUNTY
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – SB 260

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0260.2
1 COMMISSIONERS SHALL FIX AND LEVY ONE-HALF OF THE NUMBER OF MILLS FOR EACH DISTRICT'S OPERATIONAL LEVIES
2 ON THE FULL TAXABLE VALUE OF ALL PROPERTY WITHIN THE TRANSFERRED TERRITORY.
3 (13) (A) WHEN A PETITION TO TRANSFER TERRITORY HAS BEEN GRANTED FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT
4 HAS PAID A RECONCILIATION PAYMENT TO ANOTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT UNDER [SECTION 12]:
5 (I) THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO WHICH THE TERRITORY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED SHALL BUDGET AND IMPOSE
6 A LEVY FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER TO GENERATE REVENUE EQUAL TO THE MOST RECENT
7 RECONCILIATION PAYMENT IT RECEIVED FROM THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED; AND
8 (II) THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IMPOSING THE LEVY SHALL DEPOSIT THE REVENUE IN ITS TUITION FUND AND PAY
9 THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY WAS TRANSFERRED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE REVENUE RAISED IN
10 SUBSECTION (13)(A)(I) FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER, WITH AT LEAST HALF OF THE ANNUAL
11 PAYMENT MADE BY DECEMBER 31 AND THE REMAINDER BY JUNE 15 OF THE SAME FISCAL YEAR.
12 (B) THE DISTRICT FROM WHICH THE TERRITORY IS TRANSFERRED SHALL DEPOSIT THE RECEIVED PAYMENT
13 IN ITS FLEXIBILITY FUND OR ALLOCATE IT AMONG ITS BUDGETED FUNDS AS DETERMINED BY THE TRUSTEES."
