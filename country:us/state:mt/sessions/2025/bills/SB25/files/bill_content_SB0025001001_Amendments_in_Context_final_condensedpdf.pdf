10
11 WHEREAS, the revolutionary innovations in generative artificial intelligence systems capable of
12 producing image, audio, video, text, and multimedia content pose a threat to free and fair elections in the State
13 of Montana; and
14 WHEREAS, AI-generated content may be used to create deepfakes that falsely depict a candidate's
15 speech or action in order to spread misinformation and disinformation at scale and with unprecedented speed;
16 and
17 WHEREAS, a deepfake is comparable to forcing a person to say or do something in a video recorded
18 under threat, in which the person appears to say or do something the person would not normally say or do; and
19 WHEREAS, a voter's opinion of a candidate may be irreparably tainted by a fabricated representation
20 of an officeholder, incumbent, or candidate saying or doing something the person did not say or do; and
21 WHEREAS, these false, negative portrayals may exist indefinitely once posted on the Internet and
22 permanently damage an officeholder, incumbent, or candidate's reputation and even put the person's safety at
23 risk.
