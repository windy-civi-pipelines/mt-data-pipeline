16 streaming service operator, programmer, or producer, may broadcast an advertisement as part of a bona fide
17 newscast, news interview, news documentary, or on-the-spot coverage of a bona fide news event if the
18 broadcast clearly acknowledges through content or a disclaimer, in a manner that can be easily read or heard,
19 that the advertisement was generated in whole or in part by using artificial intelligence and does not accurately
20 represent the speech or conduct of the depicted individual.
21 (b) A radio or television broadcasting station, including a cable television, satellite television, or
22 streaming service operator, programmer, or producer, may broadcast an advertisement that the station or
23 streaming service is paid to broadcast if the station or streaming service shows that its disclosure requirements
24 are consistent with the requirements provided in subsections (1)(b) and (1)(c) and that it provided those
25 disclosure requirements to each person that purchased the broadcast or streaming of the advertisement.
26 (c) An advertisement that reasonably constitutes satire or parody may be published, posted, or
