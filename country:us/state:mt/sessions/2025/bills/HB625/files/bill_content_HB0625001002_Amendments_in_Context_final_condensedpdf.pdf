11
12 Section 1. Section 15-1-121, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "15-1-121. Entitlement share payment -- purpose -- appropriation. (1) As described in 15-1-
14 120(3), each local government is entitled to an annual amount that is the replacement for revenue received by
15 local governments for diminishment of property tax base and various earmarked fees and other revenue that,
16 pursuant to Chapter 574, Laws of 2001, amended by section 4, Chapter 13, Special Laws of August 2002, and
17 later enactments, were consolidated to provide aggregation of certain reimbursements, fees, tax collections,
18 and other revenue in the state treasury with each local government's share. The reimbursement under this
19 section is provided by direct payment from the state treasury rather than the ad hoc system that offset certain
20 state payments with local government collections due the state and reimbursements made by percentage splits,
21 with a local government remitting a portion of collections to the state, retaining a portion, and in some cases
22 sending a portion to other local governments.
23 (2) The sources of dedicated revenue that were relinquished by local governments in exchange for
24 an entitlement share of the state general fund were:
25 (a) personal property tax reimbursements pursuant to sections 167(1) through (5) and 169(6),
26 Chapter 584, Laws of 1999;
27 (b) vehicle, boat, and aircraft taxes and fees pursuant to:
28 (i) Title 23, chapter 2, part 5;

2 local governments do not include revenue received from tax increment financing districts.
3 (10) When there has been an underpayment of a local government's share of the entitlement share
4 pool, the department shall distribute the difference between the underpayment and the correct amount of the
5 entitlement share. When there has been an overpayment of a local government's entitlement share, the local
6 government shall remit the overpaid amount to the department.
7 (11) A local government may appeal the department's estimation of the base component, the
8 entitlement share growth rate, or a local government's allocation of the entitlement share pool, according to the
9 uniform dispute review procedure in 15-1-211.
10 (12) (a) Except as provided in 2-7-517, a payment required pursuant to this section may not be
11 offset by a debt owed to a state agency by a local government in accordance with Title 17, chapter 4, part 1.
12 (b) A payment required pursuant to this section must be withheld if a local government:
13 (i) fails to meet a deadline established in 2-7-503(1), 7-6-611(2), 7-6-4024(3), or 7-6-4036(1); and
14 (ii) fails to remit any amounts collected on behalf of the state as required by 15-1-504 or as
15 otherwise required by law within 45 days of the end of a month.
16 (c) A payment required pursuant to this section may be withheld if, for more than 90 days, a local
17 government fails to:
18 (i) file a financial report required by 15-1-504;
19 (ii) remit any amounts collected on behalf of the state as required by 15-1-504; or
20 (iii) remit any other amounts owed to the state or another taxing jurisdiction.
21 (d) If the department of revenue receives notice from the attorney general that a county has failed
22 to comply with the reporting requirements of 41-3-210(3), a payment required pursuant to this section must be
23 reduced by 2%."
