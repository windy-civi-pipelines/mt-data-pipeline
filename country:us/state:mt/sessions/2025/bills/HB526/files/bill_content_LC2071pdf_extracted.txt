8
9 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Advance practice registered nurse compact -- enactment --
10 provisions. The advanced practice registered nurse compact is enacted into law and entered into with all
11 jurisdictions legally joining in the compact, in the form substantially as set forth below.
12 ARTICLE I
13 FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF PURPOSE
14 (1) The party states find that:
15 (a) the health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with APRN
16 licensure requirements and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state APRN licensure laws;
17 (b) violations of APRN licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in
18 injury or harm to the public;
19 (c) the expanded mobility of APRNs and the use of advanced communication and intervention
20 technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation
21 among states in the areas of APRN licensure and regulation;
22 (d) new practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state APRN licensure
23 laws difficult and complex;
24 (e) the current system of duplicative APRN licensure for APRNs practicing in multiple states is
25 cumbersome and redundant for health care delivery systems, payors, state licensing boards, regulators, and
26 APRNs; and
27 (f) uniformity of APRN licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and
28 public health benefits as well as providing a mechanism to increase access to care.

7 (d) promote compliance with the laws governing APRN practice in each jurisdiction;
8 (e) invest all party states with the authority to hold an APRN accountable for meeting all state
9 practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual
10 recognition of party state privileges to practice;
11 (f) decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of APRN licenses; and

13 multistate licensure privilege, in the same role and population focus as the APRN is licensed in the home state.
14 (5) Nothing in this compact may affect the requirements established by a party state for the
15 issuance of a single-state license, except that an individual may apply for a single-state license, instead of a
16 multistate license, even if otherwise qualified for the multistate license. However, the failure of such an
17 individual to affirmatively opt for a single-state license may result in the issuance of a multistate license.
18 (6) Issuance of an APRN multistate license must include prescriptive authority for noncontrolled

5 provided. APRN practice is not limited to patient care but must include all advanced nursing practice as defined
6 by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. APRN practice in a party state under a
7 multistate licensure privilege will subject the APRN to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts, and the
8 laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.
9 (11) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this compact, this compact does not affect additional
10 requirements imposed by states for advanced practice registered nursing. However, a multistate licensure
11 privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state must be recognized by other party states as
12 satisfying any state law requirement for registered nurse licensure as a precondition for authorization to practice
13 as an APRN in that state.
14 (12) Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state's
15 single-state APRN license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single-state license

17 party state.

23 the holder of a licensed practical/vocational nursing license, a registered nursing license, or an advanced
24 practice registered nurse license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any
25 license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken
26 against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, and whether the applicant is currently
27 participating in an alternative program.
28 (2) An APRN may hold a multistate APRN license, issued by the home state, in only one party

1 state at a time.
2 (3) If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving between two party states, the APRN

4 must be deactivated in accordance with applicable commission rules.
5 (4) The APRN may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.
6 (5) A multistate APRN license may not be issued by the new home state until the APRN provides
7 satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all
8 applicable requirements to obtain a multistate APRN license from the new home state.
9 (6) If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a nonparty
10 state, the APRN multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid

12 ARTICLE V
13 ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES INVESTED
14 IN PARTY STATE LICENSING BOARDS
15 (1) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the
16 authority to:
17 (a) take adverse action against an APRN's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that
18 party state. Only the home state shall have power to take adverse action against an APRN's license issued by
19 the home state. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same
20 priority and effect to reported conduct that occurred outside of the home state as it would if such conduct had
21 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine
22 appropriate action.
23 (b) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on an APRN's authority to practice
24 within that party state;
25 (c) complete any pending investigations of an APRN who changes primary state of residence
26 during the course of such investigations. The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate
27 action or actions and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the
28 coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system
- 8 - LC 2071
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2071
1 shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.
2 (d) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and
3 testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a party state licensing
4 board for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and/or the production of evidence from another party state
5 must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to that court's practice and
6 procedure in considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing licensing board shall pay any
7 witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the
8 witnesses and/or evidence are located.
9 (e) obtain and submit, for an APRN licensure applicant, fingerprints or other biometric-based
10 information to the federal bureau of investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the
11 federal bureau of investigation record search on criminal background checks, and use the results in making
12 licensure decisions;
13 (f) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected APRN the costs of investigations
14 and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that APRN; and
15 (g) take adverse action based on the factual findings of another party state, provided that the
16 licensing board follow its own procedures for taking such adverse action.
17 (2) If adverse action is taken by a home state against an APRN's multistate licensure, the privilege
18 to practice in all other party states under a multistate licensure privilege must be deactivated until all
19 encumbrances have been removed from the APRN's multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that
20 impose adverse action against an APRN's multistate license must include a statement that the APRN's
21 multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.
22 (3) Nothing in this compact may override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative
23 program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate
24 licensure privilege under the multistate license of any APRN for the duration of the APRN's participation in an
25 alternative program.

15 contributing state.
16 (5) Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information
17 system by a party state licensing board may not be shared with nonparty states or disclosed to other entities or

5 COMPACT; PROVIDING RULEMAKING AUTHORITY; AND PROVIDING DEFINITIONS.”
6
7 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
8
9 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Advance practice registered nurse compact -- enactment --
10 provisions. The advanced practice registered nurse compact is enacted into law and entered into with all
11 jurisdictions legally joining in the compact, in the form substantially as set forth below.
12 ARTICLE I
13 FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF PURPOSE
14 (1) The party states find that:
15 (a) the health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with APRN
16 licensure requirements and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to state APRN licensure laws;
17 (b) violations of APRN licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in
18 injury or harm to the public;
19 (c) the expanded mobility of APRNs and the use of advanced communication and intervention
20 technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation
21 among states in the areas of APRN licensure and regulation;
22 (d) new practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state APRN licensure
23 laws difficult and complex;
24 (e) the current system of duplicative APRN licensure for APRNs practicing in multiple states is
25 cumbersome and redundant for health care delivery systems, payors, state licensing boards, regulators, and
26 APRNs; and
27 (f) uniformity of APRN licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and
28 public health benefits as well as providing a mechanism to increase access to care.

69th Legislature 2025 LC 2071
1 (2) The general purposes of this compact are to:

4 regulation, including promotion of uniform licensure requirements;
5 (c) facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of APRN regulation,
6 investigation, and adverse actions;
7 (d) promote compliance with the laws governing APRN practice in each jurisdiction;
8 (e) invest all party states with the authority to hold an APRN accountable for meeting all state
9 practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual
10 recognition of party state privileges to practice;
11 (f) decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of APRN licenses; and

13 requirements.

6 (l) is subject to self-disclosure requirements regarding current participation in an alternative
7 program; and
8 (m) has a valid United States social security number.
9 (3) An APRN issued a multistate license shall be licensed in an approved role and at least one
10 approved population focus.
11 (4) An APRN multistate license issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be
12 recognized by each party state as authorizing the APRN to practice as an APRN in each party state, under a
13 multistate licensure privilege, in the same role and population focus as the APRN is licensed in the home state.
14 (5) Nothing in this compact may affect the requirements established by a party state for the
15 issuance of a single-state license, except that an individual may apply for a single-state license, instead of a
16 multistate license, even if otherwise qualified for the multistate license. However, the failure of such an
17 individual to affirmatively opt for a single-state license may result in the issuance of a multistate license.
18 (6) Issuance of an APRN multistate license must include prescriptive authority for noncontrolled
19 prescription drugs.
20 (7) For each state in which an APRN seeks authority to prescribe controlled substances, the APRN
21 shall satisfy all requirements imposed by such state in granting and/or renewing such authority.
22 (8) An APRN issued a multistate license is authorized to assume responsibility and accountability

25 (9) All party states must be authorized, in accordance with state due process laws, to take adverse
26 action against an APRN's multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation, or any other

28 and desist actions. If a party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the coordinated

3 (10) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this compact, an APRN practicing in a party state
4 shall comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is
5 provided. APRN practice is not limited to patient care but must include all advanced nursing practice as defined
6 by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. APRN practice in a party state under a
7 multistate licensure privilege will subject the APRN to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts, and the
8 laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.
9 (11) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this compact, this compact does not affect additional
10 requirements imposed by states for advanced practice registered nursing. However, a multistate licensure
11 privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state must be recognized by other party states as
12 satisfying any state law requirement for registered nurse licensure as a precondition for authorization to practice
13 as an APRN in that state.
14 (12) Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state's
15 single-state APRN license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single-state license
16 granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice as an APRN in any other
17 party state.
18 ARTICLE IV
19 APPLICATIONS FOR APRN
20 LICENSURE IN A PARTY STATE
21 (1) Upon application for an APRN multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state
22 shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is
23 the holder of a licensed practical/vocational nursing license, a registered nursing license, or an advanced
24 practice registered nurse license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any
25 license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken
26 against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, and whether the applicant is currently
27 participating in an alternative program.
28 (2) An APRN may hold a multistate APRN license, issued by the home state, in only one party
- 7 - LC 2071

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2071
1 state at a time.
2 (3) If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving between two party states, the APRN
3 shall apply for APRN licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state
4 must be deactivated in accordance with applicable commission rules.
5 (4) The APRN may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.
6 (5) A multistate APRN license may not be issued by the new home state until the APRN provides
7 satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all
8 applicable requirements to obtain a multistate APRN license from the new home state.
9 (6) If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a nonparty
10 state, the APRN multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid
11 only in the former home state.
12 ARTICLE V
13 ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES INVESTED
14 IN PARTY STATE LICENSING BOARDS
15 (1) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the
16 authority to:
17 (a) take adverse action against an APRN's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that
18 party state. Only the home state shall have power to take adverse action against an APRN's license issued by
19 the home state. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same
20 priority and effect to reported conduct that occurred outside of the home state as it would if such conduct had
21 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine
22 appropriate action.
23 (b) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on an APRN's authority to practice
24 within that party state;
25 (c) complete any pending investigations of an APRN who changes primary state of residence
26 during the course of such investigations. The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate
27 action or actions and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the
28 coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system
- 8 - LC 2071

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2071
1 shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.
2 (d) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and
3 testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a party state licensing
4 board for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and/or the production of evidence from another party state
5 must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to that court's practice and
6 procedure in considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing licensing board shall pay any
7 witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the
8 witnesses and/or evidence are located.
9 (e) obtain and submit, for an APRN licensure applicant, fingerprints or other biometric-based
10 information to the federal bureau of investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the
11 federal bureau of investigation record search on criminal background checks, and use the results in making
12 licensure decisions;
13 (f) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected APRN the costs of investigations
14 and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that APRN; and
15 (g) take adverse action based on the factual findings of another party state, provided that the
16 licensing board follow its own procedures for taking such adverse action.
17 (2) If adverse action is taken by a home state against an APRN's multistate licensure, the privilege
18 to practice in all other party states under a multistate licensure privilege must be deactivated until all
19 encumbrances have been removed from the APRN's multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that
20 impose adverse action against an APRN's multistate license must include a statement that the APRN's
21 multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.
22 (3) Nothing in this compact may override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative
23 program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate
24 licensure privilege under the multistate license of any APRN for the duration of the APRN's participation in an
25 alternative program.
