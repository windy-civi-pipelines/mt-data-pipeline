14 WHEREAS, in 2023, the Department of Labor and Industry was charged with the responsibility of
15 receiving complaints from citizens in the state and with disciplining licensed property managers for violations of
16 professional conduct; and
17 WHEREAS, the Department of Labor and Industry is authorized to create rules and regulations for
