MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY OF THE LICENSING STANDARDS, EDUCATION, AND
PRACTICES OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT IN THE STATE; AND REQUIRING THAT THE RESULTS OF
THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, residential and commercial landowners hire property managers to manage landowners'
properties throughout the state; and
WHEREAS, to manage these properties, property managers are required to obtain a license that
requires education and training approved by the Department of Labor and Industry; and
WHEREAS, in 2023, the Department of Labor and Industry was charged with the responsibility of
receiving complaints from citizens in the state and with disciplining licensed property managers for violations of
professional conduct; and
WHEREAS, the Department of Labor and Industry is authorized to create rules and regulations for
professional practice with respect to the licensing of property managers, but professional practice is limited in
requiring property managers to comply with the responsibilities of the Montana Residential Landlord and Tenant
Act and commercial rental contract law in the state; and
WHEREAS, the state recognizes the importance of property managers to provide services to both
landowners and tenants with respect to the rental of property; and
WHEREAS, these services are received at a cost, and the costs, which are not monitored or regulated,
have affected both landowners and tenants as an increase in rental prices in the state; and
WHEREAS, the state has recognized that foreign corporations and foreign investment groups are not
required to have licensed and regulated property managers overseeing rental properties, thus reducing the
quality of those rental properties.
