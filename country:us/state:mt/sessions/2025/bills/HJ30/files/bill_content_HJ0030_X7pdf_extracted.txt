Section 1:
69th Legislature HJ 30
MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY OF METHODS TO INCREASE HOUSING DENSITY AND
AFFORDABILITY; AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE
70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, Montana communities are in dire need of quality housing supported by sustainable
infrastructure, including housing for workers, new families, people seeking to age in place, and people seeking
entry-level homes; and
WHEREAS, state government, local governments, and housing developers have a mutual
responsibility to investigate paths for addressing the lack of housing in Montana; and
WHEREAS, increasing housing density and building workforce housing, starter homes, and homes for
people aging in place requires meaningful partnerships between developers and local governments and a
buyer market with the financial means to purchase newly developed homes; and
WHEREAS, increasing housing density also increases the overall taxable value for each acre of
housing developments while reducing the tax burden on individual home owners residing within the
development; and
WHEREAS, the Governor's bipartisan housing task force has prioritized policies that encourage
housing density and the development of housing that is attainable at every income level.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
committee, pursuant to section 5-5-217, MCA, or direct sufficient staff resources to:
