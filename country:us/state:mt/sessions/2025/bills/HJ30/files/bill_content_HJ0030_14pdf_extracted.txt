1 HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 30
3
4 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
5 MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY OF METHODS TO INCREASE HOUSING DENSITY AND
6 AFFORDABILITY; AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE
7 70TH LEGISLATURE.
8
9 WHEREAS, Montana communities are in dire need of quality housing supported by sustainable
10 infrastructure, including housing for workers, new families, people seeking to age in place, and people seeking
11 entry-level homes; and
12 WHEREAS, state government, local governments, and housing developers have a mutual
13 responsibility to investigate paths for addressing the lack of housing in Montana; and
14 WHEREAS, increasing housing density and building workforce housing, starter homes, and homes for
15 people aging in place requires meaningful partnerships between developers and local governments and a
16 buyer market with the financial means to purchase newly developed homes; and
17 WHEREAS, increasing housing density also increases the overall taxable value for each acre of
18 housing developments while reducing the tax burden on individual home owners residing within the
19 development; and
20 WHEREAS, the Governor's bipartisan housing task force has prioritized policies that encourage
21 housing density and the development of housing that is attainable at every income level.

7 wastewater systems; and
8 (5) investigate methods or programs to encourage greater density in housing developments that
