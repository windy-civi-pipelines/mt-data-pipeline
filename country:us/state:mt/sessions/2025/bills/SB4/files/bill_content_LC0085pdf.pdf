4 improvements. To be eligible for the exemption, applicants must meet the requirements of this section.
5 (2) If the total appraised value of the land is equal to or less than 150% of the appraised value of
6 the primary residence and improvements situated on the land, then the land exemption provided in this section
7 does not apply.
8 (3) Subject to subsection (6), if the total appraised value of the land is greater than 150% of the
9 appraised value of the primary residence and improvements situated on the land, then the land is valued at

11 minimum equalization of value requirement in subsection (4), and the remainder of the land value is exempt
12 from taxation.

14 value of land, then the value of the land may not be reduced in an amount that is less than the statewide
15 average value of land multiplied by the acreage of land for the subject property.
16 (5) This section does not provide an exemption for the primary residence and improvements

21 30 days from the date of the classification and appraisal notice will be applicable only for the second year of the
22 2-year valuation cycle. After an exemption is approved, the applicant remains eligible for the exemption for the
23 remainder of the 2-year valuation cycle as long as the property is continually used as a primary residence by
24 the applicant. An applicant who does not apply for assistance during the first year of the valuation cycle may
25 apply no later than March 1 of the second year of the cycle.
26 (b) The application form must contain:
27 (i) an affirmation that the applicant owns and maintains the land and improvements as the primary

16 manufactured home is located, but only if the mobile or manufactured home and the land are both owned by
