3 convicted;

5 claimant's own conduct cause or bring about the conviction. A confession or admission that is later found to be
6 false or a guilty plea that is withdrawn does not constitute committing perjury, fabricating evidence, or causing
7 or bringing about the conviction, and 45-7-201 does not apply.
8 (c) that the claimant's conviction was reversed or vacated and either the claimant was not retried
9 and the charges were dismissed, or the claimant was retried and was found not guilty, and the basis for
10 reversing or vacating the conviction was not legal error unrelated to factual innocence, and the claimant is not
11 still subject to prosecution for the same crime or a lesser included offense of the same crime.
12 (6) The court, in exercising its discretion regarding the weight and admissibility of evidence
13 submitted under this section, may in the interest of justice give due consideration to difficulties of proof caused
14 by the passage of time, the death or unavailability of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or other factors not
15 caused by claimants, the state, the county of conviction, or those acting on their behalf.
16 (7) If the court finds that the claimant is entitled to judgment, the court shall enter a certificate of
17 innocence finding that the claimant is innocent of all crimes for which the claimant was mistakenly convicted.

19 department of justice and the county of conviction for payment pursuant to [sections 1 through 8].
20 (8) The decision of the district court may be appealed directly to the supreme court.
21

25 whether the claimant has prior criminal convictions in other cases that are not the subject of the claim for
26 compensation.
27 (2) The order of expungement must state:
28 (a) the claimant's current full name;

7 rendered the conviction.
8 (3) The order of expungement also must direct the department of justice to purge the conviction
9 and arrest information from the central repository of the criminal justice information network and all applicable
10 databases. The clerk of the court shall send a certified copy of the order to the department of justice for
11 immediate action, and the department shall carry out the order and notify the federal bureau of investigation,
12 the department of corrections, and any other criminal justice agency that may have a record of the conviction
13 and arrest. The department of justice shall provide confirmation of the action to the court.
14 (4) If a certificate of innocence and an order of expungement are entered, the claimant must be
15 treated as not having been arrested or convicted of the crime or crimes to which the certificate of innocence
16 applies.
17 (5) (a) Upon entry of a certificate of innocence:
18 (i) the court shall order the expungement and destruction of any associated biological samples
19 from the claimant. The order must state the information required to be expunged and destroyed.
20 (ii) the court shall seal all district court records regarding the conviction. The district court records
21 are only available upon a good cause finding by the court.
22 (iii) the clerk of the court shall send a certified copy of the order to the department of justice, which
23 must carry out the order and provide confirmation of the action to the court.
24 (b) The department is not required to expunge and destroy any samples record associated with
25 the claimant related to an offense other than the offense or offenses for which the court has entered a
26 certificate of innocence.
27 (6) The decision to grant or deny a certificate of innocence does not have a res judicata effect on
28 any other criminal proceedings involving the claimant.
