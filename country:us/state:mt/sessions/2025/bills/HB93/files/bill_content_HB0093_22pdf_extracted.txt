26
27 NEW SECTION. Section 3. Election of remedies. (1) (a) Except as provided in subsection (1)(b), to

- 2 - Authorized Print Version – HB 93
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0093.2
1 causes of action, and other forms of relief or compensation against the state, any political subdivision of the
2 state and their officers, employees, agents, and volunteers related to the claimant's wrongful conviction and
3 imprisonment. This waiver includes all state, common law, and federal claims for relief, including claims
4 pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1983. The claimant shall execute a release of all claims against the state, any political
5 subdivision of the state, and their officers, employees, agents, and volunteers arising from the facts contained
6 in the petition prior to the payment of any damages or compensation or the receipt of a rental voucher under
7 46-23-1041. For the purposes of any insurance claim made for this type of claim, the date of exoneration
8 DISPOSITION is the occurrence date.
9
10 (b) If a claim filed pursuant to [sections 1 through 8] is denied, the claimant is not subject to the
11 restrictions as described in subsection (1)(a) and the waiver is void and may not be enforced.
12 (2) An individual who has a legal proceeding pending or in which judgment has been entered in
13 state or federal court seeking damages or relief for wrongful conviction or imprisonment based on facts that
14 could establish a cognizable claim pursuant to [sections 1 through 8] may not bring a claim under [section 2].
15
16 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Commencement of proceedings -- burden of proof. (1) A claimant is
17 entitled to a hearing in district court as expeditiously as possible after filing a claim for compensation.
18 (2) A claim filed pursuant to [sections 1 through 8] must be served on the department of justice

4 guilty plea that is withdrawn does not constitute committing perjury, fabricating evidence, or causing or bringing
5 about the conviction, and 45-7-201 does not apply.
6 (c) the claimant's conviction was reversed or vacated and either the claimant was not retried and
7 the charges were dismissed, or the claimant was retried and was found not guilty, and the basis for reversing or
8 vacating the conviction was not legal error unrelated to factual innocence.
9 (6) The court, in exercising its discretion regarding the weight and admissibility of evidence
10 submitted under this section, may in the interest of justice give due consideration to difficulties of proof caused
11 by the passage of time, the death or unavailability of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or other factors not
12 caused by claimants, the state, the county of conviction, or those acting on their behalf.
13 (7) If the court finds that the claimant is entitled to judgment, the court shall enter a certificate of
14 innocence finding that the claimant is innocent of all crimes for which the claimant was mistakenly convicted.

16 department of justice and the county of conviction for payment pursuant to [sections 1 through 8].

20 shall order the associated convictions and arrest records expunged and purged from all applicable systems,
21 including both electronic and hard copy systems. The court shall enter the expungement order regardless of
22 whether the claimant has prior criminal convictions in other cases that are not the subject of the claim for
23 compensation.

8 immediate action, and the department shall carry out the order and notify the federal bureau of investigation,
9 the department of corrections, and any other criminal justice agency that may have a record of the conviction
10 and arrest. The department of justice shall provide confirmation of the action to the court.
11 (4) If a certificate of innocence and an order of expungement are entered, the claimant must be
12 treated as not having been arrested or convicted of the crime or crimes to which the certificate of innocence
13 applies.
14 (5) (a) Upon entry of a certificate of innocence:
15 (i) the court shall order the expungement and destruction of any associated biological samples
16 from the claimant. The order must state the information required to be expunged and destroyed.
17 (ii) the court shall seal all district court records regarding the conviction. The district court records

22 the claimant related to an offense other than the offense or offenses for which the court has entered a

25 any other criminal proceedings involving the claimant.

25 (5) The claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that:
26 (a) the claimant did not commit the crime or crimes for which the claimant was convicted, did not
27 aid, abet, or act as an accomplice or accessory to a person who committed the acts that were the basis of the

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0093.2
1 convicted;
2 (b) the claimant did not commit perjury under 45-7-201, fabricate evidence, or by the claimant's
3 own conduct cause or bring about the conviction. A confession or admission that is later found to be false or a
4 guilty plea that is withdrawn does not constitute committing perjury, fabricating evidence, or causing or bringing
5 about the conviction, and 45-7-201 does not apply.
6 (c) the claimant's conviction was reversed or vacated and either the claimant was not retried and
7 the charges were dismissed, or the claimant was retried and was found not guilty, and the basis for reversing or

9 (6) The court, in exercising its discretion regarding the weight and admissibility of evidence

12 caused by claimants, the state, the county of conviction, or those acting on their behalf.
13 (7) If the court finds that the claimant is entitled to judgment, the court shall enter a certificate of
14 innocence finding that the claimant is innocent of all crimes for which the claimant was mistakenly convicted.

16 department of justice and the county of conviction for payment pursuant to [sections 1 through 8].

22 whether the claimant has prior criminal convictions in other cases that are not the subject of the claim for

2 (e) the date of the claimant's arrest and the date of the claimant's conviction; and
3 (f) the identity of the arresting law enforcement authority and the identity of the district court that
4 rendered the conviction.
5 (3) The order of expungement also must direct the department of justice to purge the conviction
6 and arrest information from the central repository of the criminal justice information network and all applicable
7 databases. The clerk of the court shall send a certified copy of the order to the department of justice for
8 immediate action, and the department shall carry out the order and notify the federal bureau of investigation,
9 the department of corrections, and any other criminal justice agency that may have a record of the conviction
10 and arrest. The department of justice shall provide confirmation of the action to the court.
11 (4) If a certificate of innocence and an order of expungement are entered, the claimant must be
12 treated as not having been arrested or convicted of the crime or crimes to which the certificate of innocence
13 applies.
14 (5) (a) Upon entry of a certificate of innocence:
15 (i) the court shall order the expungement and destruction of any associated biological samples
16 from the claimant. The order must state the information required to be expunged and destroyed.
17 (ii) the court shall seal all district court records regarding the conviction. The district court records
18 are only available upon a good cause finding by the court.
19 (iii) the clerk of the court shall send a certified copy of the order to the department of justice, which
20 must carry out the order and provide confirmation of the action to the court.
21 (b) The department is not required to expunge and destroy any samples record associated with
22 the claimant related to an offense other than the offense or offenses for which the court has entered a
23 certificate of innocence.
24 (6) The decision to grant or deny a certificate of innocence does not have a res judicata effect on
25 any other criminal proceedings involving the claimant.
