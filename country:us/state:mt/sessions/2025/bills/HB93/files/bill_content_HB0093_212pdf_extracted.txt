1 remedies, causes of action, and other forms of relief or compensation against the state, any political subdivision
2 of the state and their officers, employees, agents, and volunteers related to the claimant's wrongful conviction

9 (b) If a claim filed pursuant to [sections 1 through 8] is denied, the claimant is not subject to the
10 restrictions as described in subsection (1)(a) and the waiver is void and may not be enforced.
11 (2) An individual who has a legal proceeding pending or in which judgment has been entered in
12 state or federal court seeking damages or relief for wrongful conviction or imprisonment based on facts that

4 about the conviction, and 45-7-201 does not apply.
5 (c) the claimant's conviction was reversed or vacated and either the claimant was not retried and
6 the charges were dismissed, or the claimant was retried and was found not guilty, and the basis for reversing or

11 caused by claimants, the state, the county of conviction, or those acting on their behalf.

13 innocence finding that the claimant is innocent of all crimes for which the claimant was mistakenly convicted.

7 immediate action, and the department shall carry out the order and notify the federal bureau of investigation,
8 the department of corrections, and any other criminal justice agency that may have a record of the conviction
9 and arrest. The department of justice shall provide confirmation of the action to the court.
10 (4) If a certificate of innocence and an order of expungement are entered, the claimant must be
11 treated as not having been arrested or convicted of the crime or crimes to which the certificate of innocence
12 applies.
