10 DISPOSITION is the occurrence date.
11 (b) If a claim filed pursuant to [sections 1 through 8] is denied, the claimant is not subject to the
12 restrictions as described in subsection (1)(a) and the waiver is void and may not be enforced.
13 (2) An individual who has a legal proceeding pending or in which judgment has been entered in
14 state or federal court seeking damages or relief for wrongful conviction or imprisonment based on facts that
15 could establish a cognizable claim pursuant to [sections 1 through 8] may not bring a claim under [section 2].

3 convicted;
4 (b) the claimant did not commit perjury under 45-7-201, fabricate evidence, or by the claimant's
5 own conduct cause or bring about the conviction. A confession or admission that is later found to be false or a

7 about the conviction, and 45-7-201 does not apply.
8 (c) the claimant's conviction was reversed or vacated and either the claimant was not retried and
9 the charges were dismissed, or the claimant was retried and was found not guilty, and the basis for reversing or
10 vacating the conviction was not legal error unrelated to factual innocence.

12 submitted under this section, may in the interest of justice give due consideration to difficulties of proof caused
13 by the passage of time, the death or unavailability of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or other factors not
14 caused by claimants, the state, the county of conviction, or those acting on their behalf.
15 (7) If the court finds that the claimant is entitled to judgment, the court shall enter a certificate of
16 innocence finding that the claimant is innocent of all crimes for which the claimant was mistakenly convicted.
17 The clerk of the court shall send a certified copy of the certificate of innocence and the judgment to the
18 department of justice and the county of conviction for payment pursuant to [sections 1 through 8].
19 (8) The decision of the district court may be appealed directly to the supreme court.
20

22 shall order the associated convictions and arrest records expunged and purged from all applicable systems,
23 including both electronic and hard copy systems. The court shall enter the expungement order regardless of
24 whether the claimant has prior criminal convictions in other cases that are not the subject of the claim for
25 compensation.
26 (2) The order of expungement must state:
27 (a) the claimant's current full name;

9 and arrest information from the central repository of the criminal justice information network and all applicable
10 databases. The clerk of the court shall send a certified copy of the order to the department of justice for
11 immediate action, and the department shall carry out the order and notify the federal bureau of investigation,
12 the department of corrections, and any other criminal justice agency that may have a record of the conviction
13 and arrest. The department of justice shall provide confirmation of the action to the court.
14 (4) If a certificate of innocence and an order of expungement are entered, the claimant must be
15 treated as not having been arrested or convicted of the crime or crimes to which the certificate of innocence
16 applies.
17 (5) (a) Upon entry of a certificate of innocence:
18 (i) the court shall order the expungement and destruction of any associated biological samples
19 from the claimant. The order must state the information required to be expunged and destroyed.
20 (ii) the court shall seal all district court records regarding the conviction. The district court records
21 are only available upon a good cause finding by the court.
22 (iii) the clerk of the court shall send a certified copy of the order to the department of justice, which

25 the claimant related to an offense other than the offense or offenses for which the court has entered a
