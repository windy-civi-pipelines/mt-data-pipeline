3 (4) "Claimant" means a person bringing an asbestos action, including a personal representative if
4 the asbestos action is brought by an estate, or a conservator or next friend if the asbestos action is brought on
5 behalf of a minor or incapacitated person, as defined in sections 41-1-101 and 72-5-101.
6 (5) "Exposed person" means a person whose exposure to asbestos or to asbestos-containing

19 asbestos action is filed, the claimant shall do all of the following:
20 (a) provide the court and parties with a sworn statement signed by the claimant and claimant’s
21 counsel indicating that an investigation has been conducted and that all asbestos trust claims that can be made

26 (b) provide all parties with all trust claim materials from all law firms connected to the claimant in
27 relation to exposure to asbestos, including trust claim materials that relate to conditions other than those that
28 are the basis for the asbestos action; and
