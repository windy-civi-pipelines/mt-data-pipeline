RE: Formal Request to Veto House Bill 547
Dear Governor Gianforte,
On behalf of the hundreds of volunteer firefighters and rural fire district trustees across
Montana, I respectfully urge you to veto House Bill 547 upon its arrival to your desk.
Though presented as a statewide solution, HB 547 is rooted in a local dispute in Butte-Silver
Bow County. Rather than resolving those tensions through local collaboration or charter revision,
the bill proposes sweeping changes that threaten to destabilize rural fire protection across the
state.
Key Concerns:
• Local Problem, Statewide Damage: HB 547 was designed to address governance
friction between the paid fire department and volunteer districts in Butte-Silver Bow. But
it strips critical protections from all fire districts in any consolidated city-county.
• Volunteers Excluded: Volunteer companies were given less than 24 hours' notice for the
House hearing. Our repeated requests to collaborate with the paid chief were ignored.
• No Local Mandate: The Butte-Silver Bow County Commission did not request this
legislation and has not voted to support it. Their local charter—currently open for
revisions—already offers a process to address fire governance issues.
• Creates Uncertainty: HB 547 offers no plan for volunteer chiefs, stations, equipment,
mutual aid, or funding in future consolidations. It introduces more questions than answers
and will likely force levies to hire more paid firefighters if volunteers walk away.
• Safety & Liability Concerns Unaddressed: The bill contains no language that
improves fire safety or clarifies liability. Fire districts are already distinct legal entities
under Montana law—able to sue or be sued independently. The liability structure is
unchanged.
The Broader Threat:
By undermining the authority and autonomy of rural volunteer fire districts, HB 547 sets a
dangerous precedent. If passed, it will invite further erosion of rural protections in future
sessions, weakening the very backbone of Montana’s emergency response network.
Your Leadership Matters:
Governor, we know your commitment to rural Montana runs deep. This is a moment to affirm
that local solutions—not top-down mandates—are the best way to address local problems. We
ask you to stand with the rural departments and volunteer responders who protect our farms,
towns, and highways.
Please veto HB 547.
Sincerely,
Kevin Moritz

Re: House Bill 547 – Legal Concerns and Request for Executive Action
Dear Lieutenant Governor Juras,
I am writing to express my strong concerns regarding House Bill 547 and its implications for fire districts
in Butte-Silver Bow and across Montana. As legal counsel for several rural fire districts within Butte-
Silver Bow, and as an attorney who has spent years advising fire service organizations on statutory
compliance and governance, I can state with confidence that this bill does not address the underlying
problems it purports to resolve. Rather, it creates new confusion, strips statutory protections, and
introduces significant legal uncertainty.
Although the bill’s sponsor has asserted that HB 547 will enhance training, operational authority, and
public safety, there is nothing in the bill’s text that addresses any of these issues. The bill is silent on
matters of chain of command, interagency coordination, training standards, or public safety protocols.
Instead, it removes language from §§ 7-33-2110 and 7-33-2316, MCA, that has served as a crucial
protection for fire districts in consolidated governments, language that has been deliberately preserved
through numerous legislative sessions.
Importantly, HB 547 is not retroactive. This raises an even more complex legal question: under what
statutory scheme do the pre-consolidation fire districts in Butte-Silver Bow now operate? Do they retain
their original authority under Title 7, Chapter 33, Part 21, or are they somehow subject to undefined local
control without statutory guidance? This ambiguity will lead to conflict, potential litigation, and confusion
for fire district boards of trustees, fire chiefs, volunteers, and the communities they serve.
The respected Senate Local Government Committee Chair summarized the issue well when he stated
that this bill is “asking us to pick winners and losers in this local issue.”** That is exactly what HB 547
does. It removes protections without establishing a path forward. It mandates a centralized fire chief
under the consolidated government, without stating what happens to existing rural fire district chiefs,
Boards of Trustees, or their legally acquired assets and taxing authority. Will volunteers continue to serve
if their chiefs are removed and their operations absorbed into a larger department? If not, communities
may be forced to replace those services with full-time paid firefighters, resulting in significant tax
increases.
This bill was introduced without adequate stakeholder input. The fire districts were given only 24 hours’
notice before the bill’s hearing, cutting short productive discussions with Butte-Silver Bow officials that
had been ongoing for months. HB 547 destroyed the trust necessary for collaborative problem-solving.
However, I want to emphasize that if this bill is vetoed, every Butte-Silver Bow fire district representative
has committed to returning to the table. They are willing to work directly with Butte-Silver Bow’s
government to resolve local governance challenges in good faith. If, after two years, legislative
clarification is still needed, then both sides could return to the Legislature on equal footing, with a shared
understanding of the issues and ample opportunity for public input.
I respectfully request that you raise these concerns with Governor Gianforte and urge him to carefully
consider a veto of HB 547. Doing so would preserve long-standing statutory protections, allow for local
resolution, and maintain public trust. A veto would not be a rejection of progress; it would be a
reaffirmation of thoughtful, inclusive policymaking that engages the people most affected by these
decisions.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I would be happy to speak further with your office or provide
additional legal analysis at your request.
Sincerely,
Catherine L. Dinwiddie,
Attorney at Law

Senate Floor Hearing:
Senator Forrest Mandeville: “Thank you Mr. Chair, members of the committee. So first I want to agree with my
friend from Butte. This is a Butte issue, this is very much a Butte issue, this is only a Butte issue. This is not an
issue anywhere else in the state. This is an issue that Butte got themselves into and they are asking us to pick sides,
to bail Butte out of their issue. This is an issue with the Butte Charter that's where their concern is. We should not
be involved in the Butte Charter. The Butte Charter issue is not something for the state legislature in Helena to be
involved with. Not something for someone from Columbus to be involved with. I don't want anything to do with
the Butte Charter. I'm not from Butte, sounds like a great place but I'm not from there. It is a great place. I've been
there not taking anything away from Butte but more communication locally is what's going to solve this. It's going
to help solve this. What we heard in committee and we had a great committee meeting. There were a lot of
firefighters from Butte. I'm actually very glad that there was not an emergency or a fire in Butte that day because
we had probably most of their firefighters in Helena but what I took out of it was there was not enough
communication. Not enough people involved early on locally to come to an agreement on this and what was
happening was there's one side that was coming up to Helena and asking us to pick winners and losers in this local
issue and try to move it forward to solve their issue. We should not be in a position of mediating on these local
issues. This has been going on you heard the carrier say for 46 years. We can wait another two. You can wait
another two for the locals to get together, come to an agreement, work this out and then come back to us with a
clean up if that's necessary. This does pick winners and losers. The carrier said that they need this bill to put Butte-
Silver Bow Fire under single leadership. You know what that means, that is going to take away power from the
Volunteer Fire districts that's what this bill will do. So I'm a no on the bill. I hope you will be also. Let's give Butte-
Silver Bow the chance to come together and come up with a cleanup bill that they can all agree on before we're
asked to pick sides.”
