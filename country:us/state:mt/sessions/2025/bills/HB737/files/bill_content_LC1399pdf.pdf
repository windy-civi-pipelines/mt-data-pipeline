9 (2) (a) A person subject to subsection (1) may apply to the district court for the county in which the
10 person resides for a permit to purchase and possess one or more firearms. The person shall show good cause
11 for the possession of each firearm sought to be purchased and possessed. The grant or denial of the

13 another application may not be made for the next 12 months.
14 (b) The application must contain the following information:
15 (i) the person's full name and any past or present aliases;
