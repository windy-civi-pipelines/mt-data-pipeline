3 (2) Nothing in this compact, nor any rule of the commission, may be construed to limit, restrict, or
4 in any way reduce the ability of a member state to take adverse action against a licensee's single-state license
5 to practice massage therapy in that state.

1 (a) take adverse actions against a licensee's authorization to practice;
2 (b) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a licensee's authorization to
3 practice in that state;
4 (c) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and
5 testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing authority in a
6 member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another
7 member state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
8 practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings before it. The issuing
9 licensing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service
10 statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
11 (d) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected licensee the costs of

18 orders that impose an adverse action against a licensee must include a statement that the massage therapist's

21 adverse action applies to all authorizations to practice in all remote states. A licensee whose authorization to
22 practice in a remote state is removed for a specified period of time is not eligible to apply for a new multistate
23 license in any other state until the specific time for removal of the authorization to practice has passed and all
24 encumbrance requirements are satisfied.
25 (8) Nothing in this compact may override a member state's authority to accept a licensee's
26 participation in an alternative program in lieu of adverse action. A licensee's multistate license must be
27 suspended for the duration of the licensee's participation in any alternative program.

1 (1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
2 implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule may be invalid and have no force
3 or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission exercised
4 its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers
5 granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
6 (2) The rules of the commission must have the force of law in each member state, provided

9 be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
10 (3) The commission may exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this
11 article and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules must become binding as of the date specified by the

14 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within 4 years of the date of

16 applying to participate in the compact.
17 (5) Rules may be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
18 (6) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow
19 persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.

11 (10) Nothing in this article may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
12 may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this article.
13 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed
14 rule based on the rulemaking record.
15 (a) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge
16 the original purpose of the proposed rule.
17 (b) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to
18 the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
19 commenters.
20 (c) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
21 emergency as provided in subsection 12 of this article, the effective date of the rule may not be sooner than 30
22 days after the commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
23 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
24 emergency rule with 24 hours' notice, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact
25 and in this article must be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than

8 revision may be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
9 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made
10 in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
11 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect

18 (a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce
19 this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
20 (b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission must be brought solely

23 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
24 in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
25 (c) The commission must be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the

2 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:
3 (a) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
4 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written
5 notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default must describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
6 default, and any other action that the commission may take, and must offer training and specific technical
7 assistance regarding the default.
8 (b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
9 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
10 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges,
11 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
12 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
13 default.
14 (4) Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of
15 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the

25 (7) The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
