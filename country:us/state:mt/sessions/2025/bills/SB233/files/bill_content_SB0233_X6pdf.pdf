(4) Nothing in this compact, nor any rule of the commission, may be construed to limit, restrict, or
in any way reduce the ability of a licensee's home state to take adverse action against a licensee's multistate
license based upon information provided by a remote state.
(5) Insofar as practical, a member state's licensing authority shall cooperate with the commission
and with each entity exercising independent regulatory authority over the practice of massage therapy
according to the provisions of this compact.
ARTICLE 6
ADVERSE ACTIONS
(1) A licensee's home state must have exclusive power to impose an adverse action against a
licensee's multistate license issued by the home state.
(2) A home state may take adverse action on a multistate license based on the investigative
information, current significant investigative information, or adverse action of a remote state.
(3) A home state shall retain authority to complete any pending investigations of a licensee
practicing under a multistate license who changes their home state during the course of such an investigation.
The licensing authority must also be empowered to report the results of such an investigation to the
commission through the data system as described herein.
(4) Any member state may investigate actual or alleged violations of the scope of practice laws in
any other member state for a massage therapist who holds a multistate license.
(5) A remote state must have the authority to:
(a) take adverse actions against a licensee's authorization to practice;
(b) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a licensee's authorization to
practice in that state;
(c) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and
testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing authority in a
member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another
member state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings before it. The issuing
licensing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service

(d) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected licensee the costs of
investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee; and
(e) take adverse action against the licensee's authorization to practice in that state based on the
factual findings of another member state.
(6) If an adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's multistate license or single-
state license to practice in the home state, the licensee's authorization to practice in all other member states
must be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from such license. All home state disciplinary
orders that impose an adverse action against a licensee must include a statement that the massage therapist's
authorization to practice is deactivated in all member states during the pendency of the order.
(7) If adverse action is taken by a remote state against a licensee's authorization to practice, that
adverse action applies to all authorizations to practice in all remote states. A licensee whose authorization to
practice in a remote state is removed for a specified period of time is not eligible to apply for a new multistate
license in any other state until the specific time for removal of the authorization to practice has passed and all
encumbrance requirements are satisfied.
(8) Nothing in this compact may override a member state's authority to accept a licensee's
participation in an alternative program in lieu of adverse action. A licensee's multistate license must be
suspended for the duration of the licensee's participation in any alternative program.

(a) In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respective scope of practice laws
or other applicable state law, a member state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of
licensees.

of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the compact.

RULEMAKING
(1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule may be invalid and have no force
or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission exercised
its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers
granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
(2) The rules of the commission must have the force of law in each member state, provided
however that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the member state that establish the
member state's scope of practice as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission must
be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
(3) The commission may exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this
article and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules must become binding as of the date specified by the
commission for each rule.
(4) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by
enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within 4 years of the date of
adoption of the rule, then such rule may not have further force and effect in any member state or to any state
applying to participate in the compact.
(5) Rules may be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
(6) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow
persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.

69th Legislature 2025 SB 233
(7) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, and at least 30 days in advance of the
meeting at which the commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission shall provide
a notice of proposed rulemaking:
(a) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;
(b) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices of proposed rulemaking;
and
(c) in such other way(s) as the commission may by rule specify.
(8) The notice of proposed rulemaking must include:
(a) the time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the commission will hear public
comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the
commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
(b) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other electronic means, the
commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
(c) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
(d) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
(e) the manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
(9) All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents
received by the commission in response to the proposed rule must be available to the public.
(10) Nothing in this article may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this article.
(11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed
rule based on the rulemaking record.
(a) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge
the original purpose of the proposed rule.
(b) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to
the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by

(c) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – SB 233
ENROLLED BILL

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 233
emergency as provided in subsection 12 of this article, the effective date of the rule may not be sooner than 30
days after the commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
(12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
emergency rule with 24 hours' notice, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact
and in this article must be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than
90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that
must be adopted immediately to:
(a) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
(b) prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;
(c) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or

previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency,
or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions must be posted on the website of the commission. The
revision may be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made
in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
without the approval of the commission.
(14) No member state's rulemaking requirements may apply under this compact.

this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
(b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission must be brought solely
and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SB 233
ENROLLED BILL

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 233
commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
(c) The commission must be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
enforcement or interpretation of the compact and must have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process must render a judgment or order void as to the
commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
(2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:
(a) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written
notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default must describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
default, and any other action that the commission may take, and must offer training and specific technical
assistance regarding the default.
(b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
(3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges,
and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
default.
(4) Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of
securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting
state's state licensing authority, and each of the member states' state licensing authority.
(5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
termination.
(6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately
provide notice to all licensees who hold a multistate license within that state of such termination. The terminated
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SB 233
ENROLLED BILL

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 233
state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after
the date of said notice of termination.
(7) The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
has been terminated from the compact unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
defaulting state.
(8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. district
court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
(9) Dispute resolution:
(a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to
the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.
(b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
resolution for disputes as appropriate.
(10) Enforcement:
(a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this
compact and the commission's rules.
(b) By majority vote as provided by commission rule, the commission may initiate legal action
against a member state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal
district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact
and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The
commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
(c) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court for the
District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of
such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.

ARTICLE 12
EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL,
AND AMENDMENT
(1) The compact must come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into
law in the seventh member state.
(a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the
enactment of each of the charter member states to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter
member state is materially different than the model compact statute.
(i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
compact statute must be entitled to the default process set forth in article 11.
(ii) If any member state is later found to be in default or is terminated or withdraws from the
compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact must remain in effect even if the number
of member states should be less than seven.
(b) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter member states must be subject
to the process set forth in article 8(3)(w) to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model
compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
(c) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the
administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
existence must be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the
commission.

exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted
by the commission must have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.
(2) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing that state's
enactment of the compact.

- 23 - Authorized Print Version – SB 233
ENROLLED BILL

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 233
repealing statute.

effective date of withdrawal.

provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to
this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
(3) Nothing contained in this compact may be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure
agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
conflict with the provisions of this compact.
(4) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact may
become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
ARTICLE 13
CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
(1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed so as to
effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's
rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
(2) The provisions of this compact must be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
agency, person, or circumstance may not be affected thereby.
(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this article, the commission may deny a state's participation
in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of article 11, subsection (2), terminate a member state's
participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material

departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact must be held to be contrary to the constitution of any
member state, the compact must remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full
force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
ARTICLE 14
CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT
WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
Nothing herein may prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not
inconsistent with the compact. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in
conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. All permissible agreements between the
commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
