10 licensee's multistate license issued by the home state.

12 information, current significant investigative information, or adverse action of a remote state.
13 (3) A home state shall retain authority to complete any pending investigations of a licensee
14 practicing under a multistate license who changes their home state during the course of such an investigation.
15 The licensing authority must also be empowered to report the results of such an investigation to the
16 commission through the data system as described herein.

18 any other member state for a massage therapist who holds a multistate license.

10 authorization to practice is deactivated in all member states during the pendency of the order.
11 (7) If adverse action is taken by a remote state against a licensee's authorization to practice, that
12 adverse action applies to all authorizations to practice in all remote states. A licensee whose authorization to
13 practice in a remote state is removed for a specified period of time is not eligible to apply for a new multistate

2 minutes.
3 (f) The commission shall keep minutes that fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in a
4 meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken, and the reasons therefore, including a
5 description of the views expressed. All documents considered in connection with an action must be identified in
6 such minutes. All minutes and documents of a closed meeting must remain under seal, subject to release only
7 by a majority vote of the commission or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

9 (a) The commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable expenses of its

3 error, or omission that occurred, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for
4 believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided that nothing
5 in this paragraph may be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury,

8 hereunder.

10 representative of the commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or
11 alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or

13 reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities,
14 provided that nothing herein may be construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their

16 person's intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
17 (c) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer, executive director,
18 employee, and representative of the commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against
19 that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of
20 commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing
21 occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or
22 alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
23 (d) Nothing herein may be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for professional
24 malpractice or misconduct, which must be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
25 (e) Nothing in this compact may be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a member state's
26 state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman Act,

9 RULEMAKING
10 (1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
11 implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule may be invalid and have no force
12 or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission exercised
13 its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers
14 granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
15 (2) The rules of the commission must have the force of law in each member state, provided
16 however that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the member state that establish the
17 member state's scope of practice as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission must
18 be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
19 (3) The commission may exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this
20 article and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules must become binding as of the date specified by the
21 commission for each rule.
22 (4) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by
23 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within 4 years of the date of
24 adoption of the rule, then such rule may not have further force and effect in any member state or to any state
25 applying to participate in the compact.
26 (5) Rules may be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
27 (6) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow
28 persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – SB 233
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 233.1
1 (7) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, and at least 30 days in advance of the
2 meeting at which the commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission shall provide
3 a notice of proposed rulemaking:
4 (a) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;
5 (b) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices of proposed rulemaking;
6 and
7 (c) in such other way(s) as the commission may by rule specify.
8 (8) The notice of proposed rulemaking must include:
9 (a) the time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the commission will hear public
10 comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the
11 commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
12 (b) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other electronic means, the
13 commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
14 (c) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
15 (d) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
16 (e) the manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
17 (9) All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents
18 received by the commission in response to the proposed rule must be available to the public.
19 (10) Nothing in this article may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
20 may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this article.
21 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed
22 rule based on the rulemaking record.
23 (a) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge
24 the original purpose of the proposed rule.
25 (b) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to
26 the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
27 commenters.
28 (c) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
- 19 - Authorized Print Version – SB 233
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 233.1
1 emergency as provided in subsection 12 of this article, the effective date of the rule may not be sooner than 30
2 days after the commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
3 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
4 emergency rule with 24 hours' notice, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact
5 and in this article must be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than
6 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that
7 must be adopted immediately to:
8 (a) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
9 (b) prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;
10 (c) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or

15 revision may be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
16 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made
17 in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
18 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
19 without the approval of the commission.
20 (14) No member state's rulemaking requirements may apply under this compact.

25 (a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce
26 this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
27 (b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission must be brought solely
28 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – SB 233
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 233.1
1 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
2 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
3 in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
4 (c) The commission must be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
5 enforcement or interpretation of the compact and must have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
6 purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process must render a judgment or order void as to the
7 commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
8 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:
9 (a) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
10 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written
11 notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default must describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
12 default, and any other action that the commission may take, and must offer training and specific technical
13 assistance regarding the default.
14 (b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
15 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
16 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges,
17 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
18 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
19 default.
20 (4) Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of
21 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
22 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting
23 state's state licensing authority, and each of the member states' state licensing authority.
24 (5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
25 incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
26 termination.
27 (6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately
28 provide notice to all licensees who hold a multistate license within that state of such termination. The terminated
- 21 - Authorized Print Version – SB 233

69th Legislature 2025 SB 233.1
1 state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after
2 the date of said notice of termination.
3 (7) The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
4 has been terminated from the compact unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
5 defaulting state.
6 (8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. district
7 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
8 prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
9 (9) Dispute resolution:
10 (a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to
11 the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.
12 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
13 resolution for disputes as appropriate.
14 (10) Enforcement:
15 (a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this
16 compact and the commission's rules.
17 (b) By majority vote as provided by commission rule, the commission may initiate legal action
18 against a member state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal
19 district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact
20 and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
21 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
22 reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The
23 commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
24 (c) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court for the
25 District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
26 with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
27 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of
28 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.

3 ARTICLE 12
4 EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL,
5 AND AMENDMENT
6 (1) The compact must come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into
7 law in the seventh member state.
8 (a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the
9 enactment of each of the charter member states to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter
10 member state is materially different than the model compact statute.
11 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
12 compact statute must be entitled to the default process set forth in article 11.
13 (ii) If any member state is later found to be in default or is terminated or withdraws from the
14 compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact must remain in effect even if the number
15 of member states should be less than seven.
16 (b) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter member states must be subject
17 to the process set forth in article 8(3)(w) to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model
18 compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in the compact.
19 (c) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the
20 administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
21 existence must be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the
22 commission.
23 (d) Any state that joins the compact must be subject to the commission's rules and bylaws as they

26 (2) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing that state's
27 enactment of the compact.

6 provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
7 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to

10 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
11 conflict with the provisions of this compact.
12 (4) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact may
13 become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
14 ARTICLE 13
15 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
16 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed so as to
17 effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
18 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's
19 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
20 (2) The provisions of this compact must be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
21 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
22 member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
23 to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
24 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
25 agency, person, or circumstance may not be affected thereby.
26 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this article, the commission may deny a state's participation
27 in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of article 11, subsection (2), terminate a member state's
28 participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material

3 force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
4 ARTICLE 14
5 CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT

10 authorization to practice is deactivated in all member states during the pendency of the order.
11 (7) If adverse action is taken by a remote state against a licensee's authorization to practice, that
12 adverse action applies to all authorizations to practice in all remote states. A licensee whose authorization to
13 practice in a remote state is removed for a specified period of time is not eligible to apply for a new multistate

3 error, or omission that occurred, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for

13 reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities,
14 provided that nothing herein may be construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their

16 person's intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
17 (c) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer, executive director,
18 employee, and representative of the commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against

9 RULEMAKING
10 (1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
11 implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule may be invalid and have no force
12 or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission exercised
13 its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers
14 granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
15 (2) The rules of the commission must have the force of law in each member state, provided
16 however that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the member state that establish the
17 member state's scope of practice as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission must
18 be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
19 (3) The commission may exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this
20 article and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules must become binding as of the date specified by the
21 commission for each rule.
22 (4) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by
23 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within 4 years of the date of
24 adoption of the rule, then such rule may not have further force and effect in any member state or to any state
25 applying to participate in the compact.
26 (5) Rules may be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
27 (6) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow
28 persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.

2 meeting at which the commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission shall provide
3 a notice of proposed rulemaking:
4 (a) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;
5 (b) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices of proposed rulemaking;
6 and
7 (c) in such other way(s) as the commission may by rule specify.
8 (8) The notice of proposed rulemaking must include:
9 (a) the time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the commission will hear public

11 commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
12 (b) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other electronic means, the
13 commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
14 (c) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
15 (d) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
16 (e) the manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
17 (9) All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents
18 received by the commission in response to the proposed rule must be available to the public.
19 (10) Nothing in this article may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
20 may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this article.
21 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed
22 rule based on the rulemaking record.
23 (a) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge
24 the original purpose of the proposed rule.
25 (b) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to
26 the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
27 commenters.

69th Legislature 2025 SB 233.1
1 emergency as provided in subsection 12 of this article, the effective date of the rule may not be sooner than 30
2 days after the commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
3 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
4 emergency rule with 24 hours' notice, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact
5 and in this article must be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than
6 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that

8 (a) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
9 (b) prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;
10 (c) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or

15 revision may be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
16 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made
17 in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
18 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
19 without the approval of the commission.
20 (14) No member state's rulemaking requirements may apply under this compact.

1 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
2 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
3 in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
4 (c) The commission must be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
5 enforcement or interpretation of the compact and must have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
6 purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process must render a judgment or order void as to the
7 commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
8 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:
9 (a) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
10 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written
11 notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default must describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
12 default, and any other action that the commission may take, and must offer training and specific technical
13 assistance regarding the default.
14 (b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
15 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
16 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges,
17 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
18 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
19 default.
20 (4) Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of
21 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
22 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting
23 state's state licensing authority, and each of the member states' state licensing authority.
24 (5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
25 incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
26 termination.
27 (6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately
28 provide notice to all licensees who hold a multistate license within that state of such termination. The terminated

1 state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after
2 the date of said notice of termination.
3 (7) The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
4 has been terminated from the compact unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
5 defaulting state.
6 (8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. district
7 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
8 prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
9 (9) Dispute resolution:
10 (a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to
11 the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.
12 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
13 resolution for disputes as appropriate.
14 (10) Enforcement:

18 against a member state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal
19 district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact
20 and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
21 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
22 reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The
23 commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
24 (c) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court for the
25 District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
26 with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
27 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of
28 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.

7 law in the seventh member state.
8 (a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the
9 enactment of each of the charter member states to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter
10 member state is materially different than the model compact statute.
11 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
12 compact statute must be entitled to the default process set forth in article 11.
13 (ii) If any member state is later found to be in default or is terminated or withdraws from the
14 compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact must remain in effect even if the number
15 of member states should be less than seven.
16 (b) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter member states must be subject
17 to the process set forth in article 8(3)(w) to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model

13 become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
14 ARTICLE 13
15 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
16 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed so as to
17 effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
18 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's

21 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
22 member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
23 to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
24 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
25 agency, person, or circumstance may not be affected thereby.
26 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this article, the commission may deny a state's participation
27 in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of article 11, subsection (2), terminate a member state's
