14 operations and activities of the commission and its staff, which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover its
15 annual budget as approved each year for which revenue is not provided by other sources. The aggregate
16 annual assessment amount for member states must be allocated based upon a formula that the commission
17 shall promulgate by rule.
18 (d) The commission may not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to
19 meet the same, nor may the commission pledge the credit of any member states, except by and with the

22 and disbursements of the commission must be subject to the financial review and accounting procedures

2 error, or omission that occurred, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for
3 believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities; provided that nothing
4 in this paragraph may be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury,
5 or liability caused by the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person. The procurement of
6 insurance of any type by the commission may not in any way compromise or limit the immunity granted
7 hereunder.
8 (b) The commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee, and
9 representative of the commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or
10 alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or
11 responsibilities, or as determined by the commission that the person against whom the claim is made had a
12 reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities,
13 provided that nothing herein may be construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their
14 own expense, and provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that
15 person's intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
16 (c) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer, executive director,
17 employee, and representative of the commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against
18 that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of
19 commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing
20 occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or
21 alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
22 (d) Nothing herein may be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for professional
23 malpractice or misconduct, which must be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.
24 (e) Nothing in this compact may be interpreted to waive or otherwise abrogate a member state's
25 state action immunity or state action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman Act,
26 Clayton Act, or any other state or federal antitrust or anticompetitive law or regulation.
27 (f) Nothing in this compact may be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity by the member
28 states or by the commission.

8 RULEMAKING
9 (1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
10 implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule may be invalid and have no force
11 or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission exercised
12 its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the powers
13 granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
14 (2) The rules of the commission must have the force of law in each member state, provided
15 however that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the member state that establish the
16 member state's scope of practice as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission must
17 be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
18 (3) The commission may exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this
19 article and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules must become binding as of the date specified by the
20 commission for each rule.
21 (4) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by
22 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within 4 years of the date of
23 adoption of the rule, then such rule may not have further force and effect in any member state or to any state
24 applying to participate in the compact.
25 (5) Rules may be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
26 (6) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow
27 persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
28 (7) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, and at least 30 days in advance of the
- 18 - LC 868

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 0868
1 meeting at which the commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission shall provide
2 a notice of proposed rulemaking:
3 (a) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;
4 (b) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices of proposed rulemaking;
5 and
6 (c) in such other way(s) as the commission may by rule specify.
7 (8) The notice of proposed rulemaking must include:
8 (a) the time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the commission will hear public
9 comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the
10 commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;
11 (b) if the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other electronic means, the
12 commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;
13 (c) the text of the proposed rule and the reason therefor;
14 (d) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
15 (e) the manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
16 (9) All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents
17 received by the commission in response to the proposed rule must be available to the public.
18 (10) Nothing in this article may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
19 may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this article.
20 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed
21 rule based on the rulemaking record.
22 (a) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge
23 the original purpose of the proposed rule.
24 (b) The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to
25 the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
26 commenters.
27 (c) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
28 emergency as provided in subsection 12 of this article, the effective date of the rule may not be sooner than 30
- 19 - LC 868

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 0868
1 days after the commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
2 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
3 emergency rule with 24 hours' notice, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact
4 and in this article must be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than
5 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that
6 must be adopted immediately to:
7 (a) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
8 (b) prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;
9 (c) meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or
10 (d) protect public health and safety.
11 (13) The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a
12 previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency,
13 or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions must be posted on the website of the commission. The
14 revision may be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
15 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made
16 in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
17 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
18 without the approval of the commission.
19 (14) No member state's rulemaking requirements may apply under this compact.
20 ARTICLE 11
21 OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION,
22 AND ENFORCEMENT
23 (1) Oversight:
24 (a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce
25 this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
26 (b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission must be brought solely
27 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
28 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
- 20 - LC 868

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 0868
1 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
2 in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter.
3 (c) The commission must be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
4 enforcement or interpretation of the compact and must have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
5 purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process must render a judgment or order void as to the
6 commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
7 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:
8 (a) If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
9 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written
10 notice to the defaulting state. The notice of default must describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
11 default, and any other action that the commission may take, and must offer training and specific technical
12 assistance regarding the default.
13 (b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
14 (3) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
15 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges,
16 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
17 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
18 default.
19 (4) Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of
20 securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the
21 commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, the defaulting
22 state's state licensing authority, and each of the member states' state licensing authority.
23 (5) A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
24 incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of
25 termination.
26 (6) Upon the termination of a state's membership from this compact, that state shall immediately
27 provide notice to all licensees who hold a multistate license within that state of such termination. The terminated
28 state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after
- 21 - LC 868

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 0868
1 the date of said notice of termination.
2 (7) The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that
3 has been terminated from the compact unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the
4 defaulting state.
5 (8) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. district
6 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The
7 prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
8 (9) Dispute resolution:
9 (a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to
10 the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.
11 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
12 resolution for disputes as appropriate.
13 (10) Enforcement:
14 (a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this
15 compact and the commission's rules.
16 (b) By majority vote as provided by commission rule, the commission may initiate legal action
17 against a member state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal
18 district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact
19 and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
20 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
21 reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The
22 commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting member state's law.
23 (c) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. district court for the
24 District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance
25 with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
26 and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of
27 such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.
28 (d) No individual or entity other than a member state may enforce this compact against the

69th Legislature 2025 LC 0868
1 commission.
2 ARTICLE 12

6 law in the seventh member state.
7 (a) On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the
8 enactment of each of the charter member states to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter
9 member state is materially different than the model compact statute.
10 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
11 compact statute must be entitled to the default process set forth in article 11.
12 (ii) If any member state is later found to be in default or is terminated or withdraws from the
13 compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact must remain in effect even if the number
14 of member states should be less than seven.
15 (b) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter member states must be subject
16 to the process set forth in article 8(3)(w) to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model

25 (2) Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing that state's

5 provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
6 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to

9 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
10 conflict with the provisions of this compact.
11 (4) This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact may
12 become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
13 ARTICLE 13
14 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
15 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed so as to
16 effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact. Provisions of the compact
17 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's
18 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
19 (2) The provisions of this compact must be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or
20 provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
21 member state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof
22 to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
23 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government,
24 agency, person, or circumstance may not be affected thereby.
25 (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this article, the commission may deny a state's participation
26 in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of article 11, subsection (2), terminate a member state's
27 participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material
28 departure from the compact. Otherwise, if this compact must be held to be contrary to the constitution of any
- 24 - LC 868

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 0868
1 member state, the compact must remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full
2 force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.
3 ARTICLE 14
4 CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT
5 WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
6 Nothing herein may prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not
7 inconsistent with the compact. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a member state in
8 conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. All permissible agreements between the
9 commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.
