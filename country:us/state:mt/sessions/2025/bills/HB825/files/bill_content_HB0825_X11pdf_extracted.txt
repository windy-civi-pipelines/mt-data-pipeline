human experimentation affecting care and treatment or requiring direct patient involvement and to have the
studies fully explained prior to consent. A patient who declines to participate in research or experimentation is
entitled to the most effective care that the hospital can otherwise provide.
(o) The patient has the right to expect continuity of care and care coordination between the
patient's regular care provider and hospital care and to be informed by physicians and other caregivers of
available and realistic patient care options when hospital care is no longer appropriate.
