3 person and set a date and time for hold the hearing on the petition without undue delay that may not be on the
4 same day as the initial appearance and that may not exceed 5 days, including weekends and holidays, unless

6 upon which an order is made, and if involuntary administration of medication or other stabilization treatment is
7 ordered, the court shall also enter into the record the specific findings that the state has proved an overriding
8 justification for the order and that the treatment being ordered is medically appropriate. The court may authorize
9 the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician, or the chief medical officer of the department of public health
10 and human services or a physician or advanced practice registered nurse who is under the supervision of or
11 employed by the department of public health and human services, to be designated by the court to administer

17 fitness to proceed. The treatment plan may include a physician's prescription of reasonable and appropriate
18 medication that is consistent with accepted medical standards.
19 (ii) If the defendant refuses to comply with the treatment plan, the facility may involuntarily
20 administer medications to treat a defendant pursuant to the determination of the facility’s treatment review
21 committee and involuntary medication review board, if the following criteria are met:
22 (A) the defendant suffers from a mental illness or mental disorder;
23 (B) the defendant has been determined to lack fitness to proceed;
24 (C) the involuntary administration of medication is in the best medical interests of the defendant;
25 (D) the defendant is either gravely disabled or poses a likelihood of serious harm to self or others;

4 review and involuntary administration of medication by a mental health facility, as defined in 53-21-102, a

6 (e) After the initial review of the defendant’s custodial status under subsection (6)(a) (3)(a), the
7 court shall review the defendant’s custodial status every 30 days or at an interval the court determines
8 appropriate under the circumstances. If on subsequent review the defendant is still unfit, it does not appear that
9 the defendant will become fit within the reasonably foreseeable future, and that alternatives to forensic
10 commitment are not appropriate under the circumstances, the court shall order the proceeding against the
11 defendant dismissed without prejudice and the prosecutor shall may petition the court in the manner provided in
12 Title 53, chapter 21, to determine the disposition of the defendant pursuant to those provisions.
13 (c)(f) If the court determines that the defendant lacks fitness to proceed because the defendant has
14 a developmental disability as defined in 53-20-102, the proceeding against the defendant must be dismissed
15 and the prosecutor shall petition the court in the manner provided in Title 53, chapter 20, to determine the
16 disposition of the defendant pursuant to those provisions.
17 (4)(7)(4) The fact that the defendant is unfit to proceed does not preclude any legal objection to
18 the prosecution that is susceptible to fair determination prior to trial and that is made without the personal
19 participation of the defendant.
20 (5)(8) Except as provided in subsection (6), the expenses of transporting the defendant to the
21 custody of the director of the department of public health and human services to be placed in an appropriate
22 facility of the department of public health and human services, of the care, custody, and treatment of the
