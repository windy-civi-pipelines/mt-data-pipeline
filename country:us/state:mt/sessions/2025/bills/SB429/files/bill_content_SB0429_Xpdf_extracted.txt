medication that is consistent with accepted medical standards.

medication hearing, and an appeal process.

review and involuntary administration of medication by a mental health facility, as defined in 53-21-102, a

shall review the defendant’s custodial status every 30 days or at an interval the court determines appropriate
under the circumstances. If on subsequent review the defendant is still unfit, it does not appear that the
defendant will become fit within the reasonably foreseeable future, and that alternatives to forensic commitment

dismissed without prejudice and the prosecutor may petition the court in the manner provided in Title 53,

disposition of the defendant pursuant to those provisions.

custody of the director of the department of public health and human services to be placed in an appropriate
