1 mental disorder or mental illness, the court shall assess whether the proceeding against the defendant must be
2 dismissed, except as provided in subsection (4) or whether alternatives to incarceration, if applicable, or to
3 commitment are appropriate under the circumstances, including whether the involuntary administration of
4 medication is necessary.
5 (b) If the court determines that the defendant lacks fitness to proceed because the defendant has
6 a mental disorder, the proceeding against the defendant must be dismissed and the prosecutor shall petition
7 the court in the manner provided in Title 53, chapter 21, to determine the disposition of the defendant pursuant
8 to those provisions.
9 (b) (i) If, on review of the defendant’s custodial status related to any commitment ordered pursuant
10 to subsection (2), it is determined that an incarcerated defendant requires stabilization treatment, including
11 administration of medication, the county attorney shall, within 7 days, petition the court for an order requiring
12 compliance with stabilization treatment, including involuntary administration of medication.
13 (ii) The defendant has a right to a hearing on the petition. The judge shall appoint a professional
14 person and set a date and time for the hearing on the petition that may not be on the same day as the initial
15 appearance and that may not exceed 5 days, including weekends and holidays, unless the fifth day falls on a
16 weekend or holiday. The court shall enter into the record a detailed statement of the facts upon which an order
17 is made, and if involuntary administration of medication or other stabilization treatment is ordered, the court
18 shall also enter into the record the specific findings that the state has proved an overriding justification for the
19 order and that the treatment being ordered is medically appropriate. The court may authorize the chief medical
20 officer of a facility or a physician, or the chief medical officer of the department of public health and human
21 services or a physician or advanced practice registered nurse who is under the supervision of or employed by
22 the department of public health and human services, to be designated by the court to administer appropriate
23 medication involuntarily.
24 (c) (i) On admission to an appropriate mental health facility, residential facility, or to the custody of
25 the director of the department of public health and human services under subsection (2), the facility shall
26 evaluate the defendant and develop an individualized treatment plan to assist the defendant to gain or regain
27 fitness to proceed. The treatment plan may include a physician's prescription of reasonable and appropriate
28 medication that is consistent with accepted medical standards.

1 (ii) If the defendant refuses to comply with the treatment plan, the facility may involuntarily
2 administer medications to treat a defendant pursuant to the determination of the facility’s treatment review
3 committee and involuntary medication review board, if the following criteria are met:
4 (A) the defendant suffers from a mental illness or mental disorder;
5 (B) the defendant has been determined to lack fitness to proceed;
6 (C) the involuntary administration of medication is in the best medical interests of the defendant;
7 (D) the defendant is either gravely disabled or poses a likelihood of serious harm to self or others;
8 (E) the facility has established a treatment review committee and an involuntary medication review
9 board for the involuntary administration of psychotropic medications; and
10 (F) the policies and procedures relating to the involuntary medication review board require
11 provision to the defendant of a notice of rights and notice of an involuntary medication hearing, an involuntary
12 medication hearing, and an appeal process.
13 (d) The department of public health and human services shall adopt rules governing treatment
14 review and involuntary administration of medication by a mental health facility, as defined in 53-21-102, a
15 residential facility, as defined in 53-20-102, or the Montana state hospital.
16 (e) After the initial review of the defendant’s custodial status under subsection (6)(a), the court
17 shall review the defendant’s custodial status every 30 days or at an interval the court determines appropriate
18 under the circumstances. If on subsequent review the defendant is still unfit, it does not appear that the
19 defendant will become fit within the reasonably foreseeable future, and that alternatives to forensic commitment
20 are not appropriate under the circumstances, the court shall order the proceeding against the defendant
21 dismissed without prejudice and the prosecutor shall petition the court in the manner provided in Title 53,
22 chapter 21, to determine the disposition of the defendant pursuant to those provisions.
23 (c)(f) If the court determines that the defendant lacks fitness to proceed because the defendant has
24 a developmental disability as defined in 53-20-102, the proceeding against the defendant must be dismissed
25 and the prosecutor shall petition the court in the manner provided in Title 53, chapter 20, to determine the
26 disposition of the defendant pursuant to those provisions.
27 (4)(7) The fact that the defendant is unfit to proceed does not preclude any legal objection to the
28 prosecution that is susceptible to fair determination prior to trial and that is made without the personal

4 facility of the department of public health and human services, of the care, custody, and treatment of the
5 defendant at the facility, and of transporting the defendant back are payable by the court or, in district court
6 proceedings, by the office of court administrator. The costs incurred for commitment, examination, or treatment
7 ordered under this section must be paid by the office of the court administrator, regardless of whether the
8 commitment is to, or the examination or treatment is done at, the Montana state hospital or another facility.
9 Costs under this subsection (8) include:
10 (a) expenses of transporting a defendant from the place of detention to the place where the
11 examination is performed and returning a defendant to detention;
12 (b) personnel costs of a law enforcement agency by whom a defendant is detained;
