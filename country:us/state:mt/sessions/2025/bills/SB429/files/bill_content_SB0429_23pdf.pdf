21 or whether alternatives to incarceration, if applicable, or to commitment are appropriate under the
22 circumstances, including whether the involuntary administration of medication is necessary.

3 (ii) The defendant has a right to a hearing on the petition. The judge shall appoint a professional
4 person and set a date and time for HOLD the hearing on the petition WITHOUT UNDUE DELAY that may not be on
5 the same day as the initial appearance and that may not exceed 5 days, including weekends and holidays,
6 unless the fifth day falls on a weekend or holiday. The court shall enter into the record a detailed statement of
7 the facts upon which an order is made, and if involuntary administration of medication or other stabilization
8 treatment is ordered, the court shall also enter into the record the specific findings that the state has proved an
9 overriding justification for the order and that the treatment being ordered is medically appropriate. The court
10 may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician, or the chief medical officer of the department

18 fitness to proceed. The treatment plan may include a physician's prescription of reasonable and appropriate
19 medication that is consistent with accepted medical standards.
20 (ii) If the defendant refuses to comply with the treatment plan, the facility may involuntarily
21 administer medications to treat a defendant pursuant to the determination of the facility’s treatment review
22 committee and involuntary medication review board, if the following criteria are met:
23 (A) the defendant suffers from a mental illness or mental disorder;
24 (B) the defendant has been determined to lack fitness to proceed;
25 (C) the involuntary administration of medication is in the best medical interests of the defendant;

2 provision to the defendant of a notice of rights and notice of an involuntary medication hearing, an involuntary
3 medication hearing, and an appeal process.

5 review and involuntary administration of medication by a mental health facility, as defined in 53-21-102, a
6 residential facility, as defined in 53-20-102, or the Montana state hospital.
7 (e) After the initial review of the defendant’s custodial status under subsection (6)(a) (3)(A), the
8 court shall review the defendant’s custodial status every 30 days or at an interval the court determines
9 appropriate under the circumstances. If on subsequent review the defendant is still unfit, it does not appear that
10 the defendant will become fit within the reasonably foreseeable future, and that alternatives to forensic
11 commitment are not appropriate under the circumstances, the court shall order the proceeding against the
12 defendant dismissed without prejudice and the prosecutor shall MAY petition the court in the manner provided in
13 Title 53, chapter 21, to determine the disposition of the defendant pursuant to those provisions.
14 (c)(f) If the court determines that the defendant lacks fitness to proceed because the defendant has
15 a developmental disability as defined in 53-20-102, the proceeding against the defendant must be dismissed
16 and the prosecutor shall petition the court in the manner provided in Title 53, chapter 20, to determine the
17 disposition of the defendant pursuant to those provisions.
18 (4)(7) (4) The fact that the defendant is unfit to proceed does not preclude any legal objection to
19 the prosecution that is susceptible to fair determination prior to trial and that is made without the personal
20 participation of the defendant.
21 (5)(8) Except as provided in subsection (6), the expenses of transporting the defendant to the
22 custody of the director of the department of public health and human services to be placed in an appropriate
23 facility of the department of public health and human services, of the care, custody, and treatment of the
