3 or to the custody of the director of the department of public health and human services under subsection (2)
4 and is still unfit to proceed and that it does not appear that the defendant will become fit to proceed within the
5 reasonably foreseeable future, because the defendant has a mental disorder or mental illness, the court shall

7 or whether alternatives to incarceration, if applicable, or to commitment are appropriate under the
8 circumstances, including whether the involuntary administration of medication is necessary.
9 (b) If the court determines that the defendant lacks fitness to proceed because the defendant has

16 requiring compliance with stabilization treatment, including involuntary administration of medication.
17 (ii) The defendant has a right to a hearing on the petition. The judge shall appoint a professional

19 the same day as the initial appearance and that may not exceed 5 days, including weekends and holidays,
20 unless the fifth day falls on a weekend or holiday. The court shall enter into the record a detailed statement of
21 the facts upon which an order is made, and if involuntary administration of medication or other stabilization
22 treatment is ordered, the court shall also enter into the record the specific findings that the state has proved an
23 overriding justification for the order and that the treatment being ordered is medically appropriate. The court
24 may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician, or the chief medical officer of the department
25 of public health and human services or a physician or advanced practice registered nurse who is under the
26 supervision of or employed by the department of public health and human services, to be designated by the
27 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily. THE DEPARTMENT MAY CONTRACT WITH QUALIFIED
28 PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE TREATMENT WITHIN AN INCARCERATIVE OR CUSTODIAL SETTING.

5 medication that is consistent with accepted medical standards.
6 (ii) If the defendant refuses to comply with the treatment plan, the facility may involuntarily
7 administer medications to treat a defendant pursuant to the determination of the facility’s treatment review
8 committee and involuntary medication review board, if the following criteria are met:
9 (A) the defendant suffers from a mental illness or mental disorder;
10 (B) the defendant has been determined to lack fitness to proceed;
11 (C) the involuntary administration of medication is in the best medical interests of the defendant;

24 the defendant will become fit within the reasonably foreseeable future, and that alternatives to forensic
25 commitment are not appropriate under the circumstances, the court shall order the proceeding against the
26 defendant dismissed without prejudice and the prosecutor shall MAY petition the court in the manner provided in
27 Title 53, chapter 21, to determine the disposition of the defendant pursuant to those provisions.

2 and the prosecutor shall petition the court in the manner provided in Title 53, chapter 20, to determine the
3 disposition of the defendant pursuant to those provisions.
4 (4)(7) (4) The fact that the defendant is unfit to proceed does not preclude any legal objection to
5 the prosecution that is susceptible to fair determination prior to trial and that is made without the personal
6 participation of the defendant.
7 (5)(8) Except as provided in subsection (6), the expenses of transporting the defendant to the
8 custody of the director of the department of public health and human services to be placed in an appropriate
