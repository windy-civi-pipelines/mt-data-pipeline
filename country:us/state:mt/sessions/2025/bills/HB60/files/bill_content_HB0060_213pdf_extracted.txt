10 correcting amendment.
11 (13) The commissioner may by order deny, suspend, or revoke registration of any broker-dealer,
12 salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative if the commissioner finds that the order
13 is in the public interest and that the applicant or registrant or, in the case of a broker-dealer or investment
14 adviser, any partner, officer, director, person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or
15 person directly or indirectly controlling the broker-dealer or investment adviser:
16 (a) has filed an application for registration under this section that, as of its effective date or as of

- 13 - Authorized Print Version – HB 60
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0060.2
1 commodities agency or administrator of another state or a court of competent jurisdiction, that the person has
2 violated the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Advisors Act of 1940,
3 the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Commodity Exchange Act or the securities or commodities law of
4 any other state;
5 (g) has engaged in dishonest or unethical practices in the securities business;
6 (h) is insolvent, either in the sense that the person's liabilities exceed the person's assets or in the
7 sense that the person cannot meet obligations as they mature, but the commissioner may not enter an order
8 against a broker-dealer or investment adviser under this subsection (13) without a finding of insolvency as to
9 the broker-dealer or investment adviser;
10 (i) has not complied with a condition imposed by the commissioner under this section or is not
11 qualified on the basis of such factors as training, experience, or knowledge of the securities business;
12 (j) has failed to pay the proper filing fee, but the commissioner may enter only a denial order
13 under this subsection (13), and the commissioner shall vacate any order when the deficiency has been
14 corrected; or
15 (k) has failed to reasonably supervise the person's salespersons or employees or investment
16 adviser representatives or employees to ensure their compliance with this act.
17 (14) The commissioner may not institute a suspension or revocation proceeding on the basis of a

20 (15) The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend registration pending final
21 determination of any proceeding under this section.
22 (16) Upon the entry of the order under subsection (13), the commissioner shall promptly notify the
23 applicant or registrant, as well as the employer or prospective employer if the applicant or registrant is a
24 salesperson or investment adviser representative, that it has been entered and of the reasons for the order and
25 that if requested by the applicant or registrant within 15 days after the receipt of the commissioner's notification,
26 the matter will be promptly set for hearing. If a hearing is not requested within 15 days and none is ordered by
27 the commissioner, the order will remain in effect until it is modified or vacated by the commissioner. If a hearing
28 is requested or ordered, the commissioner, after notice of and opportunity for hearing, may modify or vacate the
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 60
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0060.2
1 order or extend it until final determination.
2 (17) If the commissioner finds that a registrant or applicant for registration is no longer in existence
3 or has ceased to do business as a broker-dealer, salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser

5 conservator, or guardian or cannot be located after reasonable search, the commissioner may by order cancel
6 the registration or application.
7 (18) The commissioner may, after suspending or revoking registration of any broker-dealer,
8 salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative, impose a fine not to exceed $5,000
9 upon the broker-dealer, salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative. The fine is in
10 addition to all other penalties imposed by the laws of this state and must be collected by the commissioner in
11 the name of the state of Montana and deposited in the general fund. Imposition of any fine under this
12 subsection is an order from which an appeal may be taken pursuant to 30-10-308. If any broker-dealer,
13 salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative fails to pay a fine referred to in this
14 subsection, the amount of the fine is a lien upon all of the assets and property of the broker-dealer,
15 salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative in this state and may be recovered by
16 suit by the commissioner and deposited in the general fund. Failure of a broker-dealer, salesperson, investment
17 adviser, or investment adviser representative to pay a fine also constitutes a forfeiture of the right to do
18 business in this state under parts 1 through 3 of this chapter.
19 (19) A sole proprietor registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser who does not employ
20 other salespersons or investment adviser representatives, other than the sole proprietor, is not required to
21 register as both a broker-dealer and a salesperson or as an investment adviser and an investment adviser
22 representative if the sole proprietor meets the examination requirements established by the commissioner by
23 rule.
24 (20) A person who is subject to the provisions of this section and who has passed the general
25 securities principal's examination is not required to also pass the uniform investment adviser law examination.
26 The commissioner shall by rule provide for a form that a person who passes the general securities principal's
27 examination shall file with the commissioner as a verification of having passed the examination unless the
28 commissioner can verify electronically that the person has passed the exam."

5 buying the security from the offeror or seller, who may sue either at law or in equity to recover the consideration
6 paid for the security, together with interest at 10% a year from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable
7 attorneys' fees, less the amount of any income received on the security, upon the tender of the security, or for
8 damages if the buyer no longer owns the security. Damages are the amount that would be recoverable upon a
9 tender less:
10 (a) the value of the security when the buyer disposed of it; and
11 (b) interest at 10% a year from the date of disposition.
12 (2) Every person who directly or indirectly controls a seller liable under subsection (1), every
13 partner, officer, or director (or person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions) or employee of
14 the seller, and every broker-dealer or salesperson who participates or materially aids in the sale is liable jointly
15 and severally with and to the same extent as the seller if the nonseller knew, or in the exercise of reasonable
16 care could have known, of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist. There
17 must be contribution among the several liable persons.
18 (3) Any tender specified in this section may be made at any time before entry of judgment. A cause
19 of action under this statute survives the death of any person who might have been a plaintiff or a defendant. A
20 person may not sue under this section if:
21 (a) the buyer has received a written offer, at a time when the buyer owned the security, to refund
22 the consideration paid, together with interest at 10% a year from the date of payment, less the amount of any
23 income received on the security and the buyer failed to accept the offer within 30 days of its receipt; or
24 (b) the buyer has received a written offer at a time when the buyer did not own the security in the
25 amount that would be recoverable under subsection (1) upon a tender less:
26 (i) the value of the security when the buyer disposed of it; and

1 provision of parts 1 through 3 of this chapter or any rule or order under parts 1 through 3 of this chapter or who
2 has acquired any purported right under the contract with knowledge of the facts by reason of which its making
3 or performance was in violation may not base any suit on the contract. Any condition, stipulation, or provision
4 binding any person acquiring any security to waive compliance with any provision of parts 1 through 3 of this
5 chapter or any rule or order adopted under parts 1 through 3 of this chapter is void as against public policy and
6 in the public interest.
7 (5) (a) An action may not be maintained under this section to enforce any liability founded on a

9 violation or after the discovery should have been made by exercise of reasonable diligence.
10 (b) An action may not be maintained under this section to enforce any liability founded on fraud or
11 misrepresentation unless it is brought within 2 years after discovery of the fraud or misrepresentation on which

5 termination of the health plan, constitutes an adverse determination; and
6 (b) the health insurance issuer shall notify the covered person or, if applicable, the covered
7 person's authorized representative of the adverse determination in accordance with subsection (8) at a time
8 sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow the covered person or, if applicable, the covered
9 person's authorized representative to:
10 (i) file a grievance requesting a review of the adverse determination pursuant to Title 33, chapter
11 32, parts 3 and 4; and
12 (ii) obtain a determination with respect to the review of the adverse determination before the
13 benefit is reduced or terminated.
14 (5) The health care service or treatment that is the subject of the adverse determination must be
15 continued without liability to the covered person pending a determination under the internal review request
16 made pursuant to Title 33, chapter 32, part 3.
17 (6) (a) For retrospective review determinations, a health insurance issuer shall make the
18 determination no later than 30 days after the date of receiving the benefit request.
19 (b) If the determination is an adverse determination, the health insurance issuer shall provide
20 notice of the adverse determination to the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized
21 representative in accordance with subsection (8).
22 (c) The time period for making a determination and notifying the covered person or, if applicable,
23 the covered person's authorized representative of the determination pursuant to subsection (6)(a) may be
24 extended one time by the health insurance issuer for up to 15 days if the health insurance issuer:
25 (i) determines that an extension is necessary due to matters beyond the health insurance issuer's
26 control; and
27 (ii) notifies the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative,
28 prior to the expiration of the initial 30-day period, of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and of the
- 50 - Authorized Print Version – HB 60
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0060.2
1 date by which the health insurance issuer expects to make a determination.
2 (d) If the extension under subsection (6)(c) is necessary because of the failure of the covered
3 person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative to submit information necessary to
4 reach a determination on the request, the notice of extension must:
5 (i) describe specifically the information required to complete the request; and
6 (ii) give the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative at
7 least 45 days after the date of receipt of the notice to provide the specified information.
8 (e) A health insurance issuer is not liable for the payment of interest under 33-18-232(2) when the
9 health insurance issuer timely complies with the requirements of this subsection (6).
10 (7) (a) For purposes of this section, the period within which a determination must be made begins
11 on the date the request is received by the health insurance issuer in accordance with the health insurance
12 issuer's procedures, established pursuant to 33-32-207, for filing a request. The date the request is received by
13 the health insurance issuer must be counted without regard to whether all of the information necessary to make
14 the determination accompanies the filing of the request.
15 (b) If the period for making the determination under this section is extended due to the failure of
16 the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative to submit the information
17 necessary to make the determination, the period for making the determination is counted from the date on
18 which the health insurance issuer sends the notification of the extension to the covered person or, if applicable,
19 the covered person's authorized representative until the earlier of:
20 (i) the date on which the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized
21 representative responds to the request for additional information; or
22 (ii) the date on which the specified information was to have been submitted.
23 (c) If the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative fails to
24 submit the information before the end of the extension period, as specified in this section, the health insurance
25 issuer may deny the certification of the requested benefit.
26 (8) A notification of an adverse determination under this section must, in a manner calculated to be
27 understood by the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative, set forth:
28 (a) information sufficient to identify the benefit request or claim involved and, if applicable, the date
- 51 - Authorized Print Version – HB 60
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0060.2
1 of service, the health care provider, and the claim amount;
2 (b) a statement describing the availability, upon request, of the diagnosis code and its
3 corresponding meaning and the treatment code and its corresponding meaning. On receiving a request for a
4 diagnosis or treatment code, the health insurance issuer shall provide the information to the covered person or,
5 if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative as soon as practicable. A health insurance issuer
6 may not consider a request for the diagnosis code and treatment information, in itself, to be a request to file a
7 grievance for review of an adverse determination pursuant to Title 33, chapter 32, part 3, or a request for
8 external review as outlined in Title 33, chapter 32, part 4.
9 (c) the specific rationale behind the adverse determination, including the denial code and its
10 corresponding meaning, as well as a description of the health insurance issuer's standard, if any, that was used
11 in denying the benefit request or claim;
12 (d) a reference to the specific plan provision on which the determination is based;
13 (e) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the covered person or, if
14 applicable, the covered person's authorized representative to complete the benefit request, including an
15 explanation of why the material or information is necessary to complete the request;
16 (f) a description of the health insurance issuer's grievance procedures established pursuant to
17 Title 33, chapter 32, part 3, including any time limits applicable to those procedures;
18 (g) a copy of any internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criteria that the health insurance
19 issuer may have relied on to make the adverse determination. Alternatively, the health insurance issuer may
20 provide a statement that a specific rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criteria was relied on to make the
21 adverse determination and that a copy of the rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criteria will be provided
22 free of charge to the covered person on request.
23 (h) an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for making the adverse determination if the
24 adverse determination is based on a medical necessity or experimental or investigational treatment or similar
25 exclusion or limit. Alternatively, the health insurance issuer may provide a statement that an explanation will be
26 provided to the covered person free of charge on request. The explanation under this subsection (8)(h) must
27 apply the terms of the health plan to the covered person's medical circumstances.
28 (i) a statement explaining the availability of further assistance from the commissioner's office and
- 52 - Authorized Print Version – HB 60
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0060.2
1 the right of the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative to contact the
2 commissioner's office at any time for assistance or, on completion of the health insurance issuer's grievance
3 procedure and the external review process as provided under Title 33, chapter 32, parts 3 and 4, to file a civil
4 suit in a court of competent jurisdiction. The statement must include contact information for the commissioner's
5 office.
6 (9) (a) A health insurance issuer shall provide the notice required under this section in a culturally
7 and linguistically appropriate manner as required in accordance with federal regulations, including 45 CFR
8 147.136(e), and rules adopted pursuant to Title 33, chapter 32, part 3.
9 (b) To satisfy the provisions of subsection (9)(a), the health insurance issuer shall, at a minimum:
10 (i) provide oral language services, such as a telephone assistance hotline, that include answering
11 questions in any applicable non-English language and providing assistance with filing benefit requests, claims,
12 and appeals in any applicable non-English language;
13 (ii) provide, upon request, a notice in any applicable non-English language; and
14 (iii) include in the English version of the notice a prominently displayed statement in any applicable
15 non-English language clearly indicating how to access the language services provided by the health insurance
16 issuer.
17 (c) For purposes of this subsection (9), with respect to any United States county to which a notice
18 is sent, a non-English language is an applicable non-English language if 10% or more of the population residing
19 in the county is literate only in the same non-English language, as determined in federal guidance.
20 (10) If the adverse determination is a recission, the health insurance issuer shall provide, in addition
21 to any applicable disclosures required under this section, in a notice sent at least 30 days in advance of
22 implementing the rescission decision:
23 (a) clear identification of the alleged fraudulent act, practice, or omission or the intentional
24 misrepresentation of material fact;
25 (b) an explanation of why the act, practice, or omission was fraudulent or was an intentional
26 misrepresentation of a material fact;
27 (c) the date when the advance notice period ends and the date to which the coverage is to be
28 retroactively rescinded;
- 53 - Authorized Print Version – HB 60
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0060.2
1 (d) notice that the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative
2 may immediately file a grievance with the health insurance issuer requesting a review of the rescission; and

13 under this subsection (13), and the commissioner shall vacate any order when the deficiency has been
14 corrected; or
15 (k) has failed to reasonably supervise the person's salespersons or employees or investment
16 adviser representatives or employees to ensure their compliance with this act.
17 (14) The commissioner may not institute a suspension or revocation proceeding on the basis of a
18 fact or transaction known to the commissioner when registration became effective unless the proceeding is
19 instituted within 30 90 days after the date on which the registration became effective.
20 (15) The commissioner may by order summarily postpone or suspend registration pending final
21 determination of any proceeding under this section.
22 (16) Upon the entry of the order under subsection (13), the commissioner shall promptly notify the
23 applicant or registrant, as well as the employer or prospective employer if the applicant or registrant is a
24 salesperson or investment adviser representative, that it has been entered and of the reasons for the order and
25 that if requested by the applicant or registrant within 15 days after the receipt of the commissioner's notification,
26 the matter will be promptly set for hearing. If a hearing is not requested within 15 days and none is ordered by
27 the commissioner, the order will remain in effect until it is modified or vacated by the commissioner. If a hearing
28 is requested or ordered, the commissioner, after notice of and opportunity for hearing, may modify or vacate the
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 60

1 order or extend it until final determination.
2 (17) If the commissioner finds that a registrant or applicant for registration is no longer in existence
3 or has ceased to do business as a broker-dealer, salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser
4 representative or is subject to an adjudication of mental incompetence or to the control of a committee,
5 conservator, or guardian or cannot be located after reasonable search, the commissioner may by order cancel
6 the registration or application.
7 (18) The commissioner may, after suspending or revoking registration of any broker-dealer,
8 salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative, impose a fine not to exceed $5,000
9 upon the broker-dealer, salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative. The fine is in
10 addition to all other penalties imposed by the laws of this state and must be collected by the commissioner in
11 the name of the state of Montana and deposited in the general fund. Imposition of any fine under this
12 subsection is an order from which an appeal may be taken pursuant to 30-10-308. If any broker-dealer,
13 salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative fails to pay a fine referred to in this
14 subsection, the amount of the fine is a lien upon all of the assets and property of the broker-dealer,
15 salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative in this state and may be recovered by
16 suit by the commissioner and deposited in the general fund. Failure of a broker-dealer, salesperson, investment
17 adviser, or investment adviser representative to pay a fine also constitutes a forfeiture of the right to do
18 business in this state under parts 1 through 3 of this chapter.
19 (19) A sole proprietor registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser who does not employ
20 other salespersons or investment adviser representatives, other than the sole proprietor, is not required to
21 register as both a broker-dealer and a salesperson or as an investment adviser and an investment adviser
22 representative if the sole proprietor meets the examination requirements established by the commissioner by
23 rule.
24 (20) A person who is subject to the provisions of this section and who has passed the general
25 securities principal's examination is not required to also pass the uniform investment adviser law examination.
26 The commissioner shall by rule provide for a form that a person who passes the general securities principal's
27 examination shall file with the commissioner as a verification of having passed the examination unless the
28 commissioner can verify electronically that the person has passed the exam."

5 buying the security from the offeror or seller, who may sue either at law or in equity to recover the consideration
6 paid for the security, together with interest at 10% a year from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable
7 attorneys' fees, less the amount of any income received on the security, upon the tender of the security, or for
8 damages if the buyer no longer owns the security. Damages are the amount that would be recoverable upon a
9 tender less:
10 (a) the value of the security when the buyer disposed of it; and
11 (b) interest at 10% a year from the date of disposition.
12 (2) Every person who directly or indirectly controls a seller liable under subsection (1), every
13 partner, officer, or director (or person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions) or employee of
14 the seller, and every broker-dealer or salesperson who participates or materially aids in the sale is liable jointly
15 and severally with and to the same extent as the seller if the nonseller knew, or in the exercise of reasonable
16 care could have known, of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist. There
17 must be contribution among the several liable persons.
18 (3) Any tender specified in this section may be made at any time before entry of judgment. A cause
19 of action under this statute survives the death of any person who might have been a plaintiff or a defendant. A
20 person may not sue under this section if:
21 (a) the buyer has received a written offer, at a time when the buyer owned the security, to refund
22 the consideration paid, together with interest at 10% a year from the date of payment, less the amount of any
23 income received on the security and the buyer failed to accept the offer within 30 days of its receipt; or
24 (b) the buyer has received a written offer at a time when the buyer did not own the security in the
25 amount that would be recoverable under subsection (1) upon a tender less:
26 (i) the value of the security when the buyer disposed of it; and

2 has acquired any purported right under the contract with knowledge of the facts by reason of which its making
3 or performance was in violation may not base any suit on the contract. Any condition, stipulation, or provision
4 binding any person acquiring any security to waive compliance with any provision of parts 1 through 3 of this
5 chapter or any rule or order adopted under parts 1 through 3 of this chapter is void as against public policy and
6 in the public interest.
7 (5) (a) An action may not be maintained under this section to enforce any liability founded on a

10 (b) An action may not be maintained under this section to enforce any liability founded on fraud or
11 misrepresentation unless it is brought within 2 years after discovery of the fraud or misrepresentation on which

2 (b) a statement describing the availability, upon request, of the diagnosis code and its
3 corresponding meaning and the treatment code and its corresponding meaning. On receiving a request for a
4 diagnosis or treatment code, the health insurance issuer shall provide the information to the covered person or,
5 if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative as soon as practicable. A health insurance issuer
6 may not consider a request for the diagnosis code and treatment information, in itself, to be a request to file a

8 external review as outlined in Title 33, chapter 32, part 4.
9 (c) the specific rationale behind the adverse determination, including the denial code and its

17 Title 33, chapter 32, part 3, including any time limits applicable to those procedures;
18 (g) a copy of any internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criteria that the health insurance
19 issuer may have relied on to make the adverse determination. Alternatively, the health insurance issuer may
20 provide a statement that a specific rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criteria was relied on to make the
21 adverse determination and that a copy of the rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criteria will be provided
22 free of charge to the covered person on request.
23 (h) an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for making the adverse determination if the
24 adverse determination is based on a medical necessity or experimental or investigational treatment or similar
25 exclusion or limit. Alternatively, the health insurance issuer may provide a statement that an explanation will be

11 questions in any applicable non-English language and providing assistance with filing benefit requests, claims,
12 and appeals in any applicable non-English language;
13 (ii) provide, upon request, a notice in any applicable non-English language; and
14 (iii) include in the English version of the notice a prominently displayed statement in any applicable
15 non-English language clearly indicating how to access the language services provided by the health insurance
16 issuer.
17 (c) For purposes of this subsection (9), with respect to any United States county to which a notice
18 is sent, a non-English language is an applicable non-English language if 10% or more of the population residing
19 in the county is literate only in the same non-English language, as determined in federal guidance.
20 (10) If the adverse determination is a recission, the health insurance issuer shall provide, in addition
