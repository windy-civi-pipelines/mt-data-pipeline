21 (i) determines that an extension is necessary due to matters beyond the health insurance issuer's
22 control; and

24 prior to the expiration of the initial 30-day period, of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and of the
25 date by which the health insurance issuer expects to make a determination.
26 (d) If the extension under subsection (6)(c) is necessary because of the failure of the covered
27 person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative to submit information necessary to

3 least 45 days after the date of receipt of the notice to provide the specified information.
4 (e) A health insurance issuer is not liable for the payment of interest under 33-18-232(2) when the
5 health insurance issuer timely complies with the requirements of this subsection (6).
6 (7) (a) For purposes of this section, the period within which a determination must be made begins
7 on the date the request is received by the health insurance issuer in accordance with the health insurance
8 issuer's procedures, established pursuant to 33-32-207, for filing a request. The date the request is received by
9 the health insurance issuer must be counted without regard to whether all of the information necessary to make
10 the determination accompanies the filing of the request.
11 (b) If the period for making the determination under this section is extended due to the failure of
12 the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative to submit the information
13 necessary to make the determination, the period for making the determination is counted from the date on
14 which the health insurance issuer sends the notification of the extension to the covered person or, if applicable,
15 the covered person's authorized representative until the earlier of:
16 (i) the date on which the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized
17 representative responds to the request for additional information; or
18 (ii) the date on which the specified information was to have been submitted.
19 (c) If the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative fails to
20 submit the information before the end of the extension period, as specified in this section, the health insurance
21 issuer may deny the certification of the requested benefit.
22 (8) A notification of an adverse determination under this section must, in a manner calculated to be
23 understood by the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative, set forth:
24 (a) information sufficient to identify the benefit request or claim involved and, if applicable, the date
25 of service, the health care provider, and the claim amount;
26 (b) a statement describing the availability, upon request, of the diagnosis code and its

69th Legislature 2025 HB 60.1
1 if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative as soon as practicable. A health insurance issuer
2 may not consider a request for the diagnosis code and treatment information, in itself, to be a request to file a

4 external review as outlined in Title 33, chapter 32, part 4.
5 (c) the specific rationale behind the adverse determination, including the denial code and its

13 Title 33, chapter 32, part 3, including any time limits applicable to those procedures;

15 issuer may have relied on to make the adverse determination. Alternatively, the health insurance issuer may
16 provide a statement that a specific rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criteria was relied on to make the
17 adverse determination and that a copy of the rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criteria will be provided
18 free of charge to the covered person on request.
19 (h) an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for making the adverse determination if the
20 adverse determination is based on a medical necessity or experimental or investigational treatment or similar
21 exclusion or limit. Alternatively, the health insurance issuer may provide a statement that an explanation will be
22 provided to the covered person free of charge on request. The explanation under this subsection (8)(h) must
23 apply the terms of the health plan to the covered person's medical circumstances.
24 (i) a statement explaining the availability of further assistance from the commissioner's office and
25 the right of the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative to contact the
