against a broker-dealer or investment adviser under this subsection (13) without a finding of insolvency as to
the broker-dealer or investment adviser;
(i) has not complied with a condition imposed by the commissioner under this section or is not
qualified on the basis of such factors as training, experience, or knowledge of the securities business;
(j) has failed to pay the proper filing fee, but the commissioner may enter only a denial order

that if requested by the applicant or registrant within 15 days after the receipt of the commissioner's notification,

(18) The commissioner may, after suspending or revoking registration of any broker-dealer,

addition to all other penalties imposed by the laws of this state and must be collected by the commissioner in
the name of the state of Montana and deposited in the general fund. Imposition of any fine under this
subsection is an order from which an appeal may be taken pursuant to 30-10-308. If any broker-dealer,
salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative fails to pay a fine referred to in this
subsection, the amount of the fine is a lien upon all of the assets and property of the broker-dealer,
salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative in this state and may be recovered by
suit by the commissioner and deposited in the general fund. Failure of a broker-dealer, salesperson, investment
adviser, or investment adviser representative to pay a fine also constitutes a forfeiture of the right to do
business in this state under parts 1 through 3 of this chapter.
(19) A sole proprietor registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser who does not employ
other salespersons or investment adviser representatives, other than the sole proprietor, is not required to

rule.

The commissioner shall by rule provide for a form that a person who passes the general securities principal's
examination shall file with the commissioner as a verification of having passed the examination unless the
commissioner can verify electronically that the person has passed the exam."

violation of 30-10-202 or offers or sells a security by means of fraud or misrepresentation is liable to the person
buying the security from the offeror or seller, who may sue either at law or in equity to recover the consideration
paid for the security, together with interest at 10% a year from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable
attorneys' fees, less the amount of any income received on the security, upon the tender of the security, or for
damages if the buyer no longer owns the security. Damages are the amount that would be recoverable upon a
tender less:
(a) the value of the security when the buyer disposed of it; and
(b) interest at 10% a year from the date of disposition.
(2) Every person who directly or indirectly controls a seller liable under subsection (1), every
partner, officer, or director (or person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions) or employee of
the seller, and every broker-dealer or salesperson who participates or materially aids in the sale is liable jointly
and severally with and to the same extent as the seller if the nonseller knew, or in the exercise of reasonable
care could have known, of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist. There
must be contribution among the several liable persons.
(3) Any tender specified in this section may be made at any time before entry of judgment. A cause
of action under this statute survives the death of any person who might have been a plaintiff or a defendant. A
person may not sue under this section if:
(a) the buyer has received a written offer, at a time when the buyer owned the security, to refund
the consideration paid, together with interest at 10% a year from the date of payment, less the amount of any
income received on the security and the buyer failed to accept the offer within 30 days of its receipt; or

amount that would be recoverable under subsection (1) upon a tender less:
(i) the value of the security when the buyer disposed of it; and
(ii) interest at 10% a year from the date of disposition.

binding any person acquiring any security to waive compliance with any provision of parts 1 through 3 of this
chapter or any rule or order adopted under parts 1 through 3 of this chapter is void as against public policy and
in the public interest.
(5) (a) An action may not be maintained under this section to enforce any liability founded on a

"33-22-906. Loss ratio standards and filing requirements -- limits on compensation. (1)
Medicare supplement policies and certificates must return to policyholders or certificate holders benefits that
are reasonable in relation to the premium charged. The commissioner shall adopt reasonable rules to establish
minimum standards for loss ratios of medicare supplement policies and certificates on the basis of incurred
claims experience or incurred health care expenses, where coverage is provided by a health maintenance
organization on a service rather than reimbursement basis, and earned premiums for the entire period for which
rates are computed to provide coverage and in accordance with accepted actuarial principles and practices.
Every entity issuer providing medicare supplement insurance benefits to a resident of this state shall make
premium adjustments:
(a) necessary to produce an expected loss ratio under the policy or certificate that meets the
minimum loss ratio standards for medicare supplement policies and certificates as established by rule; and
(b) expected to result in a loss ratio at least as great as that originally anticipated by the entity
issuer when it established current premiums for the medicare supplement policy or certificate.
(2) The commissioner shall by rule establish the timing and manner of the premium adjustments.
Every entity issuer providing medicare supplement policies or certificates in this state shall annually file with the
commissioner its rates, rating schedule, and supporting documentation demonstrating that it is in compliance
with the applicable loss ratio standards of this part. An entity issuer transacting medicare supplement insurance
in this state may not adjust its rates more than twice a year and may not adjust its rates for the first year a
policy is in force, except to allow for changes in federal laws or regulations relating to medicare. Each filing of
rates and rating schedules must demonstrate that the actual and expected losses in relation to premiums
complies with the requirements of this part.
(3) An entity issuer may not provide compensation to its insurance producers that is greater than
the renewal compensation that would be paid on an existing policy or certificate if:
(a) the existing policy or certificate were replaced by another policy or certificate with the same
- 42 - Authorized Print Version – HB 60
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025

delivered to the applicant at the time that application is made. The outline of coverage must be filed with the
commissioner as required by 33-1-501. The filing must be made at least 60 days in advance of the date that the
outline of coverage is delivered to any resident of this state.

change premiums and disclosure of the existence of any automatic renewal premium increases based on the
policyholder's or certificate holder's age;
(iv) a statement that the outline of coverage is a summary of the policy or certificate issued or
applied for and that the policy or certificate should be consulted to determine governing contractual provisions.
(3) The commissioner may prescribe by rule a standard form and the contents of an informational
brochure for persons eligible for medicare, which is intended to improve the buyer's ability to select the most
appropriate coverage and to improve the buyer's understanding of medicare. Except in the case of direct
response insurance policies, the commissioner may require by rule that the information brochure be provided to
- 43 - Authorized Print Version – HB 60

any prospective insureds eligible for medicare at the same time that the outline of coverage is delivered. With
respect to direct response insurance policies, the commissioner may require by rule that the prescribed
brochure be provided upon request, but not later than the time of policy delivery, to any prospective insureds
eligible for medicare.
(4) The commissioner may adopt reasonable rules for captions or notice requirements, determined
to be in the public interest and designed to inform prospective insureds that particular insurance coverages are
not medicare supplement coverages, for all accident and sickness insurance policies sold to persons eligible for
medicare, other than:
(a) medicare supplement policies or certificates; or
(b) disability income policies.
(5) The commissioner may further adopt reasonable rules to govern the full and fair disclosure of
the information in connection with the replacement of accident and sickness policies or certificates by persons
eligible for medicare.

69th Legislature 2025 HB0060
premium for the alternate policy or certificate on the rates currently in place for that policy or certificate.

supplement policy or certificate, any period of time that was covered by that policy or certificate must be
credited toward the preexisting condition limitation period of the replacing policy or certificate."

the matter will be promptly set for hearing. If a hearing is not requested within 15 days and none is ordered by

(18) The commissioner may, after suspending or revoking registration of any broker-dealer,

upon the broker-dealer, salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative. The fine is in
addition to all other penalties imposed by the laws of this state and must be collected by the commissioner in
the name of the state of Montana and deposited in the general fund. Imposition of any fine under this
subsection is an order from which an appeal may be taken pursuant to 30-10-308. If any broker-dealer,
salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative fails to pay a fine referred to in this
subsection, the amount of the fine is a lien upon all of the assets and property of the broker-dealer,
salesperson, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative in this state and may be recovered by
suit by the commissioner and deposited in the general fund. Failure of a broker-dealer, salesperson, investment
adviser, or investment adviser representative to pay a fine also constitutes a forfeiture of the right to do

(19) A sole proprietor registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser who does not employ
other salespersons or investment adviser representatives, other than the sole proprietor, is not required to

The commissioner shall by rule provide for a form that a person who passes the general securities principal's
examination shall file with the commissioner as a verification of having passed the examination unless the
commissioner can verify electronically that the person has passed the exam."

violation of 30-10-202 or offers or sells a security by means of fraud or misrepresentation is liable to the person
buying the security from the offeror or seller, who may sue either at law or in equity to recover the consideration
paid for the security, together with interest at 10% a year from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable
attorneys' fees, less the amount of any income received on the security, upon the tender of the security, or for
damages if the buyer no longer owns the security. Damages are the amount that would be recoverable upon a
tender less:
(a) the value of the security when the buyer disposed of it; and
(b) interest at 10% a year from the date of disposition.
(2) Every person who directly or indirectly controls a seller liable under subsection (1), every
partner, officer, or director (or person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions) or employee of
the seller, and every broker-dealer or salesperson who participates or materially aids in the sale is liable jointly
and severally with and to the same extent as the seller if the nonseller knew, or in the exercise of reasonable
care could have known, of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist. There
must be contribution among the several liable persons.
(3) Any tender specified in this section may be made at any time before entry of judgment. A cause
of action under this statute survives the death of any person who might have been a plaintiff or a defendant. A
person may not sue under this section if:
(a) the buyer has received a written offer, at a time when the buyer owned the security, to refund
the consideration paid, together with interest at 10% a year from the date of payment, less the amount of any
income received on the security and the buyer failed to accept the offer within 30 days of its receipt; or
(b) the buyer has received a written offer at a time when the buyer did not own the security in the
amount that would be recoverable under subsection (1) upon a tender less:
(i) the value of the security when the buyer disposed of it; and
(ii) interest at 10% a year from the date of disposition.
(4) A person who has made or engaged in the performance of any contract in violation of any
provision of parts 1 through 3 of this chapter or any rule or order under parts 1 through 3 of this chapter or who
has acquired any purported right under the contract with knowledge of the facts by reason of which its making

or performance was in violation may not base any suit on the contract. Any condition, stipulation, or provision
binding any person acquiring any security to waive compliance with any provision of parts 1 through 3 of this
chapter or any rule or order adopted under parts 1 through 3 of this chapter is void as against public policy and
in the public interest.
(5) (a) An action may not be maintained under this section to enforce any liability founded on a
violation of 30-10-202 unless it is brought within 2 years after the violation occurs 1 year after discovery of the
violation or after the discovery should have been made by exercise of reasonable diligence.

misrepresentation unless it is brought within 2 years after discovery of the fraud or misrepresentation on which

withdrawal of approval does not take effect unless it is issued after the commissioner has reviewed the form
and provided notice to the person who filed the form pursuant to 33-1-314 and this subsection.

Medicare supplement policies and certificates must return to policyholders or certificate holders benefits that
are reasonable in relation to the premium charged. The commissioner shall adopt reasonable rules to establish
minimum standards for loss ratios of medicare supplement policies and certificates on the basis of incurred
claims experience or incurred health care expenses, where coverage is provided by a health maintenance
organization on a service rather than reimbursement basis, and earned premiums for the entire period for which
rates are computed to provide coverage and in accordance with accepted actuarial principles and practices.
Every entity issuer providing medicare supplement insurance benefits to a resident of this state shall make
premium adjustments:
(a) necessary to produce an expected loss ratio under the policy or certificate that meets the
minimum loss ratio standards for medicare supplement policies and certificates as established by rule; and
(b) expected to result in a loss ratio at least as great as that originally anticipated by the entity
issuer when it established current premiums for the medicare supplement policy or certificate.
(2) The commissioner shall by rule establish the timing and manner of the premium adjustments.
Every entity issuer providing medicare supplement policies or certificates in this state shall annually file with the
commissioner its rates, rating schedule, and supporting documentation demonstrating that it is in compliance
with the applicable loss ratio standards of this part. An entity issuer transacting medicare supplement insurance
in this state may not adjust its rates more than twice a year and may not adjust its rates for the first year a
policy is in force, except to allow for changes in federal laws or regulations relating to medicare. Each filing of
rates and rating schedules must demonstrate that the actual and expected losses in relation to premiums
complies with the requirements of this part.
(3) An entity issuer may not provide compensation to its insurance producers that is greater than
the renewal compensation that would be paid on an existing policy or certificate if:
(a) the existing policy or certificate were replaced by another policy or certificate with the same
