12
13 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Requirements for attorney fee award request -- awards against
14 state. (1) An award of attorney fees IN CASES CHALLENGING A STATE STATUTE OR ADMINISTRATIVE RULE must be
15 reasonable. A reasonable claim for attorney fees must include the following:
16 (a) the date a task is performed and the name of the timekeeper;
17 (b) a specific description of the task, including but not limited to the nature, purpose, or subject of

1 responsible for paying a portion of the bill if the attorney does not collect the award.
2 (2) There is a rebuttable presumption that the following are unreasonable requests for attorney
3 fees:
4 (a) sending more than one attorney to a deposition;
5 (b) sending more than two attorneys to an oral argument or trial;
6 (c) charging for the cost of telephone calls, faxes, library facilities, or electronic research
7 subscriptions; and
8 (d) charging an hourly rate greater than the statewide average if the attorney has not been
9 practicing for more than 10 years.
10 (3) In addition to the requirements imposed by subsections (1) and (2), when considering an award
11 of attorney fees against the state, the court shall take into consideration the hourly rate charged by the attorney
12 representing the state. If the court elects to grant a rate higher than the rate charged by the attorney
13 representing the state, the court shall provide an explanation as to why the rate charged by the state does not
14 adequately compensate the attorney for which attorney fees are requested.
15 (4) In determining the reasonableness of an award of attorney fees, a court may consider factors
16 other than those contained in this section.

21 of the state or a political subdivision, the opposing party, whether plaintiff or defendant, is entitled to the costs
22 enumerated in 25-10-201 and reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court if:
23 (a) the opposing party prevails against the state, political subdivision, or agency; and
24 (b) the court finds that the claim or defense of the state, political subdivision, or agency that
25 brought or defended the action was frivolous or pursued in bad faith.
26 (2) Costs may be granted pursuant to subsection (1) notwithstanding any other provision of the law
27 to the contrary. The award of costs must be reasonable and considered under [section 1]."
