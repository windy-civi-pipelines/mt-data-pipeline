of attorney fees against the state, the court shall take into consideration the hourly rate charged by the attorney
representing the state. If the court elects to grant a rate higher than the rate charged by the attorney
representing the state, the court shall provide an explanation as to why the rate charged by the state does not
adequately compensate the attorney for which attorney fees are requested.

other than those contained in this section.

$10,000.

of the state or a political subdivision, the opposing party, whether plaintiff or defendant, is entitled to the costs
enumerated in 25-10-201 and reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court if:
