1 (g) an indication of whether a portion of the attorney fee has been paid and whether the client is
2 responsible for paying a portion of the bill if the attorney does not collect the award.
3 (2) There is a rebuttable presumption that the following are unreasonable requests for attorney
4 fees:
5 (a) sending more than one attorney to a deposition;
6 (b) sending more than two attorneys to an oral argument or trial;
7 (c) charging for THE COST OF telephone calls, faxes, library facilities, or electronic research

10 practicing for more than 10 years.
11 (3) In addition to the requirements imposed by subsections (1) and (2), when considering an award
12 of attorney fees against the state, the court shall take into consideration the hourly rate charged by the attorney
13 representing the state. If the court elects to grant a rate higher than the rate charged by the attorney
14 representing the state, the court shall provide an explanation as to why the rate charged by the state does not
15 adequately compensate the attorney for which attorney fees are requested.
16 (4) In determining the reasonableness of an award of attorney fees, a court may consider factors
17 other than those contained in this section.
18 (5) The provisions of this section do not apply to claims for attorney fees for an amount less than
19 $10,000.
