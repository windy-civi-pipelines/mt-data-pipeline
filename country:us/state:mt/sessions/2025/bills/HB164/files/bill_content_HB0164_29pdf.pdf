69th Legislature 2025 HB0164.2
1 (2) At the time that an interest is presumed abandoned under subsection (1), any other property
2 right accrued or accruing to the owner as a result of the interest, and not previously presumed abandoned, is
3 also presumed abandoned.
4 (3) Property is unclaimed if, for the applicable period set forth in subsection (1), the apparent
5 owner has not communicated in writing or by other means reflected in a contemporaneous record prepared by
6 or on behalf of the holder with the holder concerning the property or the account in which the property is held
7 and has not otherwise indicated an interest in the property. A communication with an owner by a person other
8 than the holder or its representative who has not in writing identified the property to the owner is not an
9 indication of interest in the property by the owner.
10 (4) An indication of an owner's interest in property includes:
11 (a) the presentment of a check or other instrument of payment of a dividend or other distribution
12 made with respect to an account or underlying stock or other interest in a business association or financial
13 organization or, in the case of a distribution made by electronic or similar means, evidence that the distribution
14 has been received;
15 (b) owner-directed activity in the account in which the property is held, including a direction by the
16 owner to increase, decrease, or change the amount or type of property held in the account;
17 (c) the making of a deposit to or withdrawal from an account in a financial organization; and
18 (d) the payment of a premium with respect to a property interest in an insurance policy; however,
19 the application of an automatic premium loan provision or other nonforfeiture provision contained in an
20 insurance policy does not prevent a policy from maturing or terminating if the insured has died or the insured or
21 the beneficiary of the policy has otherwise become entitled to the proceeds before the depletion of the cash
22 surrender value of a policy by the application of those provisions.
23 (5)(3) Property is payable or distributable for purposes of this part notwithstanding the owner's failure
24 to make demand or present an instrument or document otherwise required to obtain payment.
25 (4) The period after which property is presumed abandoned is measured from the later of:
26 (a) the date the property is presumed abandoned under subsection (1); or
27 (b) the latest indication of interest by the apparent owner in the property.
28 (5)(4) An indication of an apparent owner's interest in property includes:
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – HB 164

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0164.2
1 (a) a record communicated by the apparent owner to the holder or agent of the holder concerning
2 the property or the account in which the property is held;
3 (b) an oral communication by the apparent owner to the holder or agent of the holder concerning
4 the property or the account in which the property is held, if the holder or agent contemporaneously makes and
5 preserves a record of the fact of the apparent owner's communication;
6 (c) presentment of a check or other instrument of payment of a dividend, interest payment, or other
7 distribution, or evidence of receipt of a distribution made by electronic or similar means, with respect to an
8 account, underlying security, or interest in a business association;
9 (d) activity directed by an apparent owner in the account in which the property is held, including
10 accessing the account or information concerning the account, or a direction by the apparent owner to increase,
11 decrease, or otherwise change the amount or type of property held in the account;
12 (e) a deposit in or withdrawal from an account at a financial organization, including an automatic
13 deposit or withdrawal previously authorized by the apparent owner other than an automatic reinvestment of
14 dividends or interest;
15 (f) subject to subsection (8) (7), payment of a premium on an insurance policy;
16 (g) any other action by the apparent owner that reasonably demonstrates to the holder that the
17 apparent owner knows that the property exists.
18 (6)(5) An action by an agent or other representative of an apparent owner, other than the holder
19 acting as the apparent owner's agent, is presumed to be an action on behalf of the apparent owner.
20 (7)(6) A communication with an apparent owner by a person other than the holder or the holder's
21 representative is not an indication of interest in the property by the apparent owner unless a record of the
22 communication evidences the apparent owner's knowledge of a right to the property.
23 (8)(7) If the insured dies or the insured or beneficiary of an insurance policy otherwise becomes
24 entitled to the proceeds before depletion of the cash surrender value of the policy by operation of an automatic
25 premium loan provision or other nonforfeiture provision contained in the policy, the operation does not prevent
26 the policy from maturing or terminating.
27 (6)(9)(8) The presumption provided in subsection (1) does not apply to:
28 (a) unclaimed patronage refunds of a rural electric or telephone cooperative if the cooperative
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – HB 164

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0164.2
1 uses the refunds exclusively for educational purposes; or
2 (b) unclaimed shares in a nonutility cooperative if the cooperative uses the shares for charitable or
3 civic purposes in the community in which the cooperative is located.
4 (7)(10)(9) For the purposes of As used in this section, "inflation factor" means a number
5 determined for each tax year by dividing the consumer price index for June of the previous tax year by the
6 consumer price index for June 2015."
