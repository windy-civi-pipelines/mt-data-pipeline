69th Legislature 2025 HB 664
REMOVING REFERENCES TO NUMERIC NUTRIENT STANDARDS IN ADMINISTRATIVE RULE;
REPEALING BASE NUMERIC NUTRIENT STANDARDS; PROVIDING DIRECTIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT
OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY; PROVIDING RULEMAKING AUTHORITY; ELIMINATING THE NUTRIENT
WORK GROUP; AMENDING SECTION 75-5-103, MCA; REPEALING SECTION 75-5-321, MCA; AND
PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE.
WHEREAS, the objective of the Clean Water Act is to "restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and
biological integrity of the Nation's waters"; and
WHEREAS, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authorized the Montana Department of
Environmental Quality (DEQ) to regulate most water quality programs in the state; and
WHEREAS, beginning in 1998, the EPA "strongly encouraged" numeric nutrient standards, which the
DEQ adopted in 2015; and
WHEREAS, from 2011 through 2014, members of the Nutrient Work Group and the public endeavored
to develop rules to govern numeric nutrient criteria, rules, and guidance. The work involved interactions
between the DEQ and EPA on the proposed rules, variances, and guidance and led to the adoption of rule
packages by the Board of Environmental Review. Even though the EPA had clarity on the proposals before
they were finalized and had indicated its support for Montana's approach, the agency adopted a rule that made
it impossible for Montana's rules and variances from working as intended. The EPA never approved a general
variance for private sector dischargers; and
WHEREAS, these numeric nutrient standards were not explicitly required by law, and many states have
not adopted numeric nutrient standards for all of their bodies of water; and
WHEREAS, the 2021 Montana Legislature, recognizing this, chose to re-establish narrative nutrient
standards in Senate Bill 358; and

69th Legislature 2025 HB 664
WHEREAS, the Nutrient Work Group, which included participants from the DEQ and EPA, worked
diligently to assess the viability of a general variance to allow compliance with numeric standards and to
develop narrative standards without widespread economic consequences, but to no avail; and
WHEREAS, the failure to adopt narrative nutrient standards means that Montana again operates under
the old, unattainable numeric nutrient standards; and
WHEREAS, Montana's numeric nutrient standards and variances provided for in law and in ARM

69th Legislature 2025 HB 664
AN ACT REVISING THE NUTRIENT CRITERIA FOR MONTANA WATER QUALITY STANDARDS;
REMOVING REFERENCES TO NUMERIC NUTRIENT STANDARDS IN ADMINISTRATIVE RULE;
REPEALING BASE NUMERIC NUTRIENT STANDARDS; PROVIDING DIRECTIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT
OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY; PROVIDING RULEMAKING AUTHORITY; ELIMINATING THE NUTRIENT
WORK GROUP; AMENDING SECTION 75-5-103, MCA; REPEALING SECTION 75-5-321, MCA; AND
PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE.
WHEREAS, the objective of the Clean Water Act is to "restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and
biological integrity of the Nation's waters"; and
WHEREAS, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authorized the Montana Department of
Environmental Quality (DEQ) to regulate most water quality programs in the state; and
WHEREAS, beginning in 1998, the EPA "strongly encouraged" numeric nutrient standards, which the
DEQ adopted in 2015; and
WHEREAS, from 2011 through 2014, members of the Nutrient Work Group and the public endeavored
to develop rules to govern numeric nutrient criteria, rules, and guidance. The work involved interactions
between the DEQ and EPA on the proposed rules, variances, and guidance and led to the adoption of rule
packages by the Board of Environmental Review. Even though the EPA had clarity on the proposals before
they were finalized and had indicated its support for Montana's approach, the agency adopted a rule that made
it impossible for Montana's rules and variances from working as intended. The EPA never approved a general
variance for private sector dischargers; and
WHEREAS, these numeric nutrient standards were not explicitly required by law, and many states have
not adopted numeric nutrient standards for all of their bodies of water; and
WHEREAS, the 2021 Montana Legislature, recognizing this, chose to re-establish narrative nutrient
standards in Senate Bill 358; and

69th Legislature 2025 HB 664
WHEREAS, the Nutrient Work Group, which included participants from the DEQ and EPA, worked
diligently to assess the viability of a general variance to allow compliance with numeric standards and to
develop narrative standards without widespread economic consequences, but to no avail; and
WHEREAS, the failure to adopt narrative nutrient standards means that Montana again operates under
the old, unattainable numeric nutrient standards; and
WHEREAS, Montana's numeric nutrient standards and variances provided for in law and in ARM
17.30.507, 17.30.516, 17.30.602, 17.30.619, 17.30.622, 17.30.623, 17.30.624, 17.30.625, 17.30.626,

to be unachievable and burdensome, especially for Montana's municipal wastewater treatment systems.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
Section 1. Department to amend rules. The department shall amend ARM 17.30.507, 17.30.516,

17.30.629, 17.30.702, and 17.30.715 to delete all references to department circular DEQ-12A, base numeric
nutrient standards, and nutrient standards variances.
Section 2. Directions to department. The department shall:
