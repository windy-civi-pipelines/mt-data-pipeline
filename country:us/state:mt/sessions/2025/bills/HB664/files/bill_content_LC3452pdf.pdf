4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT REVISING THE NUTRIENT CRITERIA FOR MONTANA WATER
5 QUALITY STANDARDS; REMOVING REFERENCES TO NUMERIC NUTRIENT STANDARDS IN
6 ADMINISTRATIVE RULE; REPEALING BASE NUMERIC NUTRIENT STANDARDS; PROVIDING
7 DIRECTIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY; PROVIDING RULEMAKING
8 AUTHORITY; ELIMINATING THE NUTRIENT WORK GROUP; AMENDING SECTION 75-5-103, MCA;
9 REPEALING SECTION 75-5-321, MCA; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE.”

11 WHEREAS, the objective of the Clean Water Act is to "restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and
12 biological integrity of the Nation's waters"; and
13 WHEREAS, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authorized the Montana Department of
14 Environmental Quality (DEQ) to regulate most water quality programs in the state; and
15 WHEREAS, beginning in 1998, the EPA "strongly encouraged" numeric nutrient standards, which the
16 DEQ adopted in 2015; and
17 WHEREAS, from 2011 through 2014, members of the Nutrient Work Group and the public endeavored
18 to develop rules to govern numeric nutrient criteria, rules, and guidance. The work involved interactions
19 between the DEQ and EPA on the proposed rules, variances, and guidance and led to the adoption of rule
20 packages by the Board of Environmental Review. Even though the EPA had clarity on the proposals before
21 they were finalized and had indicated its support for Montana's approach, the agency adopted a rule that made
22 it impossible for Montana's rules and variances from working as intended. The EPA never approved a general
23 variance for private sector dischargers; and
24 WHEREAS, these numeric nutrient standards were not explicitly required by law, and many states have
25 not adopted numeric nutrient standards for all of their bodies of water; and
26 WHEREAS, the 2021 Montana Legislature, recognizing this, chose to re-establish narrative nutrient
27 standards in Senate Bill 358; and
28 WHEREAS, the Nutrient Work Group, which included participants from the DEQ and EPA, worked
- 1 - LC 3452

69th Legislature 2025 LC 3452
1 diligently to assess the viability of a general variance to allow compliance with numeric standards and to
2 develop narrative standards without widespread economic consequences, but to no avail; and
3 WHEREAS, the failure to adopt narrative nutrient standards means that Montana again operates under
4 the old, unattainable numeric nutrient standards; and
5 WHEREAS, Montana's numeric nutrient standards and variances provided for in law and in ARM
6 17.30.507, 17.30.516, 17.30.602, 17.30.619, 17.30.622, 17.30.623, 17.30.624, 17.30.625, 17.30.626,

8 to be unachievable and burdensome, especially for Montana's municipal wastewater treatment systems.
