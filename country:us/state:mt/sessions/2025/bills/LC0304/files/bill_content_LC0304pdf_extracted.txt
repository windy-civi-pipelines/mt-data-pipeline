8 (a) the name and business address of each party to the health care contract;
9 (b) an identification of each location at which any party to the agreement or policy provides health
10 care services; and

13 means that are less restrictive.
14 (2) The department shall approve or deny a waiver application in writing within 60 days of receiving
15 the application.
16 (3) The department may approve a waiver to allow a contract to include a provision specified in
17 [section 2(1)] only if the department determines:
18 (a) the agreement or policy will result in an increase in the welfare of consumers in the state in a
19 way that ensures the procompetitive justifications of including the provision outweigh the harms to competition;
20 (b) an increase in the welfare of consumers in the state could not have been accomplished
21 through alternative means that are less restrictive; and
22 (c) the agreement or policy does not otherwise constitute a contract, combination, or conspiracy in
23 restraint of trade under state or federal antitrust laws.
24 (4) Except for contracts granted a waiver under this section by the department, any provision of a
25 health care contract described in [section 2(1)] that violates [sections 1 through 8] is null and void and
26 unenforceable. The remaining provisions of the health care contract, excluding any provision in violation of
27 [sections 1 through 8], remain in effect and are enforceable.
