11 A RESOLUTION OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF MONTANA DESIGNATING
12 THE WEEK OF APRIL 14, 2025, AS TWO LIGHTS FOR TOMORROW WEEK IN MONTANA.
13
14 WHEREAS, the Montana House of Representatives recognizes the importance of honoring and
15 commemorating the 250th anniversary of the founding of our nation and reminding our citizens of the vital
16 significance and relevance of our founding principles and ideals that created a unique national identity worth
17 fighting for; and
18 WHEREAS, the events of 1775 that began the revolution the year before independence was declared
19 are significant moments that signaled the creation of a national identity and unity of purpose that transcended
20 traditional geographic, cultural, and societal divides; and
21 WHEREAS, individuals and communities across all of the colonies came together to support their
22 fellow countrymen; and
23 WHEREAS, on the evening of April 18, 1775, with impending hostile action from the British army in
24 Boston, Massachusetts, Paul Revere and William Dawes, along with other alarm riders, undertook a perilous
25 ride to alert everyone in the countryside of the coming danger; and
26 WHEREAS, preceding their departure from Boston, a prearranged signal was set in the Old North
27 Church steeple to ensure that the message got out and did not solely rely on just one or two alarm riders; and
28 WHEREAS, the two lanterns that were the signal were immortalized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – HR 5
69th Legislature 2025 HR 5.1
1 poem "Paul Revere's Ride" as "one if by land, and two if by sea" and have become an enduring symbol of
2 American vigilance, perseverance, and preparedness in the face of adversity; and
3 WHEREAS, those alarm riders and the citizens who answered the call to arms to serve and defend
4 their fellow countrymen that night and the following day at the battles of Lexington and Concord exemplify the
5 spirit of community and shared responsibility that has defined our nation since its inception; and
6 WHEREAS, we are reminded, 250 years later, that the call for unity and the call to serve each other is
7 no less relevant today than it was in 1775; and
8 WHEREAS, a national initiative has been proposed that two lights be displayed in public spaces across
9 the country for all to see, marking that significant anniversary in April 2025 and the beginning of the 250th
10 anniversary commemorations leading up to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July
11 4, 2026; and
12 WHEREAS, state commissions, state governments, federal agencies, and community, heritage, and
13 historical organizations across the country, including the Montana 250th Commission, have eagerly endorsed
14 the initiative, have pledged to support it and participate in it, and have encouraged others to do the same; and
15 WHEREAS, some participating agencies have also pledged to encourage a day of community service
16 on April 19, 2025, as a way to encourage understanding about the true meaning of these historical
17 commemorations, knowing that these events are not just marking history for history's sake but rather
18 encouraging reflection on the idea that all of these historic events were endeavoring toward one common goal:
19 the chance for a better tomorrow, together.
20
21 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
22 MONTANA:
23 That the Montana House of Representatives proclaims the week of April 14, 2025, as Two Lights for
24 Tomorrow Week and calls on all citizens to unite in remembrance of our shared history, honoring the sacrifices
25 made by those who fought for our independence and reminding ourselves of the values we hold dear today.
26 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Montana House of Representatives encourages all government
27 buildings, community centers, museums, public spaces, historic preservation entities, and citizens to take part
28 in this symbolic commemoration by prominently displaying two lights for all to see during the night of April 18,
