4 A RESOLUTION OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF MONTANA DESIGNATING
5 THE WEEK OF APRIL 14, 2025, AS TWO LIGHTS FOR TOMORROW WEEK IN MONTANA.
6
7 WHEREAS, the Montana House of Representatives recognizes the importance of honoring and
8 commemorating the 250th anniversary of the founding of our nation and reminding our citizens of the vital
9 significance and relevance of our founding principles and ideals that created a unique national identity worth
10 fighting for; and
11 WHEREAS, the events of 1775 that began the revolution the year before independence was declared
12 are significant moments that signaled the creation of a national identity and unity of purpose that transcended
13 traditional geographic, cultural, and societal divides; and
14 WHEREAS, individuals and communities across all of the colonies came together to support their
15 fellow countrymen; and
16 WHEREAS, on the evening of April 18, 1775, with impending hostile action from the British army in
17 Boston, Massachusetts, Paul Revere and William Dawes, along with other alarm riders, undertook a perilous
18 ride to alert everyone in the countryside of the coming danger; and
19 WHEREAS, preceding their departure from Boston, a prearranged signal was set in the Old North
20 Church steeple to ensure that the message got out and did not solely rely on just one or two alarm riders; and
21 WHEREAS, the two lanterns that were the signal were immortalized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's
22 poem "Paul Revere's Ride" as "one if by land, and two if by sea" and have become an enduring symbol of
23 American vigilance, perseverance, and preparedness in the face of adversity; and
24 WHEREAS, those alarm riders and the citizens who answered the call to arms to serve and defend
25 their fellow countrymen that night and the following day at the battles of Lexington and Concord exemplify the
26 spirit of community and shared responsibility that has defined our nation since its inception; and
27 WHEREAS, we are reminded, 250 years later, that the call for unity and the call to serve each other is
28 no less relevant today than it was in 1775; and

69th Legislature 2025 LC 3381
1 WHEREAS, a national initiative has been proposed that two lights be displayed in public spaces across
2 the country for all to see, marking that significant anniversary in April 2025 and the beginning of the 250th
3 anniversary commemorations leading up to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July
4 4, 2026; and
5 WHEREAS, state commissions, state governments, federal agencies, and community, heritage, and
6 historical organizations across the country, including the Montana 250th Commission, have eagerly endorsed
7 the initiative, have pledged to support it and participate in it, and have encouraged others to do the same; and
8 WHEREAS, some participating agencies have also pledged to encourage a day of community service
9 on April 19, 2025, as a way to encourage understanding about the true meaning of these historical
10 commemorations, knowing that these events are not just marking history for history's sake but rather
11 encouraging reflection on the idea that all of these historic events were endeavoring toward one common goal:
12 the chance for a better tomorrow, together.
13
14 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
15 MONTANA:
16 That the Montana House of Representatives proclaims the week of April 14, 2025, as Two Lights for
17 Tomorrow Week and calls on all citizens to unite in remembrance of our shared history, honoring the sacrifices
18 made by those who fought for our independence and reminding ourselves of the values we hold dear today.
19 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Montana House of Representatives encourages all government
20 buildings, community centers, museums, public spaces, historic preservation entities, and citizens to take part
21 in this symbolic commemoration by prominently displaying two lights for all to see during the night of April 18,
22 2025, and to reflect on how those lights shining out in the darkness during this vigil symbolically illustrate our
23 ongoing journey as a nation.
