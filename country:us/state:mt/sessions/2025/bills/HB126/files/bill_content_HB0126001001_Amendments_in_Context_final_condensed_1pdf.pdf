7 Section 2. Section 2-4-302, MCA, is amended to read:

9 repeal of any rule, the agency shall give written notice of its proposed action. The proposal notice must include
10 a statement of either the terms or substance of the intended action or a description of the subjects and issues

13 written in plain, easily understood language.
14 (b) The agency shall state in the proposal notice the date on which and the manner in which
15 contact was made with the primary sponsor as required in subsection (2)(e). If the notification to the primary
16 sponsor was given by mail, the date stated in the proposal notice must be the date on which the notification
17 was mailed by the agency. If the agency fails to comply with the primary sponsor notification and sponsor
18 publication provisions of subsection (8)(b) or the proposal notice fails to state the date on which and the manner

1 appropriate administrative rule review committee. If the secretary of state requires formatting changes to the
2 proposal notice before it may be published, the agency is not required to send another copy of the proposal
3 notice to the committee. The requirement to concurrently send a copy of the proposal notice to the committee is
4 fulfilled if the agency sends an electronic copy to each member of the staff of the appropriate rule review
5 committee on the same day that the notice is filed with the secretary of state.
6 (b) (i) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b)(ii), within 3 days of publication, a copy of the
7 published proposal notice must be sent to interested persons who have made timely requests to the agency to
8 be informed of its rulemaking proceedings, and to the office of any professional, trade, or industrial society or
9 organization or member of those entities who has filed a request with the appropriate administrative rule review
10 committee when the request has been forwarded to the agency as provided in subsection (2)(c).

14 agency's website or a description of the means of locating that part of the agency's website where the notice is
15 available.
16 (iii) Each agency shall create and maintain a list of interested persons and the subject or subjects
17 in which each person on the list is interested. A person who submits a written comment or attends a hearing in
18 regard to proposed agency action under this part must be informed of the list by the agency. An agency
19 complies with this subsection (2)(b)(iii) if it includes in the proposal notice an advisement explaining how
20 persons may be placed on the list of interested persons and if it complies with subsection (7).
21 (c) The appropriate administrative rule review committee shall forward a list of all organizations or
22 persons who have submitted a request to be informed of agency actions to the agencies that the committee
23 oversees that publish rulemaking notices in the register. The list must be amended by the agency upon request
24 of any person requesting to be added to or deleted from the list.
25 (d) The proposal notice required by subsection (1) must be published at least 30 days in advance
26 of the agency's proposed action. The agency shall post the proposal notice on a state digital access system or

18 (b) (i) Upon adoption of a rule, an agency shall issue a concise statement of the principal reasons
19 for and against its adoption, incorporating in the statement the reasons for overruling the considerations urged
20 against its adoption. If substantial differences exist between the rule as proposed and as adopted and the
21 differences have not been described or set forth in the adopted rule as that rule is published in the register, the
