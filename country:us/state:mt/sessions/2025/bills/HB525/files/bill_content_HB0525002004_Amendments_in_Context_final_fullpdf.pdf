3 (5) The distribution of tax-free cigarettes to a tribal member must be implemented through a
4 system of preapproved wholesaler shipments. A licensed Montana wholesaler shall contact the department for
5 approval prior to the shipment of the untaxed cigarettes. The department may authorize sales based on
6 whether the quota, as established in a cooperative agreement between the department and an Indian tribe or
7 as set out in this chapter, has been met. If authorized as a tax-exempt sale, the wholesaler, upon providing
8 proof of order and delivery to a retailer within the boundaries of a Montana Indian reservation selling cigarettes
9 to members of a federally recognized tribe or tribes of that reservation, must be given a refund or credit. Once
10 the quota has been filled, the department shall immediately notify all affected wholesalers that further sales on
11 that reservation must be taxed and that a claim for a refund or credit will not be honored for the remainder of
12 the quota period. Quota allocations are not transferable between quota periods or between reservations.
13 (6) The total amount of refunds or credits allowed by the department to all wholesalers claiming the
14 refund or credit under subsection (4) for any month may not exceed an amount that is equal to the tax due on

21 premium cigar. The tax on moist snuff is 85 cents an ounce based upon the net weight of the package listed by
22 the manufacturer. For packages of moist snuff that are less than or greater than 1 ounce, the tax must be
23 proportional to the size of the package. The tax on vapor products that contain nicotine is 20% of the wholesale
24 price. Tobacco products shipped from Montana and destined for retail sale and consumption outside the state
25 are not subject to this tax.
26 (8) The tax imposed by subsection (7) must be precollected and paid by a wholesaler to the
27 department upon sale to a Montana retailer. A wholesaler who fails to report or pay the tax required by this part
28 must be assessed penalty and interest as provided in 15-1-216.
