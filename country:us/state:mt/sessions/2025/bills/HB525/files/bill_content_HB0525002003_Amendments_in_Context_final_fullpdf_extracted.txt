17 provided in this section must be released and discharged from liability to the state accruing on the bond after
18 expiration of 60 days from the date on which the surety must have lodged with the attorney general a written

20 liability already accrued or that may accrue before the expiration of the 60-day period. The attorney general
21 shall, on receiving this request, notify the nonresident or foreign vapor product manufacturer who furnished the
22 bond. Unless the nonresident or foreign vapor product manufacturer, on or before the expiration of the 60-day
23 period, files with the attorney general a new bond with the surety approved by and acceptable to the attorney
24 general, the attorney general shall remove the nonresident or foreign vapor product manufacturer and the
