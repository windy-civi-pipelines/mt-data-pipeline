3 the building reserve lapses when, at a later time, a bond issue is approved by the qualified electors of the
4 district for the same purpose or purposes for which the building reserve fund of the district was established.
5 Whenever a subsequent bond issue is made for the same purpose or purposes of a building reserve, the

11 school fiscal year for the purposes of raising revenue for identified improvements or projects meeting the
12 requirements of 20-9-525(2). The 10-mill limit under this subsection (3) must be calculated using the district's
13 total taxable valuation most recently certified by the department of revenue under 15-10-202. The amount of
14 money raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and
15 anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) may not exceed the district's school major maintenance amount
16 as defined in 20-9-525. For the purposes of this section, the term "school major maintenance amount" means

22 deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to
23 20-9-525(3) will be used; and
24 (B) estimating a total dollar amount of money to be raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers
25 authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3), and the
26 resulting estimated number of mills to be levied using the district's taxable valuation most recently certified by
27 the department of revenue under 15-10-202; and
28 (ii) include the amount of any final levy to be imposed as part of its final budget meeting noticed in

1 compliance with 20-9-131.
2 (b) Proceeds from the levy may be expended only for the purposes under 20-9-525(2), and the
3 expenditure of the money must be reported in the annual trustees' report as required by 20-9-213.
4 (c) Whenever the trustees of a district impose a levy pursuant to this subsection (3) during the
5 current school fiscal year, they shall budget for the proceeds of the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized
6 under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) in the district's building
7 reserve fund budget. Any expenditures of the funds must be made in accordance with the financial
8 administration provisions of this title for a budgeted fund.

10 building reserve fund budget, the county superintendent shall report the levy requirement to the county
11 commissioners by the later of the first Tuesday in September or within 30 calendar days after receiving certified
12 taxable values and a levy on the district must be made by the county commissioners in accordance with 20-9-
13 142.
14 (e) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for the deposit of proceeds from the
15 levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid
16 pursuant to 20-9-525(3).
17 (f) If the imposition of 10 mills pursuant to subsection (3)(a) is estimated by the trustees to
18 generate an amount less than the maximum levy revenue specified in subsection (3)(a), the trustees may
19 deposit additional funds from any lawfully available revenue source and may transfer additional funds from any
20 lawfully available fund of the district to the subfund provided for in subsection (3)(a), up to the difference
21 between the revenue estimated to be raised by the imposition of 10 mills and the maximum levy revenue
22 specified in subsection (3)(a). The district's local effort for purposes of calculating its eligibility for state school
23 major maintenance aid pursuant to 20-9-525 consists of the combined total of funds raised from the imposition
24 of 10 mills and additional funds raised from deposits and transfers in compliance with this subsection (3)(f).
25 (4) (a) A voted levy may be imposed and a subfund must be created with the approval of the
26 qualified electors of the district to provide funding for transition costs incurred when the trustees:

14 purpose of calculating the limitation in 20-9-406.
