(b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b), a building reserve tax authorization may not be for
more than 20 years.
(c) The election must be conducted in accordance with the school election laws of this title, and
the electors qualified to vote in the election must be qualified under the provisions of 20-20-301. The ballot for a
building reserve proposition must be substantially in compliance with 15-10-425.
(d) The building reserve proposition is approved if a majority of those electors voting at the election
approve the establishment of or addition to the building reserve. The annual budgeting and taxation authority of
the trustees for a building reserve is computed by dividing the total authorized amount by the specified number
of years. The authority of the trustees to budget and impose the taxation for the annual amount to be raised for
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 515
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 515
the building reserve lapses when, at a later time, a bond issue is approved by the qualified electors of the
district for the same purpose or purposes for which the building reserve fund of the district was established.
Whenever a subsequent bond issue is made for the same purpose or purposes of a building reserve, the
money in the building reserve must be used for the purpose or purposes before any money realized by the
bond issue is used.
(3) (a) A subfund must be created to account for revenue and expenditures for school major
maintenance and repairs authorized under this subsection (3). The trustees of a district may authorize and
impose a levy of no more than 10 mills on the taxable value of all taxable property within the district for that
school fiscal year for the purposes of raising revenue for identified improvements or projects meeting the
requirements of 20-9-525(2). The 10-mill limit under this subsection (3) must be calculated using the district's
total taxable valuation most recently certified by the department of revenue under 15-10-202. The amount of
money raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and
anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) may not exceed the district's school major maintenance amount
as defined in 20-9-525. For the purposes of this section, the term "school major maintenance amount" means
the sum of $15,000 and the product of $110 multiplied by the district's budgeted ANB for the prior fiscal year.
To authorize and impose a levy under this subsection (3), the trustees shall:
(i) following public notice requirements pursuant to 20-9-116, adopt no later than March 31 of
each fiscal year a resolution:
(A) identifying the anticipated improvements or projects for which the proceeds of the levy, the
deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to
20-9-525(3) will be used; and
(B) estimating a total dollar amount of money to be raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers
authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3), and the
resulting estimated number of mills to be levied using the district's taxable valuation most recently certified by
the department of revenue under 15-10-202; and
(ii) include the amount of any final levy to be imposed as part of its final budget meeting noticed in
compliance with 20-9-131.
(b) Proceeds from the levy may be expended only for the purposes under 20-9-525(2), and the
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – HB 515
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 515
expenditure of the money must be reported in the annual trustees' report as required by 20-9-213.
(c) Whenever the trustees of a district impose a levy pursuant to this subsection (3) during the
current school fiscal year, they shall budget for the proceeds of the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized
under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) in the district's building
reserve fund budget. Any expenditures of the funds must be made in accordance with the financial
administration provisions of this title for a budgeted fund.
(d) When a tax levy pursuant to this subsection (3) is included as a revenue item on the final
building reserve fund budget, the county superintendent shall report the levy requirement to the county
commissioners by the later of the first Tuesday in September or within 30 calendar days after receiving certified
taxable values and a levy on the district must be made by the county commissioners in accordance with 20-9-

Section 11:
142.
(e) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for the deposit of proceeds from the
levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid
pursuant to 20-9-525(3).
(f) If the imposition of 10 mills pursuant to subsection (3)(a) is estimated by the trustees to
generate an amount less than the maximum levy revenue specified in subsection (3)(a), the trustees may
deposit additional funds from any lawfully available revenue source and may transfer additional funds from any
lawfully available fund of the district to the subfund provided for in subsection (3)(a), up to the difference
between the revenue estimated to be raised by the imposition of 10 mills and the maximum levy revenue
specified in subsection (3)(a). The district's local effort for purposes of calculating its eligibility for state school
major maintenance aid pursuant to 20-9-525 consists of the combined total of funds raised from the imposition
of 10 mills and additional funds raised from deposits and transfers in compliance with this subsection (3)(f).
(4) (a) A voted levy may be imposed and a subfund must be created with the approval of the
qualified electors of the district to provide funding for transition costs incurred when the trustees:
(i) open a new school under the provisions of Title 20, chapter 6;
(ii) close a school;
(iii) replace a school building;
(iv) consolidate with or annex another district under the provisions of Title 20, chapter 6; or
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – HB 515

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 515
(v) receive approval from voters to expand an elementary district into a K-12 district pursuant to
20-6-326.
(b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(c), the total amount the trustees may submit to the
electorate for transition costs may not exceed the number of years specified in the proposition times the greater
of 5% of the district's maximum general fund budget for the current year or $250 per ANB for the current year.
The duration of the levy for transition costs may not exceed 6 years.
(c) If the levy for transition costs is for consolidation or annexation:
(i) the limitation on the amount levied is calculated using the ANB and the maximum general fund
budget for the districts that are being combined; and
(ii) the proposition must be submitted to the qualified electors in the combined district.
(d) The levy for transition costs may not be considered as outstanding indebtedness for the
purpose of calculating the limitation in 20-9-406.
(5) (a) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for:
(i) the funds transferred to the building reserve fund for school safety and security pursuant to 20-
9-236; and
(ii) funds generated by a voter-approved levy for school and student safety and security pursuant
to subsection (5)(b) of this section.
(b) A voted levy may be imposed with the approval of the qualified electors of the district to provide
funding for improvements to school and student safety and security that meet any of the criteria set forth in 20-
9-236(1)(a) through (1)(e). A voted levy for school and student safety and security may not be considered as
outstanding indebtedness for the purpose of calculating the limitation in 20-9-406. The election for a voted levy
for school and student safety and security must be conducted in accordance with the school election laws of
this title, and the electors qualified to vote in the election must be qualified under the provisions of 20-20-301.
The ballot for a building reserve proposition must be substantially in compliance with 15-10-425."

(3) If in any fiscal year the amount of revenue in the school facility and technology account is
sufficient to fund debt service assistance without a proration reduction pursuant to 20-9-346(2)(b) and if in that
same fiscal year the amount of revenue available in the school major maintenance aid account established in
20-9-525 will result in a proration reduction in school major maintenance aid pursuant to 20-9-525(5) for that
fiscal year, the state treasurer shall transfer any excess funds in the school facility and technology account to
the school major maintenance aid account not to exceed the amount required to avoid a proration reduction."

Section 14:
section, aid must be annually distributed no later than the last working day of May to a school district imposing
a levy pursuant to 20-9-502(3) in the current school fiscal year, with the amount of state support per dollar of

amounts and, subject to adjustment under 20-9-336, multiply the result by 187% 355%;
(B) multiply the result determined under subsection (3) (a)(i)(A) (2)(a)(i)(A) by the district's school
major maintenance amount;
(C) subtract the district's taxable valuation from the amount determined under subsection

the ratio of the district's adopted general fund budget in the prior year to the district's maximum general fund
budget in the prior year. The result, rounded to the nearest cent, is the amount of state school major
maintenance aid per dollar of local effort, not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing
more than 80% of the district's school major maintenance amount.

major maintenance aid account in any school fiscal year are less than the amount of school major maintenance
aid for which school districts would otherwise qualify, the superintendent of public instruction shall proportionally
prorate the aid distributed to ensure that the distributions do not exceed the appropriated or available funds.
(6) If in any fiscal year the amount of revenue in the school major maintenance aid account is
sufficient to fund school major maintenance aid without a proration reduction pursuant to subsection (5) and if in
that same fiscal year the amount of revenue available in the school facility and technology account established

fiscal year, the state treasurer shall transfer any excess funds in the school major maintenance aid account to
the school facility and technology account, not to exceed the amount required to avoid a proration reduction.

(b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b), a building reserve tax authorization may not be for
more than 20 years.
(c) The election must be conducted in accordance with the school election laws of this title, and
the electors qualified to vote in the election must be qualified under the provisions of 20-20-301. The ballot for a
building reserve proposition must be substantially in compliance with 15-10-425.
(d) The building reserve proposition is approved if a majority of those electors voting at the election
approve the establishment of or addition to the building reserve. The annual budgeting and taxation authority of
the trustees for a building reserve is computed by dividing the total authorized amount by the specified number
of years. The authority of the trustees to budget and impose the taxation for the annual amount to be raised for
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – HB 515
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 515
the building reserve lapses when, at a later time, a bond issue is approved by the qualified electors of the
district for the same purpose or purposes for which the building reserve fund of the district was established.
Whenever a subsequent bond issue is made for the same purpose or purposes of a building reserve, the
money in the building reserve must be used for the purpose or purposes before any money realized by the
bond issue is used.
(3) (a) A subfund must be created to account for revenue and expenditures for school major
maintenance and repairs authorized under this subsection (3). The trustees of a district may authorize and
impose a levy of no more than 10 mills on the taxable value of all taxable property within the district for that
school fiscal year for the purposes of raising revenue for identified improvements or projects meeting the
requirements of 20-9-525(2). The 10-mill limit under this subsection (3) must be calculated using the district's
total taxable valuation most recently certified by the department of revenue under 15-10-202. The amount of
money raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and
anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) may not exceed the district's school major maintenance amount
as defined in 20-9-525. For the purposes of this section, the term "school major maintenance amount" means
the sum of $15,000 and the product of $110 multiplied by the district's budgeted ANB for the prior fiscal year.
To authorize and impose a levy under this subsection (3), the trustees shall:
(i) following public notice requirements pursuant to 20-9-116, adopt no later than March 31 of
each fiscal year a resolution:
(A) identifying the anticipated improvements or projects for which the proceeds of the levy, the
deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to
20-9-525(3) will be used; and
(B) estimating a total dollar amount of money to be raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers
authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3), and the
resulting estimated number of mills to be levied using the district's taxable valuation most recently certified by
the department of revenue under 15-10-202; and
(ii) include the amount of any final levy to be imposed as part of its final budget meeting noticed in
compliance with 20-9-131.
(b) Proceeds from the levy may be expended only for the purposes under 20-9-525(2), and the
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – HB 515
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 515
expenditure of the money must be reported in the annual trustees' report as required by 20-9-213.
(c) Whenever the trustees of a district impose a levy pursuant to this subsection (3) during the
current school fiscal year, they shall budget for the proceeds of the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized
under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) in the district's building
reserve fund budget. Any expenditures of the funds must be made in accordance with the financial
administration provisions of this title for a budgeted fund.
(d) When a tax levy pursuant to this subsection (3) is included as a revenue item on the final
building reserve fund budget, the county superintendent shall report the levy requirement to the county
commissioners by the later of the first Tuesday in September or within 30 calendar days after receiving certified
taxable values and a levy on the district must be made by the county commissioners in accordance with 20-9-
142.
(e) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for the deposit of proceeds from the
levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid
pursuant to 20-9-525(3).
(f) If the imposition of 10 mills pursuant to subsection (3)(a) is estimated by the trustees to
generate an amount less than the maximum levy revenue specified in subsection (3)(a), the trustees may
deposit additional funds from any lawfully available revenue source and may transfer additional funds from any
lawfully available fund of the district to the subfund provided for in subsection (3)(a), up to the difference
between the revenue estimated to be raised by the imposition of 10 mills and the maximum levy revenue
specified in subsection (3)(a). The district's local effort for purposes of calculating its eligibility for state school
major maintenance aid pursuant to 20-9-525 consists of the combined total of funds raised from the imposition
of 10 mills and additional funds raised from deposits and transfers in compliance with this subsection (3)(f).
(4) (a) A voted levy may be imposed and a subfund must be created with the approval of the
qualified electors of the district to provide funding for transition costs incurred when the trustees:
(i) open a new school under the provisions of Title 20, chapter 6;
(ii) close a school;
(iii) replace a school building;
(iv) consolidate with or annex another district under the provisions of Title 20, chapter 6; or

(v) receive approval from voters to expand an elementary district into a K-12 district pursuant to
20-6-326.
(b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(c), the total amount the trustees may submit to the
electorate for transition costs may not exceed the number of years specified in the proposition times the greater
of 5% of the district's maximum general fund budget for the current year or $250 per ANB for the current year.
The duration of the levy for transition costs may not exceed 6 years.
(c) If the levy for transition costs is for consolidation or annexation:
(i) the limitation on the amount levied is calculated using the ANB and the maximum general fund
budget for the districts that are being combined; and
(ii) the proposition must be submitted to the qualified electors in the combined district.
(d) The levy for transition costs may not be considered as outstanding indebtedness for the
purpose of calculating the limitation in 20-9-406.
(5) (a) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for:
(i) the funds transferred to the building reserve fund for school safety and security pursuant to 20-
9-236; and
(ii) funds generated by a voter-approved levy for school and student safety and security pursuant
to subsection (5)(b) of this section.
(b) A voted levy may be imposed with the approval of the qualified electors of the district to provide
funding for improvements to school and student safety and security that meet any of the criteria set forth in 20-
9-236(1)(a) through (1)(e). A voted levy for school and student safety and security may not be considered as
outstanding indebtedness for the purpose of calculating the limitation in 20-9-406. The election for a voted levy
for school and student safety and security must be conducted in accordance with the school election laws of
this title, and the electors qualified to vote in the election must be qualified under the provisions of 20-20-301.
The ballot for a building reserve proposition must be substantially in compliance with 15-10-425."

20-9-525 will result in a proration reduction in school major maintenance aid pursuant to 20-9-525(5) for that
fiscal year, the state treasurer shall transfer any excess funds in the school facility and technology account to
the school major maintenance aid account not to exceed the amount required to avoid a proration reduction."

section, aid must be annually distributed no later than the last working day of May to a school district imposing
a levy pursuant to 20-9-502(3) in the current school fiscal year, with the amount of state support per dollar of

(B) multiply the result determined under subsection (3) (a)(i)(A) (2)(a)(i)(A) by the district's school
major maintenance amount;
(C) subtract the district's taxable valuation from the amount determined under subsection

the ratio of the district's adopted general fund budget in the prior year to the district's maximum general fund
budget in the prior year. The result, rounded to the nearest cent, is the amount of state school major
maintenance aid per dollar of local effort, not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing
more than 80% of the district's school major maintenance amount.

major maintenance aid account in any school fiscal year are less than the amount of school major maintenance
aid for which school districts would otherwise qualify, the superintendent of public instruction shall proportionally
prorate the aid distributed to ensure that the distributions do not exceed the appropriated or available funds.
(6) If in any fiscal year the amount of revenue in the school major maintenance aid account is
sufficient to fund school major maintenance aid without a proration reduction pursuant to subsection (5) and if in
that same fiscal year the amount of revenue available in the school facility and technology account established

fiscal year, the state treasurer shall transfer any excess funds in the school major maintenance aid account to
the school facility and technology account, not to exceed the amount required to avoid a proration reduction.
