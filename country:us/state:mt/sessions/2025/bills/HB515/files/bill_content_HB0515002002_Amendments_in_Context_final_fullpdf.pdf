3 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b), a building reserve tax authorization may not be for
4 more than 20 years.
5 (c) The election must be conducted in accordance with the school election laws of this title, and
6 the electors qualified to vote in the election must be qualified under the provisions of 20-20-301. The ballot for a
7 building reserve proposition must be substantially in compliance with 15-10-425.
8 (d) The building reserve proposition is approved if a majority of those electors voting at the election
9 approve the establishment of or addition to the building reserve. The annual budgeting and taxation authority of
10 the trustees for a building reserve is computed by dividing the total authorized amount by the specified number
11 of years. The authority of the trustees to budget and impose the taxation for the annual amount to be raised for
12 the building reserve lapses when, at a later time, a bond issue is approved by the qualified electors of the
13 district for the same purpose or purposes for which the building reserve fund of the district was established.

20 school fiscal year for the purposes of raising revenue for identified improvements or projects meeting the
21 requirements of 20-9-525(2). The 10-mill limit under this subsection (3) must be calculated using the district's
22 total taxable valuation most recently certified by the department of revenue under 15-10-202. The amount of
23 money raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and
24 anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) may not exceed the district's school major maintenance amount
