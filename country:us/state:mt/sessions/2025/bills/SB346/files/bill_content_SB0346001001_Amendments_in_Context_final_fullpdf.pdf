12 Section 1. Section 39-71-610, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "39-71-610. Termination of benefits by insurer -- department order to pay disputed benefits
14 prior to hearing or mediation -- limitation on order -- right of reimbursement. (1) If an insurer terminates
15 biweekly compensation benefits and the termination of compensation benefits is disputed by the claimant, the
16 department may, upon on written request, order an insurer to pay additional biweekly compensation benefits
17 prior to a hearing before the workers' compensation court or prior to mediation, but the biweekly compensation
18 benefits may not be ordered to be paid under this section for a period exceeding 49 days or for any period
19 subsequent to the date of the hearing or mediation. A party may appeal this order to the workers' compensation
20 court. A proceeding in the workers' compensation court brought pursuant to this section is a new proceeding
21 and is not subject to mediation. If after a hearing before the workers' compensation court it is held that the
22 insurer was not liable for the compensation payments ordered by the department, the insurer has the right to be
23 reimbursed for the payments by the claimant.
24 (2) Benefits may be ordered only on the claimant demonstrating, on a more probable than not
25 basis, that the claimant will prevail.
26 (3) This section does not apply to disputes regarding:
