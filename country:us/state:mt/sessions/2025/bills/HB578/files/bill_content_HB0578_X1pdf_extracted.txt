Section 1:

69th Legislature 2025 HB 578
CONSIDERATION AN OFFENDER'S FINANCIAL RESOURCES WHEN SENTENCING RESTITUTION;
ALLOWING INFORMATION OF PECUNIARY LOSS OR LOSS OF PROPERTY TO BE PROVIDED TO A
PROBATION OFFICER OUTSIDE THE ORDER OF THE COURT; MODIFYING WHEN A COURT MAY
GRANT A PETITION TO REVISE RESTITUTION; AND AMENDING SECTIONS 45-5-206, 45-5-503, 45-5-507,
45-5-627, 45-6-101, 46-18-101, 46-18-242, AND 46-18-246, MCA.”
WHEREAS, the majority opinion in State v. Lodahl, 2021 MT 156, deviated from the plain language of
House Bill 220, Chapter 272, from the 2003 legislative session. Section 4 of House Bill 220 amended section
46-18-242, MCA, by removing from consideration an offender's "financial resources and future ability to pay
restitution" from consideration in an investigation and proof of victim's loss; and
WHEREAS, if a victim loses property or incurs a pecuniary loss, Montana law requires courts to order
restitution in sections 46-18-101, 46-18-201, and 46-18-251, MCA; and
WHEREAS, the intent of the Legislature in the 2003 revisions to section 46-18-242, MCA, was to
ensure that the restitution amount be determined during the sentencing process without consideration of the
offender's ability to pay restitution; and
WHEREAS, in keeping with the 2003 revisions to section 46-18-242, MCA, the waiver and modification
of the restitution process found in section 46-18-246, MCA, was intended to be a postjudgment inquiry requiring
the offender to file a subsequent petition to the sentencing court; and
WHEREAS, the amendments to section 46-18-246, MCA, in this bill are intended to further provide
evidence of legislative intent.

implement the policy established by this section.
(2) The correctional and sentencing policy of the state of Montana is to:
(a) punish each offender commensurate with the nature and degree of harm caused by the offense
and to hold an offender accountable;
(b) protect the public, reduce crime, and increase the public sense of safety by incarcerating
violent offenders and serious repeat offenders;
(c) provide restitution, reparation, and restoration to the victim of the offense; and
(d) encourage and provide opportunities for the offender's self-improvement to provide
rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders back into the community.
(3) To achieve the policy outlined in subsection (2), the state of Montana adopts the following
principles:
(a) Sentencing and punishment must be certain, timely, consistent, and understandable.
(b) Sentences should be commensurate with the punishment imposed on other persons
committing the same offenses.
(c) Sentencing practices must be neutral with respect to the offender's race, gender, religion,

national origin, or social or economic status.
(d) Sentencing practices must permit judicial discretion to consider aggravating and mitigating
circumstances.
(e) Sentencing practices must include punishing violent and serious repeat felony offenders with
incarceration.
(f) Sentencing practices must provide alternatives to imprisonment for the punishment of those
nonviolent felony offenders who do not have serious criminal records.
(g) Sentencing and correctional practices must emphasize that the offender is responsible for
obeying the law and must hold the offender accountable for the offender's actions.
(h) Sentencing practices must emphasize restitution to the victim by the offender. A sentence must
require an offender who is financially able to do so to pay restitution, costs as provided in 46-18-232, costs of
assigned counsel, as provided in 46-8-113, and, if the offender is a sex offender, costs of any chemical
treatment.

on restorative justice principles."

Section 13:

"46-18-242. Investigation and report of victim's loss. (1) (a) Whenever the court believes that a
victim may have sustained a pecuniary loss or whenever the prosecuting attorney requests, the court shall
order the probation officer, restitution officer, or other designated person to include in the presentence
investigation and report if requested pursuant to 46-18-111:
(a)(i) a list of the offender's assets; and
(b)(ii) an affidavit that specifically describes the victim's pecuniary loss and the replacement value in
dollars of the loss, submitted by the victim.
(b) If the court does not order the probation officer, restitution officer, or other designated person to
include information about a victim's pecuniary loss or loss of property in a presentence investigation, nothing
precludes the victim from providing that information to the probation officer, restitution officer, or other
designated person making the presentence investigation and report.

(2) When a presentence report is not requested, the court shall accept evidence of the victim's loss
at the time of sentencing."

Section 14:
Section 8. Section 46-18-246, MCA, is amended to read:
"46-18-246. Waiver or modification of payment. (1) Except as limited by subsection (2), An an

ordered restitution or amount to be paid pursuant to 46-18-241(2)(a).
(2) A court may not waive or adjust a restitution order within 1 year of imposition of the order or
during any period while an offender is in the custody of the department of corrections.
(3) The court shall schedule a hearing and give a victim to whom restitution was ordered notice of
the hearing date, place, and time and inform the victim that the victim will have an opportunity to be heard.
(4) If the court finds that the circumstances upon on which it based the imposition of restitution,
amount of the victim's pecuniary loss, or method or time of payment no longer exist or that it otherwise would
be unjust to require payment as imposed, the court may adjust or waive unpaid restitution or the amount to be
paid pursuant to 46-18-241(2)(a) or modify the time or method of making restitution.
(5) The court may extend the restitution schedule."

CONSIDERATION AN OFFENDER'S FINANCIAL RESOURCES WHEN SENTENCING RESTITUTION;
ALLOWING INFORMATION OF PECUNIARY LOSS OR LOSS OF PROPERTY TO BE PROVIDED TO A
PROBATION OFFICER OUTSIDE THE ORDER OF THE COURT; MODIFYING WHEN A COURT MAY
GRANT A PETITION TO REVISE RESTITUTION; AND AMENDING SECTIONS 45-5-206, 45-5-503, 45-5-507,
45-5-627, 45-6-101, 46-18-101, 46-18-242, AND 46-18-246, MCA.”
WHEREAS, the majority opinion in State v. Lodahl, 2021 MT 156, deviated from the plain language of
House Bill 220, Chapter 272, from the 2003 legislative session. Section 4 of House Bill 220 amended section
46-18-242, MCA, by removing from consideration an offender's "financial resources and future ability to pay
restitution" from consideration in an investigation and proof of victim's loss; and
WHEREAS, if a victim loses property or incurs a pecuniary loss, Montana law requires courts to order
restitution in sections 46-18-101, 46-18-201, and 46-18-251, MCA; and
WHEREAS, the intent of the Legislature in the 2003 revisions to section 46-18-242, MCA, was to
ensure that the restitution amount be determined during the sentencing process without consideration of the
offender's ability to pay restitution; and
WHEREAS, in keeping with the 2003 revisions to section 46-18-242, MCA, the waiver and modification
of the restitution process found in section 46-18-246, MCA, was intended to be a postjudgment inquiry requiring
the offender to file a subsequent petition to the sentencing court; and
WHEREAS, the amendments to section 46-18-246, MCA, in this bill are intended to further provide
evidence of legislative intent.

(a) punish each offender commensurate with the nature and degree of harm caused by the offense
and to hold an offender accountable;
(b) protect the public, reduce crime, and increase the public sense of safety by incarcerating
violent offenders and serious repeat offenders;
(c) provide restitution, reparation, and restoration to the victim of the offense; and

(b) Sentences should be commensurate with the punishment imposed on other persons
committing the same offenses.
(c) Sentencing practices must be neutral with respect to the offender's race, gender, religion,

obeying the law and must hold the offender accountable for the offender's actions.
(h) Sentencing practices must emphasize restitution to the victim by the offender. A sentence must
require an offender who is financially able to do so to pay restitution, costs as provided in 46-18-232, costs of
assigned counsel, as provided in 46-8-113, and, if the offender is a sex offender, costs of any chemical
treatment.

on restorative justice principles."

order the probation officer, restitution officer, or other designated person to include in the presentence
investigation and report if requested pursuant to 46-18-111:
(a)(i) a list of the offender's assets; and
(b)(ii) an affidavit that specifically describes the victim's pecuniary loss and the replacement value in
dollars of the loss, submitted by the victim.
(b) If the court does not order the probation officer, restitution officer, or other designated person to
include information about a victim's pecuniary loss or loss of property in a presentence investigation, nothing
precludes the victim from providing that information to the probation officer, restitution officer, or other
designated person making the presentence investigation and report.

(2) When a presentence report is not requested, the court shall accept evidence of the victim's loss

be unjust to require payment as imposed, the court may adjust or waive unpaid restitution or the amount to be
paid pursuant to 46-18-241(2)(a) or modify the time or method of making restitution.
