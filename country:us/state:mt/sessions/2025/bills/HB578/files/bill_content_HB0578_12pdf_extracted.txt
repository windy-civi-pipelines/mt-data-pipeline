69th Legislature 2025 HB 578.1
2 INTRODUCED BY B. MERCER
3
4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT GENERALLY REVISING LAWS RELATED TO RESTITUTION;
5 REMOVING FROM CONSIDERATION AN OFFENDER'S FINANCIAL RESOURCES WHEN SENTENCING
6 RESTITUTION; ALLOWING INFORMATION OF PECUNIARY LOSS OR LOSS OF PROPERTY TO BE
7 PROVIDED TO A PROBATION OFFICER OUTSIDE THE ORDER OF THE COURT; MODIFYING WHEN A
8 COURT MAY GRANT A PETITION TO REVISE RESTITUTION; AND AMENDING SECTIONS 45-5-206, 45-5-
9 503, 45-5-507, 45-5-627, 45-6-101, 46-18-101, 46-18-242, AND 46-18-246, MCA.”
10
11 WHEREAS, the majority opinion in State v. Lodahl, 2021 MT 156, deviated from the plain language of
12 House Bill 220, Chapter 272, from the 2003 legislative session. Section 4 of House Bill 220 amended section
13 46-18-242, MCA, by removing from consideration an offender's "financial resources and future ability to pay
14 restitution" from consideration in an investigation and proof of victim's loss; and
15 WHEREAS, if a victim loses property or incurs a pecuniary loss, Montana law requires courts to order
16 restitution in sections 46-18-101, 46-18-201, and 46-18-251, MCA; and
17 WHEREAS, the intent of the Legislature in the 2003 revisions to section 46-18-242, MCA, was to
18 ensure that the restitution amount be determined during the sentencing process without consideration of the
19 offender's ability to pay restitution; and
20 WHEREAS, in keeping with the 2003 revisions to section 46-18-242, MCA, the waiver and modification
21 of the restitution process found in section 46-18-246, MCA, was intended to be a postjudgment inquiry requiring
22 the offender to file a subsequent petition to the sentencing court; and
23 WHEREAS, the amendments to section 46-18-246, MCA, in this bill are intended to further provide
24 evidence of legislative intent.

15 (a) punish each offender commensurate with the nature and degree of harm caused by the offense
16 and to hold an offender accountable;
17 (b) protect the public, reduce crime, and increase the public sense of safety by incarcerating

26 committing the same offenses.

4 incarceration.
5 (f) Sentencing practices must provide alternatives to imprisonment for the punishment of those
6 nonviolent felony offenders who do not have serious criminal records.
7 (g) Sentencing and correctional practices must emphasize that the offender is responsible for
8 obeying the law and must hold the offender accountable for the offender's actions.
9 (h) Sentencing practices must emphasize restitution to the victim by the offender. A sentence must
10 require an offender who is financially able to do so to pay restitution, costs as provided in 46-18-232, costs of
11 assigned counsel, as provided in 46-8-113, and, if the offender is a sex offender, costs of any chemical

69th Legislature 2025 HB 578.1
1 HOUSE BILL NO. 578
2 INTRODUCED BY B. MERCER
3
4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT GENERALLY REVISING LAWS RELATED TO RESTITUTION;
5 REMOVING FROM CONSIDERATION AN OFFENDER'S FINANCIAL RESOURCES WHEN SENTENCING
6 RESTITUTION; ALLOWING INFORMATION OF PECUNIARY LOSS OR LOSS OF PROPERTY TO BE
7 PROVIDED TO A PROBATION OFFICER OUTSIDE THE ORDER OF THE COURT; MODIFYING WHEN A
8 COURT MAY GRANT A PETITION TO REVISE RESTITUTION; AND AMENDING SECTIONS 45-5-206, 45-5-
9 503, 45-5-507, 45-5-627, 45-6-101, 46-18-101, 46-18-242, AND 46-18-246, MCA.”
10
11 WHEREAS, the majority opinion in State v. Lodahl, 2021 MT 156, deviated from the plain language of
12 House Bill 220, Chapter 272, from the 2003 legislative session. Section 4 of House Bill 220 amended section
13 46-18-242, MCA, by removing from consideration an offender's "financial resources and future ability to pay
14 restitution" from consideration in an investigation and proof of victim's loss; and
15 WHEREAS, if a victim loses property or incurs a pecuniary loss, Montana law requires courts to order
16 restitution in sections 46-18-101, 46-18-201, and 46-18-251, MCA; and
17 WHEREAS, the intent of the Legislature in the 2003 revisions to section 46-18-242, MCA, was to
18 ensure that the restitution amount be determined during the sentencing process without consideration of the
19 offender's ability to pay restitution; and
20 WHEREAS, in keeping with the 2003 revisions to section 46-18-242, MCA, the waiver and modification
21 of the restitution process found in section 46-18-246, MCA, was intended to be a postjudgment inquiry requiring
22 the offender to file a subsequent petition to the sentencing court; and
23 WHEREAS, the amendments to section 46-18-246, MCA, in this bill are intended to further provide
24 evidence of legislative intent.

8 obeying the law and must hold the offender accountable for the offender's actions.

10 require an offender who is financially able to do so to pay restitution, costs as provided in 46-18-232, costs of
11 assigned counsel, as provided in 46-8-113, and, if the offender is a sex offender, costs of any chemical
12 treatment.

17 "46-18-242. Investigation and report of victim's loss. (1) (a) Whenever the court believes that a
18 victim may have sustained a pecuniary loss or whenever the prosecuting attorney requests, the court shall
19 order the probation officer, restitution officer, or other designated person to include in the presentence
20 investigation and report if requested pursuant to 46-18-111:
21 (a)(i) a list of the offender's assets; and
22 (b)(ii) an affidavit that specifically describes the victim's pecuniary loss and the replacement value in
23 dollars of the loss, submitted by the victim.
24 (b) If the court does not order the probation officer, restitution officer, or other designated person to
25 include information about a victim's pecuniary loss or loss of property in a presentence investigation, nothing
26 precludes the victim from providing that information to the probation officer, restitution officer, or other
27 designated person making the presentence investigation and report.
28 (2) When a presentence report is not requested, the court shall accept evidence of the victim's loss

3 Section 8. Section 46-18-246, MCA, is amended to read:
4 "46-18-246. Waiver or modification of payment. (1) Except as limited by subsection (2), An an

7 (2) A court may not waive or adjust a restitution order within 1 year of imposition of the order or
8 during any period while an offender is in the custody of the department of corrections.
9 (3) The court shall schedule a hearing and give a victim to whom restitution was ordered notice of
10 the hearing date, place, and time and inform the victim that the victim will have an opportunity to be heard.
11 (4) If the court finds that the circumstances upon on which it based the imposition of restitution,
12 amount of the victim's pecuniary loss, or method or time of payment no longer exist or that it otherwise would
13 be unjust to require payment as imposed, the court may adjust or waive unpaid restitution or the amount to be

15 (5) The court may extend the restitution schedule."
