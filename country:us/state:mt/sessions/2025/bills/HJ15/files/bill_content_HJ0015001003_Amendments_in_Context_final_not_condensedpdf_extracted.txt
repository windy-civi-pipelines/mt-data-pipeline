9 WHEREAS, electric transmission infrastructure must be updated to keep pace with modern
10 technological developments to better serve the energy needs of the state; and

14 enable greater investments to foster a diversified, resilient, and affordable electric grid; and
15 WHEREAS, updating Montana's electric transmission infrastructure is essential to unlocking the state's
16 energy development potential, ensuring electric grid reliability, and addressing current constrictions that hinder
17 energy imports, exports, and economic growth; and
18 WHEREAS, the United States Department of Energy has estimated that every dollar invested into
19 improving the electric transmission system will produce between $1.60 and $1.80 in cost savings to the system;

21 WHEREAS, electric transmission projects are particularly beneficial to Montanans when they prioritize
22 the use of skilled Montana-based labor; and
23 WHEREAS, transmission infrastructure not only unlocks tremendous economic benefits but also
24 creates direct tax revenues for local and state governments; and
25 WHEREAS, in addition to building new transmission lines, reconductoring existing transmission lines
26 with modern wiring and grid-enhancing technologies can produce system benefits at lower upfront costs.
