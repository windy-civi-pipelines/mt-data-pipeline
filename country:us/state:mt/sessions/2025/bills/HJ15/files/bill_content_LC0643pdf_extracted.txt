4 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
5 MONTANA SUPPORTING INCREASED TRANMISSION CAPACITY IN MONTANA.
6
7 WHEREAS, Over the last 100 years, Montana's electrical grid has developed and evolved, but
8 electrical transmission infrastructure development has been stagnant for decades; and
9 WHEREAS, electric transmission infrastructure must be updated to keep pace with modern
10 technological developments to better serve the energy needs of the state; and
11 WHEREAS, lack of access to lower-cost power in Montana has already resulted in the loss of large
12 industrial employers; and
13 WHEREAS, Montana's neighboring states have more robust transmission infrastructure and available
14 capacity than Montana; and
15 WHEREAS, increased electric transmission capacity within Montana and across state borders will
16 enable greater investments to foster a diversified, resilient, and affordable electric grid; and
17 WHEREAS, updating Montana's electric transmission infrastructure is essential to unlocking the state's
18 energy development potential, ensuring electric grid reliability, and addressing current constrictions that hinder
19 energy imports, exports, and economic growth; and
20 WHEREAS, the United States Department of Energy has estimated that every dollar invested into
21 improving the electric transmission system will produce between $1.60 and $1.80 in cost savings to the system;
22 and
23 WHEREAS, electric transmission projects are particularly beneficial to Montanans when they prioritize
24 the use of skilled Montana-based labor; and
25 WHEREAS, transmission infrastructure not only unlocks tremendous economic benefits but also
26 creates direct tax revenues for local and state governments; and
27 WHEREAS, in addition to building new transmission lines, reconductoring existing transmission lines
28 with modern wiring and grid-enhancing technologies can produce system benefits at lower upfront costs.
