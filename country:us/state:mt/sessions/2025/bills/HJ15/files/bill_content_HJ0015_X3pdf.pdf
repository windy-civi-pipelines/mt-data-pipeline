69th Legislature - 2025 HJ 15
A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
MONTANA SUPPORTING INCREASED TRANSMISSION CAPACITY IN MONTANA.
WHEREAS, Over the last 100 years, Montana's electrical grid has developed and evolved, but
additional electrical transmission infrastructure development is needed; and
WHEREAS, electric transmission infrastructure must be updated to keep pace with modern
technological developments to better serve the energy needs of the state; and
WHEREAS, lack of access to lower-cost power in Montana has already resulted in the loss of large
industrial employers; and
WHEREAS, increased electric transmission capacity within Montana and across state borders will
enable greater investments to foster a diversified, resilient, and affordable electric grid; and
WHEREAS, updating Montana's electric transmission infrastructure is essential to unlocking the state's
energy development potential, ensuring electric grid reliability, and addressing current constrictions that hinder
energy imports, exports, and economic growth; and
WHEREAS, the United States Department of Energy has estimated that every dollar invested into
improving the electric transmission system will produce between $1.60 and $1.80 in cost savings to the system;
and
WHEREAS, electric transmission projects are particularly beneficial to Montanans when they prioritize
the use of skilled Montana-based labor; and
WHEREAS, transmission infrastructure not only unlocks tremendous economic benefits but also
creates direct tax revenues for local and state governments; and
WHEREAS, in addition to building new transmission lines, reconductoring existing transmission lines
with modern wiring and grid-enhancing technologies can produce system benefits at lower upfront costs.
