69th Legislature - 2025 SJ 16
MONTANA URGING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF AUTOMATED
VEHICLES.
WHEREAS, automated driving system-equipped vehicles, sometimes called "partially autonomous
vehicles", are an increasingly prevalent aspect of vehicular traffic; and
WHEREAS, automated driving system-dedicated vehicles, sometimes called "fully autonomous
vehicles", may soon be on roadways in significant numbers; and
WHEREAS, widespread use of automation may significantly reduce traffic accidents in the future, but
the transition to increased automation poses challenges, and road and weather conditions in Montana pose
special challenges; and
WHEREAS, Montana has the highest rate of live animal-related fatal car crashes in the United States
due to the abundance of both wildlife and livestock on roadways, which poses a unique challenge for
automated vehicles; and
WHEREAS, the federal government is in the best position to regulate safety standards for vehicle
automation due to the interstate commerce clause of the United States Constitution.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the Montana Legislature urges the United States Congress and the federal Department of
Transportation to adopt laws and rules that ensure automated vehicles are capable of operating safely in all
weather conditions, including conditions that cover the roadway in snow or ice, and are capable of operating
safely in all road conditions, including mountain passes and roads through the open range.
