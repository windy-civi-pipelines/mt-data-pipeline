69th Legislature 2025 HB 339.1
1 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
2 the first Monday in February of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if those dates do not fall on a
3 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
4 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
5 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
6 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-
7 related days may be included in the calculation.
8 (3) When a school district has approval to operate less than the minimum aggregate hours under
9 20-9-806, the total ANB must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of 20-9-805.
10 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), for the purpose of calculating ANB, enrollment in
11 an education program:
12 (i) from 180 to 359 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as one-quarter-

25 providing fewer than the required aggregate hours of pupil instruction required under subsection (4)(a) or (4)(b)
26 if the pupil has demonstrated proficiency in the content ordinarily covered by the instruction as determined by
27 the school board using district assessments. The ANB of a pupil under this subsection (4)(d) must be converted
28 to an hourly equivalent based on the hours of instruction ordinarily provided for the content over which the

24 and the district must receive a basic entitlement for the school calculated separately from the other schools of
