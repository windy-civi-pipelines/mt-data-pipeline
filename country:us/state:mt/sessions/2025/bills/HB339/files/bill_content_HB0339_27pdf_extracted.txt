8 Section 2. Section 20-9-311, MCA, is amended to read:
9 "20-9-311. Calculation of average number belonging (ANB) -- 3-year averaging. (1) Average
10 number belonging (ANB) must be computed for each budget unit as follows:
11 (a) compute an average enrollment by adding a count of regularly enrolled pupils who were
12 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
13 the first Monday in February of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if those dates do not fall on a
14 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
15 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
16 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
17 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-
18 related days may be included in the calculation.
19 (3) When a school district has approval to operate less than the minimum aggregate hours under
20 20-9-806, the total ANB must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of 20-9-805.
21 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), for the purpose of calculating ANB, enrollment in
22 an education program:
23 (i) from 180 to 359 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as one-quarter-

7 (d) A school district may include in its calculation of ANB a pupil who is enrolled in a program
8 providing fewer than the required aggregate hours of pupil instruction required under subsection (4)(a) or (4)(b)
9 if the pupil has demonstrated proficiency in the content ordinarily covered by the instruction as determined by
10 the school board using district assessments. The ANB of a pupil under this subsection (4)(d) must be converted
11 to an hourly equivalent based on the hours of instruction ordinarily provided for the content over which the

18 counted as up to 1 1/4 enrollment for ANB purposes. A district shall add one-quarter enrollment for a pupil who
19 participated in an early literacy jumpstart program to the pupil's regular enrollment count under this subsection
20 (4) in both the October and February enrollment counts following the student's participation in the jumpstart
21 program.
22 (5) For a district that is transitioning from a half-time to a full-time kindergarten program, the state
23 superintendent shall count kindergarten enrollment in the previous year as full-time enrollment for the purpose
24 of calculating ANB for the elementary programs offering full-time kindergarten in the current year. For the
25 purposes of calculating the 3-year ANB, the superintendent of public instruction shall count the kindergarten
26 enrollment as one-half enrollment and then add the additional kindergarten ANB to the 3-year average ANB for
