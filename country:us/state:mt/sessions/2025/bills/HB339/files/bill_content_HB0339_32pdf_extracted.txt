9 Section 2. Section 20-9-311, MCA, is amended to read:
10 "20-9-311. Calculation of average number belonging (ANB) -- 3-year averaging. (1) Average
11 number belonging (ANB) must be computed for each budget unit as follows:
12 (a) compute an average enrollment by adding a count of regularly enrolled pupils who were
13 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
14 the first Monday in February of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if those dates do not fall on a
15 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
16 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
17 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
18 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-
19 related days may be included in the calculation.
20 (3) When a school district has approval to operate less than the minimum aggregate hours under
21 20-9-806, the total ANB must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of 20-9-805.
22 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), for the purpose of calculating ANB, enrollment in
23 an education program:
24 (i) from 180 to 359 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as one-quarter-
25 time enrollment;
26 (ii) from 360 to 539 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as half-time
27 enrollment;
28 (iii) from 540 to 719 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as three-

69th Legislature 2025 HB0339.3
1 quarter-time enrollment; and
2 (iv) 720 or more aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as full-time
3 enrollment.
4 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), enrollment in a program intended to provide fewer than
5 180 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year may not be included for purposes of ANB.
6 (c) Enrollment in a self-paced program or course may be converted to an hourly equivalent based
7 on the hours necessary and appropriate to provide the course within a regular classroom schedule.
8 (d) A school district may include in its calculation of ANB a pupil who is enrolled in a program
9 providing fewer than the required aggregate hours of pupil instruction required under subsection (4)(a) or (4)(b)
10 if the pupil has demonstrated proficiency in the content ordinarily covered by the instruction as determined by
11 the school board using district assessments. The ANB of a pupil under this subsection (4)(d) must be converted
12 to an hourly equivalent based on the hours of instruction ordinarily provided for the content over which the
13 student has demonstrated proficiency.
14 (e) (i) Except as provided in subsection (4)(e)(ii), a pupil in kindergarten through grade 12 who is
15 concurrently enrolled in more than one public school, program, or district may not be counted as more than one
16 full-time pupil for ANB purposes. When a pupil is concurrently enrolled in more than one district, any fractional
17 enrollment under subsection (4)(a) must be attributed first to a pupil's nonresident district.
18 (ii) A pupil who participates in a jumpstart program under Title 20, chapter 7, part 18, may be
19 counted as up to 1 1/4 enrollment for ANB purposes. A district shall add one-quarter enrollment for a pupil who
20 participated in an early literacy jumpstart program to the pupil's regular enrollment count under this subsection
21 (4) in both the October and February enrollment counts following the student's participation in the jumpstart
22 program.
23 (5) For a district that is transitioning from a half-time to a full-time kindergarten program, the state
24 superintendent shall count kindergarten enrollment in the previous year as full-time enrollment for the purpose
25 of calculating ANB for the elementary programs offering full-time kindergarten in the current year. For the
26 purposes of calculating the 3-year ANB, the superintendent of public instruction shall count the kindergarten
27 enrollment as one-half enrollment and then add the additional kindergarten ANB to the 3-year average ANB for
28 districts offering full-time kindergarten.

18 encouraged to collaborate with agencies and programs that serve adults with developmental disabilities in
19 meeting the goals of a student's transition plan.

21 district must be based on the aggregate of all the regularly enrolled pupils attending the schools of the district,
22 except that:
23 (a) the ANB is calculated as a separate budget unit when:
24 (i) a school of the district is located more than 20 miles beyond the incorporated limits of a city or
25 town located in the district and at least 20 miles from any other school of the district, the number of regularly

6 travel, that would result in an unusual hardship to the pupils of the school if they were transported to another
7 school, the number of regularly enrolled pupils of the school must be calculated separately for ANB purposes

26 enrolled pupils attending the nonaccredited school are not eligible for average number belonging calculation
27 purposes, nor will an average number belonging for the nonaccredited school be used in determining the BASE

9 providing fewer than the required aggregate hours of pupil instruction required under subsection (4)(a) or (4)(b)
10 if the pupil has demonstrated proficiency in the content ordinarily covered by the instruction as determined by

27 enrollment as one-half enrollment and then add the additional kindergarten ANB to the 3-year average ANB for
28 districts offering full-time kindergarten.
