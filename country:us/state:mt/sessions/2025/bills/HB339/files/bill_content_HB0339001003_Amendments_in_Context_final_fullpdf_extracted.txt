7 "20-9-311. Calculation of average number belonging (ANB) -- 3-year averaging. (1) Average
8 number belonging (ANB) must be computed for each budget unit as follows:
9 (a) compute an average enrollment by adding a count of regularly enrolled pupils who were
10 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
11 the first Monday in February of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if those dates do not fall on a
12 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
13 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
14 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
15 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-
16 related days may be included in the calculation.
17 (3) When a school district has approval to operate less than the minimum aggregate hours under
18 20-9-806, the total ANB must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of 20-9-805.
19 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), for the purpose of calculating ANB, enrollment in

2 180 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year may not be included for purposes of ANB.
3 (c) Enrollment in a self-paced program or course may be converted to an hourly equivalent based
4 on the hours necessary and appropriate to provide the course within a regular classroom schedule.
5 (d) A school district may include in its calculation of ANB a pupil who is enrolled in a program
6 providing fewer than the required aggregate hours of pupil instruction required under subsection (4)(a) or (4)(b)
7 if the pupil has demonstrated proficiency in the content ordinarily covered by the instruction as determined by
8 the school board using district assessments. The ANB of a pupil under this subsection (4)(d) must be converted
9 to an hourly equivalent based on the hours of instruction ordinarily provided for the content over which the
10 student has demonstrated proficiency.

12 concurrently enrolled in more than one public school, program, or district may not be counted as more than one

14 enrollment under subsection (4)(a) must be attributed first to a pupil's nonresident district.
15 (ii) A pupil who participates in a jumpstart program under Title 20, chapter 7, part 18, may be
16 counted as up to 1 1/4 enrollment for ANB purposes. A district shall add one-quarter enrollment for a pupil who
17 participated in an early literacy jumpstart program to the pupil's regular enrollment count under this subsection
18 (4) in both the October and February enrollment counts following the student's participation in the jumpstart
19 program.
20 (5) For a district that is transitioning from a half-time to a full-time kindergarten program, the state
21 superintendent shall count kindergarten enrollment in the previous year as full-time enrollment for the purpose
22 of calculating ANB for the elementary programs offering full-time kindergarten in the current year. For the
23 purposes of calculating the 3-year ANB, the superintendent of public instruction shall count the kindergarten
24 enrollment as one-half enrollment and then add the additional kindergarten ANB to the 3-year average ANB for
25 districts offering full-time kindergarten.
26 (6) When a pupil has been absent, with or without excuse, for more than 10 consecutive school
27 days, the pupil may not be included in the enrollment count used in the calculation of the ANB unless the pupil
28 resumes attendance prior to the day of the enrollment count.

7 "20-9-311. Calculation of average number belonging (ANB) -- 3-year averaging. (1) Average
8 number belonging (ANB) must be computed for each budget unit as follows:
9 (a) compute an average enrollment by adding a count of regularly enrolled pupils who were
10 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
11 the first Monday in February of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if those dates do not fall on a
12 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
13 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
14 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
15 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-
16 related days may be included in the calculation.
17 (3) When a school district has approval to operate less than the minimum aggregate hours under
18 20-9-806, the total ANB must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of 20-9-805.
19 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), for the purpose of calculating ANB, enrollment in
20 an education program:
21 (i) from 180 to 359 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as one-quarter-
22 time enrollment;
23 (ii) from 360 to 539 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as half-time
24 enrollment;
25 (iii) from 540 to 719 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as three-
26 quarter-time enrollment; and
27 (iv) 720 or more aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as full-time

1 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), enrollment in a program intended to provide fewer than
2 180 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year may not be included for purposes of ANB.
3 (c) Enrollment in a self-paced program or course may be converted to an hourly equivalent based
4 on the hours necessary and appropriate to provide the course within a regular classroom schedule.
5 (d) A school district may include in its calculation of ANB a pupil who is enrolled in a program
6 providing fewer than the required aggregate hours of pupil instruction required under subsection (4)(a) or (4)(b)
7 if the pupil has demonstrated proficiency in the content ordinarily covered by the instruction as determined by
8 the school board using district assessments. The ANB of a pupil under this subsection (4)(d) must be converted
9 to an hourly equivalent based on the hours of instruction ordinarily provided for the content over which the
10 student has demonstrated proficiency.
11 (e) (i) Except as provided in subsection (4)(e)(ii), a pupil in kindergarten through grade 12 who is
12 concurrently enrolled in more than one public school, program, or district may not be counted as more than one
13 full-time pupil for ANB purposes. When a pupil is concurrently enrolled in more than one district, any fractional
14 enrollment under subsection (4)(a) must be attributed first to a pupil's nonresident district.
15 (ii) A pupil who participates in a jumpstart program under Title 20, chapter 7, part 18, may be
16 counted as up to 1 1/4 enrollment for ANB purposes. A district shall add one-quarter enrollment for a pupil who
17 participated in an early literacy jumpstart program to the pupil's regular enrollment count under this subsection
18 (4) in both the October and February enrollment counts following the student's participation in the jumpstart
19 program.
20 (5) For a district that is transitioning from a half-time to a full-time kindergarten program, the state
21 superintendent shall count kindergarten enrollment in the previous year as full-time enrollment for the purpose
22 of calculating ANB for the elementary programs offering full-time kindergarten in the current year. For the
23 purposes of calculating the 3-year ANB, the superintendent of public instruction shall count the kindergarten
24 enrollment as one-half enrollment and then add the additional kindergarten ANB to the 3-year average ANB for
25 districts offering full-time kindergarten.
26 (6) When a pupil has been absent, with or without excuse, for more than 10 consecutive school
27 days, the pupil may not be included in the enrollment count used in the calculation of the ANB unless the pupil
28 resumes attendance prior to the day of the enrollment count.

19 except that:
20 (a) the ANB is calculated as a separate budget unit when:
21 (i) a school of the district is located more than 20 miles beyond the incorporated limits of a city or

23 enrolled pupils attending the nonaccredited school are not eligible for average number belonging calculation
24 purposes, nor will an average number belonging for the nonaccredited school be used in determining the BASE
25 funding program for the district.
