69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Pad McCracken, HB0339.001.001
1 number belonging (ANB) must be computed for each budget unit as follows:
2 (a) compute an average enrollment by adding a count of regularly enrolled pupils who were
3 enrolled as of the first Monday in October of the prior school fiscal year to a count of regularly enrolled pupils on
4 the first Monday in February of the prior school fiscal year or the next school day if those dates do not fall on a
5 school day, and divide the sum by two; and
6 (b) multiply the average enrollment calculated in subsection (1)(a) by the sum of 180 and the
7 approved pupil-instruction-related days for the current school fiscal year and divide by 180.
8 (2) For the purpose of calculating ANB under subsection (1), up to 7 approved pupil-instruction-
9 related days may be included in the calculation.
10 (3) When a school district has approval to operate less than the minimum aggregate hours under
11 20-9-806, the total ANB must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of 20-9-805.
12 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(d), for the purpose of calculating ANB, enrollment in
13 an education program:
14 (i) from 180 to 359 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as one-quarter-
15 time enrollment;
16 (ii) from 360 to 539 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as half-time
17 enrollment;
18 (iii) from 540 to 719 aggregate hours of pupil instruction per school year is counted as three-

25 on the hours necessary and appropriate to provide the course within a regular classroom schedule.
26 (d) A school district may include in its calculation of ANB a pupil who is enrolled in a program
27 providing fewer than the required aggregate hours of pupil instruction required under subsection (4)(a) or (4)(b)
28 if the pupil has demonstrated proficiency in the content ordinarily covered by the instruction as determined by

5 concurrently enrolled in more than one public school, program, or district may not be counted as more than one

7 enrollment under subsection (4)(a) must be attributed first to a pupil's nonresident district.
8 (ii) A pupil who participates in a jumpstart program under Title 20, chapter 7, part 18, may be
9 counted as up to 1 1/4 enrollment for ANB purposes. A district shall add one-quarter enrollment for a pupil who
10 participated in an early literacy jumpstart program to the pupil's regular enrollment count under this subsection
11 (4) in both the October and February enrollment counts following the student's participation in the jumpstart
12 program.
13 (5) For a district that is transitioning from a half-time to a full-time kindergarten program, the state
14 superintendent shall count kindergarten enrollment in the previous year as full-time enrollment for the purpose
15 of calculating ANB for the elementary programs offering full-time kindergarten in the current year. For the
16 purposes of calculating the 3-year ANB, the superintendent of public instruction shall count the kindergarten
17 enrollment as one-half enrollment and then add the additional kindergarten ANB to the 3-year average ANB for
18 districts offering full-time kindergarten.
19 (6) When a pupil has been absent, with or without excuse, for more than 10 consecutive school
20 days, the pupil may not be included in the enrollment count used in the calculation of the ANB unless the pupil
21 resumes attendance prior to the day of the enrollment count.

21 calculated separately from the other schools of the district;
22 (iii) the superintendent of public instruction approves an application not to aggregate when
23 geographic barriers exist affecting transportation, such as poor roads, mountains, rivers, or other obstacles to
24 travel, that would result in an unusual hardship to the pupils of the school if they were transported to another
25 school, the number of regularly enrolled pupils of the school must be calculated separately for ANB purposes
26 and the district must receive a basic entitlement for the school calculated separately from the other schools of
