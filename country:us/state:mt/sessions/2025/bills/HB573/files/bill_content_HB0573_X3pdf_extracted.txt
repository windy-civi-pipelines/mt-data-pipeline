including first-time applications and annual reports requesting an expansion of a previously approved plan, are
to be deferred for consideration in a subsequent year, in the order of a lottery system draw, if and when
additional funds become available for distribution. The lottery system shall assign every first-time application or
request for expansion of a previously approved plan a number that will be placed into a lottery system draw that
will be done by a third party. The applications will be assigned a position in the order in which the numbers are
drawn. The drawing will continue until all districts are on the qualification list for the current year funding or
deferred for consideration in a subsequent year.

applications and annual reports requesting an expansion of a previously approved plan and must be contingent
on the availability of funds within any appropriation of the legislature. An application deferred for consideration
in a subsequent year due to lack of funding must be annually updated each year after more than 1 full fiscal

priority by original date received.

by districts as submitted in the annual report and strategic plan operating under approved and funded
transformational learning plans.

flexibility fund established under 20-9-543 by October 1 of each year of funding by the superintendent of public

transformational learning plan within 2 full school fiscal years after the funds are transferred must be transferred
back to the originating fund from which the revenue was transferred.

of school districts without an increase in local taxes. In furtherance of this intent, if transfers of funds are made
from any school district fund supported by a nonvoted levy, the district may not increase its nonvoted levy for
the purpose of restoring the amount of funds transferred.
