1 (4) A parent, guardian, or other person supervising the welfare of a child less than 16 years of age
2 may verbally or in writing request a person who is 18 years of age or older and who has no legal right of
3 supervision or control over the child to stop contacting the child if the requester believes that the contact is not
4 in the child's best interests. If the person continues to contact the child, the parent, guardian, or other person
5 supervising the welfare of the child may petition or the county attorney may upon the person's request petition
6 for an order of protection under Title 40, chapter 15. To the extent that they are consistent with this subsection,
7 the provisions of Title 40, chapter 15, apply. A person who purposely or knowingly violates an order of
8 protection commits the offense of endangering the welfare of children and upon conviction shall be sentenced
9 as provided in subsection (5)(a).
10 (5) (a) Except as provided in subsection (5)(b), a person convicted of endangering the welfare of
11 children shall be fined an amount not to exceed $500 or be imprisoned in the county jail for any term not to
12 exceed 6 months, or both. A person convicted of a second offense of endangering the welfare of children shall
13 be fined an amount not to exceed $1,000 or be imprisoned in the county jail for any term not to exceed 6
14 months, or both.
15 (b) A person convicted under subsection (3) is guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned in the
16 state prison for a term not to exceed 5 years and may be fined an amount not to exceed $10,000, or both. If a
17 child suffers serious bodily injury, the offender shall be fined an amount not to exceed $25,000 or be imprisoned
18 for a term not to exceed 10 years, or both. Prosecution or conviction of a violation of subsection (3) does not
19 bar prosecution or conviction for any other crime committed by the offender as part of the same conduct.
20 (6) On the issue of whether there has been a violation of the duty of care, protection, and support,
21 the following, in addition to all other admissible evidence, is admissible: cruel treatment; abuse; infliction of
22 unnecessary and cruel punishment; abandonment; neglect; lack of proper medical care, clothing, shelter, and
23 food; and evidence of past bodily injury.
24 (7) The court may order, in its discretion, any fine levied or any bond forfeited upon a charge of
25 endangering the welfare of children paid to or for the benefit of the person or persons whose welfare the
26 defendant has endangered."
