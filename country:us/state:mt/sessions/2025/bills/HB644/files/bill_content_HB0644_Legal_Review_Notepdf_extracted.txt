CONFORMITY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS
As required pursuant to section 5-11-112(1)(c), MCA, it is the Legislative Services Division's
statutory responsibility to conduct "legal review of draft bills". The comments noted below
regarding conformity with state and federal constitutions are provided to assist the Legislature
in making its own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill. The comments are based
on an analysis of jurisdictionally relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the
bill. The comments are not written for the purpose of influencing whether the bill should
become law but are written to provide information relevant to the Legislature's consideration
of this bill. The comments are not a formal legal opinion and are not a substitute for the
judgment of the judiciary, which has the authority to determine the constitutionality of a law
in the context of a specific case.
This review is intended to inform the bill draft requestor of potential constitutional conformity
issues that may be raised by the bill as drafted. This review IS NOT dispositive of the issue of
constitutional conformity and the general rule as repeatedly stated by the Montana Supreme
Court is that an enactment of the Legislature is presumed to be constitutional unless it is
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the enactment is unconstitutional. See Alexander v.
Bozeman Motors, Inc., 356 Mont. 439, 234 P.3d 880 (2010); Eklund v. Wheatland County,
351 Mont. 370, 212 P.3d 297 (2009); St. v. Pyette, 337 Mont. 265, 159 P.3d 232 (2007); and
Elliott v. Dept. of Revenue, 334 Mont. 195, 146 P.3d 741 (2006).
Legal Reviewer Comments:
HB 644 may raise potential constitutional concerns associated with Article VIII,

Section 2:
sections, of the Montana Constitution, which provides: “The state shall appraise, assess, and
equalize the valuation of all property which is to be taxed in the manner provided by law.” The
draft may also raise potential constitutional concerns associated with Article VIII, sections 4, of
the Montana Constitution, which provides: “All taxing jurisdictions shall use the assessed
valuation of property established by the state.”
In New Section 1 of HB 644, the state may delegate its authority to appraise property within a
county for property tax purposes as follows:

Section 3:
Section 1. County property appraiser. (1) With written permission from the
department of a revenue, a county may employ a property appraiser who appraises
property within the county for property tax purposes. The appraiser must be certified
pursuant to 15-7-107 and must use the appraisal methods provided for in Title 15, chapter
7, part 1.
(2) An appraiser employed by a county shall provide property appraisals to
the department of revenue by July 1. An appraisal provided to the department by a county
must be used when certifying taxable values pursuant to 15-10-202.
Article VIII, section 3, mandates that the state shall appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation
of all property. Additionally, Article VIII, section 4, mandates that valuation of property is
established by the state. These provisions do not provide the state with authority to delegate its
constitutional mandate to appraise property.
HB 644 contains a provision that allows the state to delegate its constitutional mandate to
appraise property within a county for property tax purposes. Therefore, HB 644 may raise
potential questions about whether this bill conforms with Article VIII, sections 3 and 4, of the
Montana Constitution.

Legal Reviewer Comments:
HB 644 may raise potential constitutional concerns associated with Article VIII,
sections, of the Montana Constitution, which provides: “The state shall appraise, assess, and
equalize the valuation of all property which is to be taxed in the manner provided by law.” The
draft may also raise potential constitutional concerns associated with Article VIII, sections 4, of

the Montana Constitution, which provides: “All taxing jurisdictions shall use the assessed
valuation of property established by the state.”
In New Section 1 of HB 644, the state may delegate its authority to appraise property within a
county for property tax purposes as follows:
Section 1. County property appraiser. (1) With written permission from the
department of a revenue, a county may employ a property appraiser who appraises
property within the county for property tax purposes. The appraiser must be certified
pursuant to 15-7-107 and must use the appraisal methods provided for in Title 15, chapter
7, part 1.
(2) An appraiser employed by a county shall provide property appraisals to
the department of revenue by July 1. An appraisal provided to the department by a county
must be used when certifying taxable values pursuant to 15-10-202.
Article VIII, section 3, mandates that the state shall appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation
of all property. Additionally, Article VIII, section 4, mandates that valuation of property is
established by the state. These provisions do not provide the state with authority to delegate its
constitutional mandate to appraise property.
HB 644 contains a provision that allows the state to delegate its constitutional mandate to
appraise property within a county for property tax purposes. Therefore, HB 644 may raise
potential questions about whether this bill conforms with Article VIII, sections 3 and 4, of the
Montana Constitution.
