6 the market concentration of the 50 largest insurers writing or actively engaged in workers' compensation

19 (iv) prohibit or limit by at least 50% the premium written by producer agencies to the monopoly
20 carrier until the market is of a reasonable competitive measure; and
21 (v) immediately implement regulations that actively promote competition and discourage practices
22 that contribute to market concentration.
23 (c) The list of corrective measures in subsection (4)(b) is not an exhaustive list of corrective
24 measures to improve market concentration. The commissioner may add other courses of action to the list.
25 (4) (5) The commissioner's determinations must be made on the basis of findings of fact and
26 conclusions of law. Upon the commissioner taking action as provided in subsection (4)(b), the commissioner
27 shall provide notice to all customers, insurers, and producers who participate in workers' compensation in the
