13 WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature created early literacy targeted intervention programs in 2023 and

17 WHEREAS, research indicates that children who engage in early numeracy activities demonstrate
18 improved problem-solving skills and mathematical fluency as they progress through their education; and
19 WHEREAS, it is crucial that efforts to improve early literacy and numeracy are coordinated between
20 parents and all of the entities with a role in establishing policy and guiding early literacy and numeracy
21 development; and
22 WHEREAS, despite these investments and advances, the critical importance of developing literacy and
23 numeracy in young children warrants legislative attention.
