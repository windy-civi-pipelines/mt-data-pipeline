Section 1:
69th Legislature HJ 47
MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITY COOPERATION AND
CONSOLIDATION; AND REQUESTING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO
THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, local government entities, including county, municipal, and consolidated governments, but
also a variety of special districts, including but not limited to fire districts, water and sewer districts, road
improvement districts, housing authority districts, hospital districts, weed management districts, airport authority
districts, irrigation districts, and other miscellaneous districts, are the government units that most closely and
directly serve the citizens of Montana; and
WHEREAS, in addition to the various districts, each county, municipality, and consolidated local
government is often organized into departments, each with a duty to serve the citizens of Montana and deliver
effective service; and
WHEREAS, a majority of local government entities and departments cooperate well and have taken
effective steps to meet the needs of their constituents; however, multiple cases exist that demonstrate a lack of
cooperation, unnecessary conflict, or otherwise inefficient and ineffective government; and
WHEREAS, the changing demographics of Montana also pose a unique challenge for some areas to
continue to provide effective service, especially government entities such as fire departments, fire districts, and
fire service areas and other emergency and disaster response entities who have experienced population growth
or other changes to the communities they serve; and
WHEREAS, reviewing the statutory framework for local government entities and determining if
additional tools are needed for those who are experiencing challenges will benefit all citizens of Montana who
deserve a functional, effective, and fiscally responsible government.

ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature HJ 47
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
committee, pursuant to section 5-5-217, MCA, or direct sufficient staff resources to:
(1) identify areas of local government that may benefit from more intergovernmental cooperation or
strategies to improve communication, cooperation, and mutual benefit;
(2) review current methods of intergovernmental cooperation available to local government entities
and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of current methods;
(3) examine methods or policies used in other states that have been demonstrated to aid in
intergovernmental cooperation and determine if the methods or policies may be appropriate for Montana;
(4) identify and analyze areas of local government that may benefit from consolidation, including
consideration of methods for withdrawal or dissolution if local government entities choose to consolidate; and
(5) analyze the fiscal impacts of increased cooperation or consolidation to both local government
entities and the state, including a review of current costs of operation and whether increased cooperation or
consolidation measures may reduce those costs.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the committee engage appropriate stakeholders, including but not
limited to local government officials and employees, the Montana Association of Counties, the Montana League
of Cities and Towns, and the Montana State University Local Government Center.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the committee make reasonable attempts to receive input from
individual members of local government entities being investigated and take comment from all parties involved
in the event the committee discovers a lack of communication, cooperation, or general government
effectiveness.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the study is assigned to staff, any findings or conclusions be
presented to and reviewed by an appropriate committee designated by the Legislative Council.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all aspects of the study, including presentation and review
requirements, be concluded prior to September 15, 2026.
