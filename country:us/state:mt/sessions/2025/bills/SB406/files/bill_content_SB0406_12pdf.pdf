1 SENATE BILL NO. 406
2 INTRODUCED BY C. POPE, C. NEUMANN, J. ELLIS, S. WEBBER, D. FERN, D. HAYMAN
3
4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT ESTABLISHING UTILITY ENERGY CONSERVATION
5 EFFICIENCY STANDARDS; PROVIDING UTILITY ACQUISITION AND PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS;
6 PROVIDING RULEMAKING AUTHORITY; PROVIDING A DEFINITION; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE
7 EFFECTIVE DATE.”
8
9 WHEREAS, affordable, reliable sources of electrical service are essential to the long-term health and
10 well-being of Montana citizens and their state economy; and
11 WHEREAS, periodic excessive peaks in electricity demand significantly burden the reliability of the grid
12 and increase the cost of delivered electricity service to consumers; and
13 WHEREAS, investments in utility-scale energy conservation have the potential to reduce costs and
14 improve the reliability of delivered electricity service to minimize costly structural peaks in electricity demand;
15 and
16 WHEREAS, Montana investor-owned utilities may be otherwise disincentivized to adopt utility-scale
17 energy conservation initiatives due to their traditional business goal of selling more electricity; and
18 WHEREAS, utility investments in energy conservation benefit all customers, program participants and
19 nonparticipants alike, by increasing grid stability and reliability, and by reducing the need for more costly
20 investments in new generation.
21 WHEREAS, utility investments in energy conservation are proven to enable cost-effective commercial
22 application of affordable, clean, and firm power generation by shaving peak periods of expensive, thermal-
23 generated power.
24 THEREFORE, a utility energy conservation efficiency standard is hereby enacted to ensure investor-
25 owned utilities in Montana pursue all opportunities of energy conservation when proven to be cost-effective to
26 ratepayers, and to adopt the use of energy conservation as a component of economic dispatch, capable of
27 reimbursing and rewarding shareholders of Montana investor-owned utilities for energy-efficiency investments
28 made on behalf of ratepayers when those investments are funded by ratepayers.

10 assessment to the commission.
11 (b) The energy conservation assessment must:
12 (i) be completed by an independent entity with experience in performing energy conservation
13 evaluations for utilities;
14 (ii) estimate the amount of all available and achievable cost-effective energy conservation on the
15 utility's system that could reasonably be acquired by all utility programs on or before December 31, 2027, and
16 account for the effect of any state or federal energy conservation acquisition programs; and
17 (iii) be updated every 2 years.
18 (3) The energy conservation assessment must be accompanied by a plan for acquiring all cost-
19 effective energy conservation identified by the assessment, including the establishment of annual energy
20 conservation targets. The annual energy conservation target may not be lower than 1% of retail load as
21 identified in [section 3].
22 (4) The plan must address the potential value to consumers and ratepayers of energy
23 conservation, to include:
24 (a) deferred investment in generation, transmission, or distribution of electricity;
25 (b) reduced need for additional generation of electricity during times of peak demand;
26 (c) improved integration of different types of renewable resources;
27 (d) reduced greenhouse gas emissions;
28 (e) improved reliability of electrical transmission or distribution systems;
