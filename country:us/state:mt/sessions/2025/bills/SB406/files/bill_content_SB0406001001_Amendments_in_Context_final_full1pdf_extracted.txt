4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT ESTABLISHING UTILITY ENERGY CONSERVATION
5 EFFICIENCY STANDARDS; PROVIDING UTILITY ACQUISITION AND PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS;
6 PROVIDING RULEMAKING AUTHORITY; PROVIDING A DEFINITION; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE
7 EFFECTIVE DATE.”

9 WHEREAS, affordable, reliable sources of electrical service are essential to the long-term health and
10 well-being of Montana citizens and their state economy; and
11 WHEREAS, periodic excessive peaks in electricity demand significantly burden the reliability of the grid
12 and increase the cost of delivered electricity service to consumers; and
13 WHEREAS, investments in utility-scale energy conservation have the potential to reduce costs and
14 improve the reliability of delivered electricity service to minimize costly structural peaks in electricity demand;
15 and
16 WHEREAS, Montana investor-owned utilities may be otherwise disincentivized to adopt utility-scale
17 energy conservation initiatives due to their traditional business goal of selling more electricity; and
18 WHEREAS, utility investments in energy conservation benefit all customers, program participants and
19 nonparticipants alike, by increasing grid stability and reliability, and by reducing the need for more costly
20 investments in new generation.
21 WHEREAS, utility investments in energy conservation are proven to enable cost-effective commercial
22 application of affordable, clean, and firm power generation by shaving peak periods of expensive, thermal-
23 generated power.
24 THEREFORE, a utility energy conservation efficiency standard is hereby enacted to ensure investor-
25 owned utilities in Montana pursue all opportunities of energy conservation when proven to be cost-effective to
26 ratepayers, and to adopt the use of energy conservation as a component of economic dispatch, capable of
27 reimbursing and rewarding shareholders of Montana investor-owned utilities for energy-efficiency investments
