8 WHEREAS, the United States has surpassed more than $36 trillion in national debt, which amounts to
9 over $166,000 in debt for each American; and
10 WHEREAS, the federal fiscal situation results in economic uncertainty and recurrent threats of
11 government shutdown; and
12 WHEREAS, government fiscal responsibility provides American citizens with the confidence to engage
13 in our state and national economies, which is beneficial to all; and
14 WHEREAS, now more than ever, having seen national inflation rates fluctuate dramatically over the
15 past 4 years, even as high as 8% in 2022, fiscal responsibility is necessary not only at the individual level but
16 also at the state and federal government levels; and
17 WHEREAS, the State of Montana has engaged in record spending year after year, most recently
18 evidenced by the Governor's proposed 2-year state budget of $17.9 billion; and

20 the prosperity of all of Montana's citizenry.

22 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
23 MONTANA:
24 That if a member of the Legislature of the State of Montana introduces a bill with an appropriation or
25 amends a bill to include an appropriation to authorize the expenditure of money, the bill must also identify a
26 program or programs from which the newly appropriated funds are to be reallocated to offset the new
27 expenditure.
