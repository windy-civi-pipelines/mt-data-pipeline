MONTANA REQUESTING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE THE HOURS OF SERVICE AT
MONTANA-CANADA CUSTOMS PORTS OF ENTRY.
WHEREAS, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency has reduced the hours of service at
several Montana-Canada customs ports of entry; and
WHEREAS, the hours of service reductions have impeded commerce and trade between Montana and
Canada as well as the free flow of cross-border travel for business, leisure, competitive sports, and the
maintenance of family ties; and
WHEREAS, Montana and Canada have a trading relationship that enhances the economic viability of
communities on both sides of the border, including $1.2 billion in goods and services exported from Montana to
Canada annually; and
WHEREAS, Canada is Montana's number one export market, and Montana sells more goods to
Canada than to its next 20 largest foreign markets combined; and
WHEREAS, Canada has been America's most trusted ally and its friendliest and largest trading partner,
with bilateral trade of $2.7 billion a day and over 300,000 people crossing the border each day.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF

That the 69th Montana Legislature, representing all citizens of Montana, requests the federal
