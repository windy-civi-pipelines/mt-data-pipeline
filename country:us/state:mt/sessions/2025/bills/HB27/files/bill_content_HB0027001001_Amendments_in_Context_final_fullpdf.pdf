26 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
27 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
28 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in

1 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
2 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
3 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
4 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
5 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
6 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
7 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
8 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
9 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
10 labor.
11 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any

20 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
21 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
22 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
23 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
24 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
25 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
26 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
27 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
28 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax

1 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
2 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
3 following tax year.
4 (c) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property
5 that was constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the
6 current year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
7 (d) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the
8 first sale of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as

13 (6) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds
14 taxes received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
15 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
16 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
17 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
18 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
19 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the
20 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
21 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
22 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
23 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.

25 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
