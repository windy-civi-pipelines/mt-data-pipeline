8 depreciation, functional obsolescence, or economic obsolescence.
9 (c) If the department uses the income approach as one approximation of market value and

11 the two methods that provide a similar market value as the better indicators of market value.
12 (d) Except as provided in subsection (4), the market value of special mobile equipment and

22 in the same neighborhood or subdivision unless there is a compelling reason to use a different approach.
23 (b) When valuing residential property under the cost approach, the department shall document
24 why the comparable sales model does not support usage of the comparable sales approach, including an

9 (c) (i) for condominium property, the department shall establish the value as provided in
10 subsection (5); and
11 (ii) for a townhome or townhouse, as defined in 70-23-102, the department shall determine the
12 value in a manner established by the department by rule; and
13 (d) as otherwise authorized in Titles 15 and 61.
14 (5) (a) Subject to subsection (5)(c), if sufficient, relevant information on comparable sales is
15 available, the department shall use the sales comparison approach to appraise residential condominium units.
16 Because the undivided interest in common elements is included in the sales price of the condominium units, the
17 department is not required to separately allocate the value of the common elements to the individual units being
18 valued.
19 (b) Subject to subsection (5)(c), if sufficient, relevant information on income is made available to
20 the department, the department shall use the income approach to appraise commercial condominium units.
21 Because the undivided interest in common elements contributes directly to the income-producing capability of
22 the individual units, the department is not required to separately allocate the value of the common elements to
23 the individual units being valued.
24 (c) If sufficient, relevant information on comparable sales is not available for residential
25 condominium units or if sufficient, relevant information on income is not made available for commercial
26 condominium units, the department shall value condominiums using the cost approach. When using the cost
27 approach, the department shall value the units individually and allocate only the common area elements to the
28 units based on the percentage of undivided interest in the condominium declaration.

3 Section 9. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
4 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
5 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
6 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
7 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
8 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
9 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
10 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
11 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
12 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
13 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
14 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
15 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
16 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
17 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
18 labor.
19 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
20 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
21 including newly taxable property.
22 (3) (a) For the purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
23 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
24 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
25 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
26 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
27 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
28 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – HB 27

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0027.2
1 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
2 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
3 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
4 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
5 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
6 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
7 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
8 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
9 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
10 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
11 following tax year.
12 (c) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property
13 that was constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the
14 current year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
15 (d) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the
16 first sale of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
17 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
18 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:
19 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or
20 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
21 (6) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds
22 taxes received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
23 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
24 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
25 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
26 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
27 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the
28 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 27

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0027.2
1 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
2 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
3 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
4 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
5 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
6 (ii) a levy to repay taxes paid under protest as provided in 15-1-402;
7 (iii) an emergency levy authorized under 10-3-405, 20-9-168, or 20-15-326;
8 (iv) a levy for the support of a study commission under 7-3-184;
9 (v) a levy for the support of a newly established regional resource authority;
10 (vi) the portion that is the amount in excess of the base contribution of a governmental entity's
11 property tax levy for contributions for group benefits excluded under 2-9-212 or 2-18-703;
12 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
13 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
14 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
15 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
16 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
17 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
18 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) may not be included in the amount of property taxes
19 actually assessed in a subsequent year.
20 (10) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
21 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
22 authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated
23 operating funds by a county or municipality during that time.
24 (11) The department may adopt rules to implement this section. The rules may include a method for
25 calculating the percentage of change in valuation for the purposes of determining the elimination of property,
26 new improvements, or newly taxable value in a governmental unit."
