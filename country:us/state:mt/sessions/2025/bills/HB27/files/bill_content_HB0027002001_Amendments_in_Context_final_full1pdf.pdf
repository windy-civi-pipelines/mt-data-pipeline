1 department shall conduct the appraisal following the appropriate uniform standards of professional appraisal
2 practice for mass appraisal promulgated by the appraisal standards board of the appraisal foundation. In
3 valuing the property, the department shall use information available from any source considered reliable.
4 Comparable properties used for valuation must represent similar properties within an acceptable proximity of
5 the property being valued. The department shall use the same valuation method to value residential properties
6 in the same neighborhood or subdivision unless there is a compelling reason to use a different approach.
7 (b) When valuing residential property under the cost approach, the department shall document
8 why the comparable sales model does not support usage of the comparable sales approach, including an
9 analysis of whether the cost approach is used for other class four residential property in the market area.
10 (4) The department may not adopt a lower or different standard of value from market value in
11 making the official assessment and appraisal of the value of property, except:
12 (a) the market value for agricultural implements and machinery is the average wholesale value
13 category as provided in published national agricultural and implement valuation guides. The valuation guide
14 must provide average wholesale values specific to the state of Montana or a region that includes the state of
15 Montana. The department shall adopt by rule the valuation guides used as provided in this subsection (4)(a). If
16 the average wholesale value category is unavailable, the department shall use a comparable wholesale value
17 category.
18 (b) for agricultural implements and machinery not listed in an official guide, the department shall
19 prepare a supplemental manual in which the values reflect the same depreciation as those found in the official
20 guide;
21 (c) (i) for condominium property, the department shall establish the value as provided in
22 subsection (5); and
23 (ii) for a townhome or townhouse, as defined in 70-23-102, the department shall determine the
24 value in a manner established by the department by rule; and
25 (d) as otherwise authorized in Titles 15 and 61.
26 (5) (a) Subject to subsection (5)(c), if sufficient, relevant information on comparable sales is
27 available, the department shall use the sales comparison approach to appraise residential condominium units.

1 Because the undivided interest in common elements is included in the sales price of the condominium units, the
2 department is not required to separately allocate the value of the common elements to the individual units being
3 valued.
4 (b) Subject to subsection (5)(c), if sufficient, relevant information on income is made available to
5 the department, the department shall use the income approach to appraise commercial condominium units.
6 Because the undivided interest in common elements contributes directly to the income-producing capability of
7 the individual units, the department is not required to separately allocate the value of the common elements to
8 the individual units being valued.
9 (c) If sufficient, relevant information on comparable sales is not available for residential
10 condominium units or if sufficient, relevant information on income is not made available for commercial
11 condominium units, the department shall value condominiums using the cost approach. When using the cost
12 approach, the department shall value the units individually and allocate only the common area elements to the
13 units based on the percentage of undivided interest in the condominium declaration.
14 (6) For purposes of taxation, assessed value is the same as appraised value.
15 (7) The taxable value for all property is the market value multiplied by the tax rate for each class of
16 property.
17 (8) The market value of properties in 15-6-131 through 15-6-134, 15-6-143, and 15-6-145 is as
18 follows:
19 (a) Properties in 15-6-131, under class one, are assessed at 100% of the annual net proceeds
20 after deducting the expenses specified and allowed by 15-23-503 or, if applicable, as provided in 15-23-515,
21 15-23-516, 15-23-517, or 15-23-518.
22 (b) Properties in 15-6-132, under class two, are assessed at 100% of the annual gross proceeds.
23 (c) Properties in 15-6-133, under class three, are assessed at 100% of the productive capacity of
24 the lands when valued for agricultural purposes. All lands that meet the qualifications of 15-7-202 and [section
25 1] are valued as agricultural lands for tax purposes.
26 (d) Properties in 15-6-134, under class four, are assessed at 100% of market value.
27 (e) Properties in 15-6-143, under class ten, are assessed at 100% of the forest productivity value

1 of the land when valued as forest land.
2 (f) Railroad transportation properties in 15-6-145 are assessed based on the valuation formula
3 described in 15-23-205.
4 (9) Land and the improvements on the land are separately assessed when any of the following
5 conditions occur:
6 (a) ownership of the improvements is different from ownership of the land;
7 (b) the taxpayer makes a written request; or
8 (c) the land is outside an incorporated city or town.
9 (10) For the purpose of this section, the term "compelling reason" includes but is not limited to the
10 following:
11 (a) there are no comparable sales in the neighborhood or subdivision;
12 (b) the comparable sales model prepared by the department shows that the subject property
13 cannot be valued using the market sales approach; or
14 (c) other residential properties in the same neighborhood or subdivision are also valued using the
15 cost approach and not the market sales approach."

18 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
19 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
20 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
21 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
22 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
23 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
24 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
25 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
26 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
27 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill

1 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
2 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
3 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
4 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
5 labor.
6 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
7 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
8 including newly taxable property.
9 (3) (a) For the purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:

12 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
13 (iv) subdivision of real property; and

15 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
16 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
17 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
18 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
19 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
20 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
21 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
22 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
23 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
24 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
25 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
26 following tax year.

11 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
12 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
13 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
14 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
15 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the
16 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
17 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
18 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
19 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
20 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
21 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
