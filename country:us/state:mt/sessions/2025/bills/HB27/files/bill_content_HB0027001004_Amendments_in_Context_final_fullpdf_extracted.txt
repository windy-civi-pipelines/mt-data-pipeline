15 agricultural land under this section. The department may require reapplication to determine whether land is still
16 actively devoted to agricultural use and shall notify a property owner who is required to reapply. A property
17 owner who fails to reapply in the required timeframe may provide the application within 30 days following the
18 date on the classification and appraisal notice.

3 in the same neighborhood or subdivision unless there is a compelling reason to use a different approach.
4 (b) When valuing residential property under the cost approach, the department shall document
5 why the comparable sales model does not support usage of the comparable sales approach, including an

24 available, the department shall use the sales comparison approach to appraise residential condominium units.
25 Because the undivided interest in common elements is included in the sales price of the condominium units, the
26 department is not required to separately allocate the value of the common elements to the individual units being
27 valued.
28 (b) Subject to subsection (5)(c), if sufficient, relevant information on income is made available to

1 the department, the department shall use the income approach to appraise commercial condominium units.
2 Because the undivided interest in common elements contributes directly to the income-producing capability of
3 the individual units, the department is not required to separately allocate the value of the common elements to
4 the individual units being valued.
5 (c) If sufficient, relevant information on comparable sales is not available for residential
6 condominium units or if sufficient, relevant information on income is not made available for commercial
7 condominium units, the department shall value condominiums using the cost approach. When using the cost
8 approach, the department shall value the units individually and allocate only the common area elements to the
9 units based on the percentage of undivided interest in the condominium declaration.
10 (6) For purposes of taxation, assessed value is the same as appraised value.
11 (7) The taxable value for all property is the market value multiplied by the tax rate for each class of
12 property.
13 (8) The market value of properties in 15-6-131 through 15-6-134, 15-6-143, and 15-6-145 is as

17 15-23-516, 15-23-517, or 15-23-518.
18 (b) Properties in 15-6-132, under class two, are assessed at 100% of the annual gross proceeds.
19 (c) Properties in 15-6-133, under class three, are assessed at 100% of the productive capacity of
20 the lands when valued for agricultural purposes. All lands that meet the qualifications of 15-7-202 and [section
21 1] are valued as agricultural lands for tax purposes.
22 (d) Properties in 15-6-134, under class four, are assessed at 100% of market value.

12 Section 8. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
14 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
15 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
16 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
17 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
18 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
19 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
20 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
21 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
22 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
23 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
24 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
25 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
26 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
27 labor.
28 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Megan Moore, HB0027.001.004
1 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
2 including newly taxable property.
3 (3) (a) For the purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
4 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
5 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
6 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
7 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
8 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
9 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
10 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
11 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
12 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
13 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
14 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
15 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
16 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
17 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
18 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
19 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
20 following tax year.
21 (c) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property
22 that was constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the
23 current year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
24 (d) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the
25 first sale of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
26 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
27 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:
28 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or

1 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
2 (6) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds
3 taxes received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
4 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
5 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
6 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
7 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
8 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the
9 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
10 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
11 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
12 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
13 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
14 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
15 (ii) a levy to repay taxes paid under protest as provided in 15-1-402;
16 (iii) an emergency levy authorized under 10-3-405, 20-9-168, or 20-15-326;
17 (iv) a levy for the support of a study commission under 7-3-184;
18 (v) a levy for the support of a newly established regional resource authority;
19 (vi) the portion that is the amount in excess of the base contribution of a governmental entity's
20 property tax levy for contributions for group benefits excluded under 2-9-212 or 2-18-703;
21 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
22 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
23 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
24 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
25 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
26 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
27 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) may not be included in the amount of property taxes
28 actually assessed in a subsequent year.

1 (10) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
2 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport

9 classification as provided in subsection (7). Land of 20 640 acres or more but less than 160 acres for which no
10 application for agricultural classification has been made is idle land and is valued as provided in 15-6-133(1)(c)

12 any year, it must continue to be valued, assessed, and taxed as agricultural until the department reclassifies the
13 property. A reclassification does not mean revaluation pursuant to 15-7-111.
14 (7) The department shall administer a program for the periodic review of property classified as
15 agricultural land under this section. The department may require reapplication to determine whether land is still
16 actively devoted to agricultural use and shall notify a property owner who is required to reapply. A property
17 owner who fails to reapply in the required timeframe may provide the application within 30 days following the
18 date on the classification and appraisal notice.

10 "15-8-111. Appraisal -- market value standard -- exceptions. (1) All taxable property must be
11 appraised at 100% of its market value except as otherwise provided.

13 and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge
14 of relevant facts.
15 (b) If the department uses the cost approach as one approximation of market value, the
16 department shall fully consider reduction in value caused by depreciation, whether through physical
17 depreciation, functional obsolescence, or economic obsolescence.
18 (c) If the department uses the income approach as one approximation of market value and

1 Comparable properties used for valuation must represent similar properties within an acceptable proximity of
2 the property being valued. The department shall use the same valuation method to value residential properties
3 in the same neighborhood or subdivision unless there is a compelling reason to use a different approach.
4 (b) When valuing residential property under the cost approach, the department shall document
5 why the comparable sales model does not support usage of the comparable sales approach, including an
6 analysis of whether the cost approach is used for other class four residential property in the market area.
7 (4) The department may not adopt a lower or different standard of value from market value in
8 making the official assessment and appraisal of the value of property, except:
9 (a) the market value for agricultural implements and machinery is the average wholesale value
10 category as provided in published national agricultural and implement valuation guides. The valuation guide
11 must provide average wholesale values specific to the state of Montana or a region that includes the state of
12 Montana. The department shall adopt by rule the valuation guides used as provided in this subsection (4)(a). If
13 the average wholesale value category is unavailable, the department shall use a comparable wholesale value
14 category.
15 (b) for agricultural implements and machinery not listed in an official guide, the department shall
16 prepare a supplemental manual in which the values reflect the same depreciation as those found in the official
17 guide;

19 subsection (5); and
20 (ii) for a townhome or townhouse, as defined in 70-23-102, the department shall determine the
21 value in a manner established by the department by rule; and
22 (d) as otherwise authorized in Titles 15 and 61.
23 (5) (a) Subject to subsection (5)(c), if sufficient, relevant information on comparable sales is
24 available, the department shall use the sales comparison approach to appraise residential condominium units.
25 Because the undivided interest in common elements is included in the sales price of the condominium units, the
26 department is not required to separately allocate the value of the common elements to the individual units being
27 valued.

1 the department, the department shall use the income approach to appraise commercial condominium units.
2 Because the undivided interest in common elements contributes directly to the income-producing capability of
3 the individual units, the department is not required to separately allocate the value of the common elements to
4 the individual units being valued.
5 (c) If sufficient, relevant information on comparable sales is not available for residential
6 condominium units or if sufficient, relevant information on income is not made available for commercial
7 condominium units, the department shall value condominiums using the cost approach. When using the cost
8 approach, the department shall value the units individually and allocate only the common area elements to the
9 units based on the percentage of undivided interest in the condominium declaration.
10 (6) For purposes of taxation, assessed value is the same as appraised value.

18 (b) Properties in 15-6-132, under class two, are assessed at 100% of the annual gross proceeds.
19 (c) Properties in 15-6-133, under class three, are assessed at 100% of the productive capacity of
20 the lands when valued for agricultural purposes. All lands that meet the qualifications of 15-7-202 and [section

12 Section 8. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
14 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
15 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
16 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
17 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
18 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
19 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
20 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
21 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
22 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
23 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
24 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
25 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
26 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
27 labor.
28 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any

1 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
2 including newly taxable property.
3 (3) (a) For the purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
4 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
5 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
6 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
7 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
8 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
9 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
10 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
11 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
12 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
13 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
14 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
15 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
16 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
17 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
18 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
19 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
20 following tax year.
21 (c) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property
22 that was constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the
23 current year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
24 (d) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the
25 first sale of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
26 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
27 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:

1 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
2 (6) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds
3 taxes received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
4 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
5 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
6 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
7 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
8 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for the
9 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
10 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
11 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
12 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
13 (9) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
14 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
15 (ii) a levy to repay taxes paid under protest as provided in 15-1-402;

20 property tax levy for contributions for group benefits excluded under 2-9-212 or 2-18-703;
21 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
22 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
23 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
24 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
25 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
26 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the authority.
27 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) may not be included in the amount of property taxes
28 actually assessed in a subsequent year.
