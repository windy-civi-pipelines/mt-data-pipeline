21 Section 1. Section 20-5-320, MCA, is amended to read:
22 "20-5-320. Out-of-district attendance by parent or guardian request with no extenuating
23 circumstances. (1) A child may be enrolled in and attend a school in a Montana school district that is outside
24 of the child's district of residence at the request of the child's parent or guardian as described in this section. If
25 the trustees of the district of attendance approve of the child's attendance in a school of the district, the parent
26 or guardian may be responsible for transportation.
27 (2) (a) Whenever a parent or guardian of a child wishes to have the child attend a school under the
28 provisions of this section, the parent or guardian shall apply to the trustees of the district where the child wishes

69th Legislature 2025 HB 250.1
1 to attend.
2 (b) The application must be made on an out-of-district attendance agreement form supplied by the
3 district and developed by the superintendent of public instruction.
4 The attendance agreement must set forth the financial obligations, if any, for costs incurred for
5 transporting the child under as provided in 20-5-323 and Title 20, chapter 10. Unless otherwise agreed by the
6 district of residence and the district of attendance, the family of a nonresident child whose application for
7 attendance has been approved is responsible for transportation of the child and the child is not an eligible
8 transportee as defined in 20-10-101. The district of attendance may discretionarily provide transportation
9 pursuant to 20-10-122.
10 (c) The trustees of the district of attendance may adopt policies for the application process,
11 including but not limited to reasonable timelines for the submission of applications.
12 (d) The trustees of the district of attendance shall serve children who are residents of the district
13 and nonresident children seeking enrollment under 20-5-321 prior to enrolling children under this section.
14 (e) In reviewing and determining whether to approve an application for attendance by a
15 nonresident child, the trustees of the district of attendance shall approve the application unless the trustees find
16 that the impact of approval of the application will negatively impact the quality of education for resident pupils by
17 grade level, by school, or in the district in the aggregate in one or more of the following ways:
18 (i) the approval would result in exceeding limits of:
19 (A) building construction standards pursuant to Title 50, chapter 60;
20 (B) capacity and ingress and egress elements, either by individual room or by school building, of
21 any fire code authorized by Title 50, chapter 3; or
22 (C) maximum student contact hours for a teacher of the class or maximum class sizes under
23 accreditation standards of the board of public education; or
24 (C)(D) evacuation elements of the district's adopted school safety plan;
25 (ii) the approval would impede meeting goals, standards, or objectives of quality that the trustees
26 have previously adopted in a plan for continuous educational improvement required under rules adopted by the
27 board of public education; or
28 (iii) the approval would risk jeopardizing the educational quality within the district because the

4 (C) suspended in another school or out of school in any school district in which the nonresident
5 child was enrolled in any of the 3 school fiscal years preceding the school fiscal year for which attendance is
6 requested. This subsection (2)(e)(iii)(C) does not apply to a student who is eligible for special education or
7 related services.
8 (f) The trustees of a district that receives more applications than the district can accommodate
9 under subsections (2)(e)(i) and (2)(e)(ii) may adopt and implement policy providing priority among the
10 applications on any rational basis that prioritizes the quality of education for students who are residents of the
11 district of attendance and the obligations of resident taxpayers.
12 (3) This section does not preclude the trustees of a district from approving an attendance
13 agreement for educational program offerings not provided by the resident district, such as the kindergarten or
14 grades 7 and 8 programs, if the trustees of both districts agree to the terms and conditions for attendance and
15 any transportation requirement. The tuition requirements under 20-5-323 and 20-5-324 apply to agreements
16 under this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the trustees of the resident district shall initiate the out-
17 of-district agreement.
18 (4) As used in 20-5-320 through 20-5-324, the term "guardian" means the guardian of a minor as
19 provided in Title 72, chapter 5, part 2."

26 attendance shall notify the parent or guardian of the child and the trustees of the district of residence involved in
27 the out-of-district attendance agreement of the anticipated date for approval or disapproval of the agreement.

6 superintendent of schools of the county of residence, and the county superintendent of schools of the county of
7 attendance, and the superintendent of public instruction.
8 (4) If an out-of-district attendance agreement is disapproved or no action is taken, the parent or
9 guardian may appeal the disapproval or lack of action to the county superintendent of the district of attendance
10 and, subsequently, to the superintendent of public instruction under the provisions for the appeal of
11 controversies pursuant to 20-3-107 and 20-3-210.
12 (5) For purposes of payment under 20-5-324(2), a nonresident student who becomes a resident by

14 the duration of the student's enrollment in the district for that school year."

19 child's district of residence under the provisions of 20-5-320 or 20-5-321, the district of residence shall pay the
20 district of attendance a percentage equal to the lesser of the percentage of either school district's adopted
21 general fund budget funded by BASE and over-BASE property tax levies in the year of attendance not to
22 exceed 35.3% of the tuition per-ANB amount for the year of attendance as described in 20-5-324.

25 year of attendance, not to exceed 35.3% of the tuition per-ANB amount for the year of attendance as described
26 in 20-5-324.
27 (c) Tuition amounts for partial-year attendance, including midyear changes in residency under 1-1-
28 215, must be prorated for the portion of the year the student is enrolled as a nonresident student, based on the
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 250
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 250.1
1 percentage calculated by dividing the number of days the student is enrolled by the number of pupil instruction
2 days scheduled by the school district of attendance in the year of attendance.
3 (2) Except for the tuition paid by the district of residence and the superintendent of public
4 instruction under 20-5-324(2)(b), the district of residence shall pay the district of attendance as described in 20-
5 5-324 the tuition for a child with a disability, and the amount of tuition must be the regular rate under subsection
6 (1), plus the special education tuition rate determined by the district of attendance under rules adopted by the
7 superintendent of public instruction for the calculation of tuition for special education pupils. The rules must
8 provide:
9 (a) that tuition amounts must be reduced by the funding generated by the district of attendance

26 calculation for tuition purposes is determined by totaling all of the expenditures for all of the district budgeted
27 funds for the preceding school fiscal year and dividing that amount by the October 1 enrollment in the preceding
28 school fiscal year. For the purposes of this subsection, the following do not apply:

69th Legislature 2025 HB 250.1
1 earmark a portion of the nonoperating fund balance as a nonoperating fund operating reserve when they
2 anticipate the reopening of a school in the following school fiscal year. The operating reserve may not be more
3 than the general fund operating reserve designated for the immediately preceding school fiscal year. If a school
4 is not operated in the following school fiscal year, the authority of the trustees to earmark a nonoperating fund
5 operating reserve terminates and the money earmarked as an operating reserve must be used to reduce the
6 levy requirement of the nonoperating fund. If the trustees acquire approval to reopen a school in the following
7 school fiscal year under the provisions of 20-6-502 or 20-6-503 and operate the school, the nonoperating fund
8 operating reserve must be restored as the general fund operating reserve.
9 (3) The purpose of the nonoperating fund is to centralize the financing and budgeting for the
10 limited functions of a district not operating a school. The functions include:
11 (a) elementary tuition obligations to other districts;
12 (b) transportation of the resident pupils;
13 (c) maintenance of district-owned property; and
14 (d) any other nonoperating school function of the district considered necessary by the trustees or

21 Section 1. Section 20-5-320, MCA, is amended to read:
22 "20-5-320. Out-of-district attendance by parent or guardian request with no extenuating
23 circumstances. (1) A child may be enrolled in and attend a school in a Montana school district that is outside
24 of the child's district of residence at the request of the child's parent or guardian as described in this section. If

1 to attend.
2 (b) The application must be made on an out-of-district attendance agreement form supplied by the
3 district and developed by the superintendent of public instruction.
4 The attendance agreement must set forth the financial obligations, if any, for costs incurred for
5 transporting the child under as provided in 20-5-323 and Title 20, chapter 10. Unless otherwise agreed by the
6 district of residence and the district of attendance, the family of a nonresident child whose application for
7 attendance has been approved is responsible for transportation of the child and the child is not an eligible
8 transportee as defined in 20-10-101. The district of attendance may discretionarily provide transportation
9 pursuant to 20-10-122.
10 (c) The trustees of the district of attendance may adopt policies for the application process,
11 including but not limited to reasonable timelines for the submission of applications.
12 (d) The trustees of the district of attendance shall serve children who are residents of the district
13 and nonresident children seeking enrollment under 20-5-321 prior to enrolling children under this section.
14 (e) In reviewing and determining whether to approve an application for attendance by a
15 nonresident child, the trustees of the district of attendance shall approve the application unless the trustees find
16 that the impact of approval of the application will negatively impact the quality of education for resident pupils by
17 grade level, by school, or in the district in the aggregate in one or more of the following ways:
18 (i) the approval would result in exceeding limits of:
19 (A) building construction standards pursuant to Title 50, chapter 60;
20 (B) capacity and ingress and egress elements, either by individual room or by school building, of
21 any fire code authorized by Title 50, chapter 3; or
22 (C) maximum student contact hours for a teacher of the class or maximum class sizes under
23 accreditation standards of the board of public education; or
24 (C)(D) evacuation elements of the district's adopted school safety plan;
25 (ii) the approval would impede meeting goals, standards, or objectives of quality that the trustees
26 have previously adopted in a plan for continuous educational improvement required under rules adopted by the
27 board of public education; or
28 (iii) the approval would risk jeopardizing the educational quality within the district because the

5 child was enrolled in any of the 3 school fiscal years preceding the school fiscal year for which attendance is
6 requested. This subsection (2)(e)(iii)(C) does not apply to a student who is eligible for special education or
7 related services.
8 (f) The trustees of a district that receives more applications than the district can accommodate
9 under subsections (2)(e)(i) and (2)(e)(ii) may adopt and implement policy providing priority among the
10 applications on any rational basis that prioritizes the quality of education for students who are residents of the
11 district of attendance and the obligations of resident taxpayers.
12 (3) This section does not preclude the trustees of a district from approving an attendance
13 agreement for educational program offerings not provided by the resident district, such as the kindergarten or
14 grades 7 and 8 programs, if the trustees of both districts agree to the terms and conditions for attendance and
15 any transportation requirement. The tuition requirements under 20-5-323 and 20-5-324 apply to agreements
16 under this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the trustees of the resident district shall initiate the out-
17 of-district agreement.
18 (4) As used in 20-5-320 through 20-5-324, the term "guardian" means the guardian of a minor as

8 (4) If an out-of-district attendance agreement is disapproved or no action is taken, the parent or
9 guardian may appeal the disapproval or lack of action to the county superintendent of the district of attendance
10 and, subsequently, to the superintendent of public instruction under the provisions for the appeal of
11 controversies pursuant to 20-3-107 and 20-3-210.

14 the duration of the student's enrollment in the district for that school year."

20 district of attendance a percentage equal to the lesser of the percentage of either school district's adopted
21 general fund budget funded by BASE and over-BASE property tax levies in the year of attendance not to
22 exceed 35.3% of the tuition per-ANB amount for the year of attendance as described in 20-5-324.

1 percentage calculated by dividing the number of days the student is enrolled by the number of pupil instruction
2 days scheduled by the school district of attendance in the year of attendance.
3 (2) Except for the tuition paid by the district of residence and the superintendent of public
4 instruction under 20-5-324(2)(b), the district of residence shall pay the district of attendance as described in 20-

69th Legislature 2025 HB 250.1
1 earmark a portion of the nonoperating fund balance as a nonoperating fund operating reserve when they
2 anticipate the reopening of a school in the following school fiscal year. The operating reserve may not be more
3 than the general fund operating reserve designated for the immediately preceding school fiscal year. If a school
4 is not operated in the following school fiscal year, the authority of the trustees to earmark a nonoperating fund
5 operating reserve terminates and the money earmarked as an operating reserve must be used to reduce the
6 levy requirement of the nonoperating fund. If the trustees acquire approval to reopen a school in the following
7 school fiscal year under the provisions of 20-6-502 or 20-6-503 and operate the school, the nonoperating fund
8 operating reserve must be restored as the general fund operating reserve.
9 (3) The purpose of the nonoperating fund is to centralize the financing and budgeting for the
10 limited functions of a district not operating a school. The functions include:
11 (a) elementary tuition obligations to other districts;
12 (b) transportation of the resident pupils;
13 (c) maintenance of district-owned property; and
14 (d) any other nonoperating school function of the district considered necessary by the trustees or
15 required by law.
16 (4) Any expenditure of nonoperating fund money must be made in accordance with the financial
17 administration provisions of this title for a budgeted fund."
