each service area;
(i) establish the methodology that the governmental entity will use to exclude operations and

(i) schedules construction of public facility capital improvements to serve projected growth;

(b) The initial amount of an impact fee calculated pursuant to this section may not be increased
more than the rate of inflation as determined by the producer price index by commodity, all commodities, using
the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
labor. The inflation rate must be determined by comparing the most recently published month producer price
index by commodity, all commodities, compared to the same month in the prior year.
(6) The ordinance or resolution adopting the impact fee must include a time schedule for
periodically updating the documentation required under subsection (2).
(7) An impact fee must meet the following requirements:
(a) The amount of the impact fee must be reasonably related to and reasonably attributable to the
development's share of the cost of infrastructure improvements made necessary by the new development.
(b) The impact fees imposed may not exceed a proportionate share of the costs incurred or to be
incurred by the governmental entity in accommodating the development. The following factors must be
considered in determining a proportionate share of public facilities capital improvements costs:
(i) the need for public facilities capital improvements required to serve new development; and
(ii) consideration of payments for system improvements reasonably anticipated to be made by or
as a result of the development in the form of user fees, debt service payments, taxes, and other available
sources of funding the system improvements.
(c) Costs for correction of existing deficiencies in a public facility may not be included in the impact
fee.
(d) New development may not be held to a higher level of service than existing users unless there
is a mechanism in place for the existing users to make improvements to the existing system to match the higher
level of service.
(e) Impact fees may not include expenses for operations and maintenance of the facility."
