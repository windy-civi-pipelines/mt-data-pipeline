Section 4:
Section 2. Section 46-18-203, MCA, is amended to read:
"46-18-203. Revocation of suspended or deferred sentence. (1) Upon the filing of a petition for
revocation showing probable cause that the offender has violated any condition of a sentence, any condition of
a deferred imposition of sentence, or any condition of supervision after release from imprisonment imposed
pursuant to 45-5-503(4), 45-5-507(5), 45-5-601(3), 45-5-625(4), or 45-5-711, the judge may issue an order for a
hearing on revocation. The order must require the offender to appear at a specified time and place for the
hearing and be served by delivering a copy of the petition and order to the offender personally. The judge may
also issue an arrest warrant directing any peace officer or a probation and parole officer to arrest the offender
and bring the offender before the court.
(2) The petition for a revocation must be filed with the sentencing court either before the period of
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 582
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 582
suspension or deferral has begun or during the period of suspension or deferral but not after the period has
expired. Expiration of the period of suspension or deferral after the petition is filed does not deprive the court of
its jurisdiction to rule on the petition.
(3) The provisions pertaining to bail, as set forth in Title 46, chapter 9, are applicable to persons
arrested pursuant to this section.
(4) Without unnecessary delay and no more than 60 days after arrest, the offender must be
brought before the judge, and at least 10 days prior to the hearing the offender must be advised of:
(a) the allegations of the petition;
(b) the opportunity to appear and to present evidence in the offender's own behalf;
(c) the opportunity to question adverse witnesses; and
(d) the right to be represented by counsel at the revocation hearing pursuant to Title 46, chapter 8,
part 1.
(5) A hearing is required before a suspended or deferred sentence can be revoked or the terms or
conditions of the sentence can be modified unless:
(a) the offender admits the allegations and waives the right to a hearing; or
(b) the relief to be granted is favorable to the offender and the prosecutor, after having been given
notice of the proposed relief and a reasonable opportunity to object, has not objected. An extension of the term
of probation is not favorable to the offender for the purposes of this subsection (5)(b).
(6) (a) At the hearing, the prosecution shall prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there
has been a violation of:
(i) the terms and conditions of the suspended or deferred sentence; or
(ii) a condition of supervision after release from imprisonment imposed pursuant to 45-5-503(4),
45-5-507(5), 45-5-601(3), 45-5-625(4), or 45-5-711.
(b) However, when a failure to pay restitution is the basis for the petition, the offender may excuse
the violation by showing sufficient evidence that the failure to pay restitution was not attributable to a failure on
the offender's part to make a good faith effort to obtain sufficient means to make the restitution payments as
ordered.
(7) (a) If the judge finds that the offender has violated the terms and conditions of the suspended
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 582
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 582
or deferred sentence by committing either compliance violations or noncompliance violations, or both, the judge
may:
(i) continue the suspended or deferred sentence without a change in conditions;
(ii) continue the suspended sentence with modified or additional terms and conditions, which may
include placement in:
(A) a secure facility designated by the department for up to 9 months; or
(B) a community corrections facility or program designated by the department for up to 9 months,
including but not limited to placement in a prerelease center, sanction or hold bed, transitional living program,
enhanced supervision program, relapse intervention bed, chemical dependency treatment, or 24/7 sobriety
program;
(iii) revoke the suspension of sentence and require the offender to serve either the sentence
imposed or any sentence that could have been imposed that does not include a longer imprisonment or
commitment term than the original sentence; or
(iv) if the sentence was deferred, impose any sentence that might have been originally imposed.
(b) If a suspended or deferred sentence is revoked, the judge shall:
(i) consider any elapsed time, consult the records and recollection of the probation and parole
officer, and allow all of the elapsed time served without any record or recollection of violations as a credit
against the sentence. A district court, in its discretion, may deny elapsed time credit for a reasonable period of
time related to a violation or multiple violations. A defendant is not entitled to elapsed time credit for time spent
in a correctional institution as defined in 45-2-101. If the judge determines that elapsed time should may not be
credited, the judge shall state the reasons for the determination in the order.
(ii) Credit must be allowed for time served in a detention centeror for home arrest time already
served allow credit for each day of incarceration or home arrest prior to imposition of a revocation sentence that
is directly related to the revocation proceedings pursuant to the limitations in 46-18-403(1)(b).
(c) If the judge finds that the offender has not violated a term or condition of a suspended or
deferred sentence, the judge is not prevented from setting, modifying, or adding conditions of probation as
provided in 46-23-1011.
(8) If the judge finds that the prosecution has not proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – HB 582
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 582
there has been a violation of the terms and conditions of the suspended or deferred sentence, the petition must
be dismissed and the offender, if in custody, must be immediately released.
(9) All sanction and placement decisions must be documented in the offender's file.
(10) As used in this section:
(a) "absconding" means when an offender deliberately makes the offender's whereabouts
unknown to a probation and parole officer or fails to report for the purposes of avoiding supervision, and
reasonable efforts by the probation and parole officer to locate the offender have been unsuccessful; and
(b) "compliance violation" means a violation of the conditions of supervision that is not:
(i) a new criminal offense;
(ii) possession of a firearm in violation of a condition of probation;
(iii) behavior by the offender or any person acting at the offender's direction that could be
considered stalking, harassing, or threatening the victim of the offense or a member of the victim's immediate
family or support network;
(iv) absconding; or
(v) failure to enroll in or complete a required sex offender treatment program or a treatment
program designed to treat violent offenders.
(11) The provisions of this section apply to any offender whose suspended or deferred sentence is
subject to revocation regardless of the date of the offender's conviction and regardless of the terms and
conditions of the offender's original sentence."

Section 5:
Section 3. Section 46-18-403, MCA, is amended to read:
"46-18-403. Credit for incarceration prior to conviction sentencing. (1) (a) A An incarcerated
person incarcerated on a bailable offense against whom a judgment of imprisonment is rendered must be
allowed credit for each day of incarceration prior to or after conviction imposition of a sentence that is directly
related to the proceedings that caused the incarceration, except that the time allowed as a credit may not
exceed the term of the prison sentence rendered.
(b) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), :
(i) credit must be given only when the custody to be credited is attributable to proceedings related
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – HB 582
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 582
to the same conduct for which the defendant has been convicted;
(ii) an offender is not entitled to credit against multiple sentences for a single period of custody
unless the sentences are imposed concurrently;
(iii) an offender is not entitled to credit in a new criminal matter if the offender is currently serving a
custodial sentence on a prior offense;
(iv) incarceration directly related to a probation or parole hold only reduces the sentence that the
person was serving while on probation or parole; and
(v) incarceration includes time spent in a correctional institution as defined in 45-2-101 and a
secure residential treatment facility under the order of a court if residence is required by court order.
(2) A An incarcerated person incarcerated on a bailable offense who does not supply bail and
against whom a fine is levied on conviction of the offense may be allowed a credit for each day of incarceration
prior to conviction imposition of sentence, except that the amount allowed or credited may not exceed the
amount of the fine. The daily rate of credit for incarceration must be established annually by the board of county
commissioners by resolution. The daily rate must be equal to the actual cost incurred by the detention facility
for which the rate is established."

revocation showing probable cause that the offender has violated any condition of a sentence, any condition of
a deferred imposition of sentence, or any condition of supervision after release from imprisonment imposed
pursuant to 45-5-503(4), 45-5-507(5), 45-5-601(3), 45-5-625(4), or 45-5-711, the judge may issue an order for a
hearing on revocation. The order must require the offender to appear at a specified time and place for the
hearing and be served by delivering a copy of the petition and order to the offender personally. The judge may
also issue an arrest warrant directing any peace officer or a probation and parole officer to arrest the offender
and bring the offender before the court.
(2) The petition for a revocation must be filed with the sentencing court either before the period of
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 582
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 582
suspension or deferral has begun or during the period of suspension or deferral but not after the period has
expired. Expiration of the period of suspension or deferral after the petition is filed does not deprive the court of
its jurisdiction to rule on the petition.
(3) The provisions pertaining to bail, as set forth in Title 46, chapter 9, are applicable to persons
arrested pursuant to this section.
(4) Without unnecessary delay and no more than 60 days after arrest, the offender must be
brought before the judge, and at least 10 days prior to the hearing the offender must be advised of:
(a) the allegations of the petition;
(b) the opportunity to appear and to present evidence in the offender's own behalf;
(c) the opportunity to question adverse witnesses; and
(d) the right to be represented by counsel at the revocation hearing pursuant to Title 46, chapter 8,
part 1.
(5) A hearing is required before a suspended or deferred sentence can be revoked or the terms or
conditions of the sentence can be modified unless:
(a) the offender admits the allegations and waives the right to a hearing; or
(b) the relief to be granted is favorable to the offender and the prosecutor, after having been given
notice of the proposed relief and a reasonable opportunity to object, has not objected. An extension of the term
of probation is not favorable to the offender for the purposes of this subsection (5)(b).
(6) (a) At the hearing, the prosecution shall prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there
has been a violation of:
(i) the terms and conditions of the suspended or deferred sentence; or
(ii) a condition of supervision after release from imprisonment imposed pursuant to 45-5-503(4),
45-5-507(5), 45-5-601(3), 45-5-625(4), or 45-5-711.
(b) However, when a failure to pay restitution is the basis for the petition, the offender may excuse
the violation by showing sufficient evidence that the failure to pay restitution was not attributable to a failure on
the offender's part to make a good faith effort to obtain sufficient means to make the restitution payments as
ordered.
(7) (a) If the judge finds that the offender has violated the terms and conditions of the suspended
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 582
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 582
or deferred sentence by committing either compliance violations or noncompliance violations, or both, the judge
may:
(i) continue the suspended or deferred sentence without a change in conditions;
(ii) continue the suspended sentence with modified or additional terms and conditions, which may
include placement in:
(A) a secure facility designated by the department for up to 9 months; or
(B) a community corrections facility or program designated by the department for up to 9 months,
including but not limited to placement in a prerelease center, sanction or hold bed, transitional living program,
enhanced supervision program, relapse intervention bed, chemical dependency treatment, or 24/7 sobriety
program;
(iii) revoke the suspension of sentence and require the offender to serve either the sentence
imposed or any sentence that could have been imposed that does not include a longer imprisonment or
commitment term than the original sentence; or
(iv) if the sentence was deferred, impose any sentence that might have been originally imposed.
(b) If a suspended or deferred sentence is revoked, the judge shall:
(i) consider any elapsed time, consult the records and recollection of the probation and parole
officer, and allow all of the elapsed time served without any record or recollection of violations as a credit
against the sentence. A district court, in its discretion, may deny elapsed time credit for a reasonable period of
time related to a violation or multiple violations. A defendant is not entitled to elapsed time credit for time spent
in a correctional institution as defined in 45-2-101. If the judge determines that elapsed time should may not be
credited, the judge shall state the reasons for the determination in the order.
(ii) Credit must be allowed for time served in a detention centeror for home arrest time already
served allow credit for each day of incarceration or home arrest prior to imposition of a revocation sentence that
is directly related to the revocation proceedings pursuant to the limitations in 46-18-403(1)(b).
(c) If the judge finds that the offender has not violated a term or condition of a suspended or
deferred sentence, the judge is not prevented from setting, modifying, or adding conditions of probation as
provided in 46-23-1011.
(8) If the judge finds that the prosecution has not proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – HB 582
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 582
there has been a violation of the terms and conditions of the suspended or deferred sentence, the petition must
be dismissed and the offender, if in custody, must be immediately released.
(9) All sanction and placement decisions must be documented in the offender's file.
(10) As used in this section:
(a) "absconding" means when an offender deliberately makes the offender's whereabouts
unknown to a probation and parole officer or fails to report for the purposes of avoiding supervision, and
reasonable efforts by the probation and parole officer to locate the offender have been unsuccessful; and
(b) "compliance violation" means a violation of the conditions of supervision that is not:
(i) a new criminal offense;
(ii) possession of a firearm in violation of a condition of probation;
(iii) behavior by the offender or any person acting at the offender's direction that could be
considered stalking, harassing, or threatening the victim of the offense or a member of the victim's immediate
family or support network;
(iv) absconding; or
(v) failure to enroll in or complete a required sex offender treatment program or a treatment
program designed to treat violent offenders.
(11) The provisions of this section apply to any offender whose suspended or deferred sentence is
subject to revocation regardless of the date of the offender's conviction and regardless of the terms and
conditions of the offender's original sentence."
Section 3. Section 46-18-403, MCA, is amended to read:
"46-18-403. Credit for incarceration prior to conviction sentencing. (1) (a) A An incarcerated
person incarcerated on a bailable offense against whom a judgment of imprisonment is rendered must be
allowed credit for each day of incarceration prior to or after conviction imposition of a sentence that is directly
related to the proceedings that caused the incarceration, except that the time allowed as a credit may not
exceed the term of the prison sentence rendered.
(b) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), :
(i) credit must be given only when the custody to be credited is attributable to proceedings related
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – HB 582
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 582
to the same conduct for which the defendant has been convicted;
(ii) an offender is not entitled to credit against multiple sentences for a single period of custody
unless the sentences are imposed concurrently;
(iii) an offender is not entitled to credit in a new criminal matter if the offender is currently serving a
custodial sentence on a prior offense;
(iv) incarceration directly related to a probation or parole hold only reduces the sentence that the
person was serving while on probation or parole; and
(v) incarceration includes time spent in a correctional institution as defined in 45-2-101 and a
secure residential treatment facility under the order of a court if residence is required by court order.
(2) A An incarcerated person incarcerated on a bailable offense who does not supply bail and
against whom a fine is levied on conviction of the offense may be allowed a credit for each day of incarceration
prior to conviction imposition of sentence, except that the amount allowed or credited may not exceed the
amount of the fine. The daily rate of credit for incarceration must be established annually by the board of county
commissioners by resolution. The daily rate must be equal to the actual cost incurred by the detention facility
for which the rate is established."
