19 "46-18-203. Revocation of suspended or deferred sentence. (1) Upon the filing of a petition for

22 pursuant to 45-5-503(4), 45-5-507(5), 45-5-601(3), 45-5-625(4), or 45-5-711, the judge may issue an order for a

28 suspension or deferral has begun or during the period of suspension or deferral but not after the period has

1 expired. Expiration of the period of suspension or deferral after the petition is filed does not deprive the court of
2 its jurisdiction to rule on the petition.
3 (3) The provisions pertaining to bail, as set forth in Title 46, chapter 9, are applicable to persons
4 arrested pursuant to this section.
5 (4) Without unnecessary delay and no more than 60 days after arrest, the offender must be
6 brought before the judge, and at least 10 days prior to the hearing the offender must be advised of:
7 (a) the allegations of the petition;
8 (b) the opportunity to appear and to present evidence in the offender's own behalf;

13 conditions of the sentence can be modified unless:
14 (a) the offender admits the allegations and waives the right to a hearing; or
15 (b) the relief to be granted is favorable to the offender and the prosecutor, after having been given
16 notice of the proposed relief and a reasonable opportunity to object, has not objected. An extension of the term
17 of probation is not favorable to the offender for the purposes of this subsection (5)(b).
18 (6) (a) At the hearing, the prosecution shall prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there
19 has been a violation of:
20 (i) the terms and conditions of the suspended or deferred sentence; or

22 45-5-507(5), 45-5-601(3), 45-5-625(4), or 45-5-711.
23 (b) However, when a failure to pay restitution is the basis for the petition, the offender may excuse
24 the violation by showing sufficient evidence that the failure to pay restitution was not attributable to a failure on
25 the offender's part to make a good faith effort to obtain sufficient means to make the restitution payments as
26 ordered.
27 (7) (a) If the judge finds that the offender has violated the terms and conditions of the suspended
28 or deferred sentence by committing either compliance violations or noncompliance violations, or both, the judge

11 imposed or any sentence that could have been imposed that does not include a longer imprisonment or
12 commitment term than the original sentence; or
13 (iv) if the sentence was deferred, impose any sentence that might have been originally imposed.
14 (b) If a suspended or deferred sentence is revoked, the judge shall:
15 (i) consider any elapsed time, consult the records and recollection of the probation and parole
16 officer, and allow all of the elapsed time served without any record or recollection of violations as a credit
17 against the sentence. A district court, in its discretion, may deny elapsed time credit for a reasonable period of
18 time related to a violation or multiple violations. A defendant is not entitled to elapsed time credit for time spent

24 proceedings pursuant to the limitations in 46-18-403(1)(b).
