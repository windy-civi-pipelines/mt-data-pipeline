for noneconomic loss deriving from injuries to a patient are subject to an award not to exceed $250,000. This
limitation applies whether:

in the same action, future noneconomic loss must be reduced first and, if necessary to reach the $250,000 limit,
past noneconomic loss must then be reduced. If a combination of awards is reduced to $250,000, a claimant's
share of the $250,000 must be the same percentage as the claimant's share of the combined awards before
