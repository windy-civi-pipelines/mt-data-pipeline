23 to commencement of construction, the abatement does not extend to property that is outside the scope of the
24 project plan that was submitted to the governing body with the application.
25 (c) The purpose of the public hearing is to determine whether the manufacturing machinery,
26 fixtures, and equipment eligible for an abatement has an impact on services. The governing body shall:
