14 promoting soil health, and maintaining ecosystems through responsible grazing practices; and
15 WHEREAS, Montana beef producers face numerous challenges, including fluctuating market prices,
16 rising feed and input costs, trade barriers, and increased competition from foreign beef imports that undermine
17 Montana ranchers' ability to thrive; and

1 trade agreements; and
2 WHEREAS, the state of Montana opposes the Green New Deal and similar far-left proposals that
3 threaten the cattle industry by promoting harmful regulations, restrictions, and tax policies aimed at limiting or
4 eliminating livestock production, which could undermine the economic viability of Montana's beef industry,
5 disrupt rural communities, and harm Montana's agricultural heritage.; and
6 WHEREAS, the state of Montana opposes the promotion, production, and sale of lab-grown "meat" as
7 a substitute for real, responsibly raised beef, recognizing that lab-grown meat is an untested and harmful

12 THE STATE OF MONTANA:

20 promotion of policies that support sustainable beef production, encourage the use of innovative agricultural
21 practices, and enhance the resilience of Montana's beef producers in the face of market challenges, climate
22 change, and global competition.
23 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Montana Legislature reaffirms its commitment to ensuring the
24 continued success and viability of Montana's beef industry, recognizing its significance in supporting rural
25 communities, preserving agricultural heritage, and maintaining Montana's position as a national leader in beef
