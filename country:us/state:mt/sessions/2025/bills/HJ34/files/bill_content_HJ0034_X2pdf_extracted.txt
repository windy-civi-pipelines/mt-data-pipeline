MONTANA SUPPORTING MONTANA'S BEEF PRODUCERS.

agricultural economy, with over 2.5 million cattle raised across the state, contributing significantly to the state's
gross domestic product, rural communities, and job market; and
WHEREAS, Montana's beef producers, including ranchers, farmers, and workers, are dedicated to
raising cattle in an environmentally responsible manner, upholding high standards for animal welfare, land
stewardship, and sustainability; and
WHEREAS, Montana's cattle ranchers have long been stewards of the land, preserving open space,
promoting soil health, and maintaining ecosystems through responsible grazing practices; and
WHEREAS, Montana beef producers face numerous challenges, including fluctuating market prices,
rising feed and input costs, trade barriers, and increased competition from foreign beef imports that undermine
Montana ranchers' ability to thrive; and
WHEREAS, Montana's beef industry is an essential contributor to local economies, providing jobs in
agriculture, transportation, food processing, and retail sectors, and playing an integral role in the survival of
many small towns and rural communities throughout the state; and
WHEREAS, Montana's high-quality beef is a respected product in national and international markets,
and supporting Montana's beef producers is critical to maintaining the state's reputation for producing some of

ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature - 2025 HJ 34
WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature recognizes the importance of ensuring that the state's beef
producers remain competitive, sustainable, and supported through favorable policies, market access, and fair-
trade agreements; and
WHEREAS, the state of Montana opposes proposals that threaten the cattle industry by promoting
harmful regulations, restrictions, and tax policies aimed at limiting or eliminating livestock production, which
could undermine the economic viability of Montana's beef industry, disrupt rural communities, and harm
Montana's agricultural heritage; and
WHEREAS, the state of Montana opposes the promotion, production, and sale of lab-grown "meat" as
a substitute for real, responsibly raised beef, recognizing that lab-grown meat is an untested and harmful
alternative that threatens the livelihoods of ranchers, distorts the marketplace, and poses significant questions
about food safety, environmental impact, and long-term health consequences.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the Montana Legislature strongly supports Montana's beef producers for their essential role in the
state's economy, culture, and way of life.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Montana Legislature calls on the state and federal governments
to prioritize policies that ensure fair market conditions, provide support for Montana ranchers, reduce
unnecessary regulatory burdens, and facilitate better trade relationships that open new markets for Montana
beef.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Montana Legislature encourages the development and
promotion of policies that support sustainable beef production, encourage the use of innovative agricultural
practices, and enhance the resilience of Montana's beef producers in the face of market challenges, climate
change, and global competition.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Montana Legislature reaffirms its commitment to ensuring the
continued success and viability of Montana's beef industry, recognizing its significance in supporting rural
communities, preserving agricultural heritage, and maintaining Montana's position as a national leader in beef
production.

production, and sale of lab-grown "meat" as a substitute for natural beef, and supports policies that protect the
integrity of Montana's beef industry and the safety of consumers by ensuring that only responsibly raised, high-

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State send a copy of this resolution to the
Governor of the State of Montana, to the United States Secretary of Agriculture, to each member of the
