16 Section 18. Section 20-9-502, MCA, is amended to read:
17 "20-9-502. Purpose and authorization of building reserve fund -- subfund structure. (1) The
18 trustees of any district may establish a building reserve fund to budget for and expend funds for any of the
19 purposes set forth in this section. Appropriate subfunds must be created to ensure separate tracking of the
20 expenditure of funds from voted and nonvoted levies and transfers for school safety pursuant to 20-9-236.
21 (2) (a) A voted levy may be imposed and a subfund must be created with the approval of the
22 qualified electors of the district for the purpose of raising money for the future construction, equipping, or
23 enlarging of school buildings or for the purpose of purchasing land needed for school purposes in the district. In
24 order to submit to the qualified electors of the district a building reserve proposition for the establishment of or
25 addition to a building reserve, the trustees shall pass a resolution that specifies:
26 (i) the purpose or purposes for which the new or addition to the building reserve will be used;
27 (ii) the duration of time over which the new or addition to the building reserve will be raised in
28 annual, equal installments;
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – ****
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC1726.1
1 (iii) the total amount of money that will be raised during the duration of time specified for the levy;
2 and
3 (iv) any other requirements under 15-10-425 and 20-20-201 for the calling of an election.
4 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b), a building reserve tax authorization may not be for
5 more than 20 years.
6 (c) The election must be conducted in accordance with the school election laws of this title, and
7 the electors qualified to vote in the election must be qualified under the provisions of 20-20-301. The ballot for a
8 building reserve proposition must be substantially in compliance with 15-10-425.
9 (d) The building reserve proposition is approved if a majority of those the electors voting at the
10 election approve the establishment of or addition to the building reserve as provided in 15-10-425. The annual
11 budgeting and taxation authority of the trustees for a building reserve is computed by dividing the total
12 authorized amount by the specified number of years. The authority of the trustees to budget and impose the
13 taxation for the annual amount to be raised for the building reserve lapses when, at a later time, a bond issue is
14 approved by the qualified electors of the district for the same purpose or purposes for which the building
15 reserve fund of the district was established. Whenever a subsequent bond issue is made for the same purpose
16 or purposes of a building reserve, the money in the building reserve must be used for the purpose or purposes
17 before any money realized by the bond issue is used.
18 (3) (a) A subfund must be created to account for revenue and expenditures for school major
19 maintenance and repairs authorized under this subsection (3). The trustees of a district may authorize and
20 impose a levy of no more than 10 mills on the taxable value of all taxable property within the district for that
21 school fiscal year for the purposes of raising revenue for identified improvements or projects meeting the
22 requirements of 20-9-525(2). The 10-mill limit under this subsection (3) must be calculated using the district's
23 total taxable valuation most recently certified by the department of revenue under 15-10-202. The amount of
24 money raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and
25 anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) may not exceed the district's school major maintenance amount.
26 For the purposes of this section, the term "school major maintenance amount" means the sum of $15,000 and
27 the product of $110 multiplied by the district's budgeted ANB for the prior fiscal year. To authorize and impose a
28 levy under this subsection (3), the trustees shall:
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – ****

69th Legislature 2025 LC1726.1
1 (i) following public notice requirements pursuant to 20-9-116, adopt no later than March 31 of
2 each fiscal year a resolution:
3 (A) identifying the anticipated improvements or projects for which the proceeds of the levy, the
4 deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to
5 20-9-525(3) will be used; and
6 (B) estimating a total dollar amount of money to be raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers
7 authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3), and the
8 resulting estimated number of mills to be levied using the district's taxable valuation most recently certified by
9 the department of revenue under 15-10-202; and
10 (ii) include the amount of any final levy to be imposed as part of its final budget meeting noticed in
11 compliance with 20-9-131.
12 (b) Proceeds from the levy may be expended only for the purposes under 20-9-525(2), and the
13 expenditure of the money must be reported in the annual trustees' report as required by 20-9-213.
14 (c) Whenever the trustees of a district impose a levy pursuant to this subsection (3) during the
15 current school fiscal year, they shall budget for the proceeds of the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized
16 under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) in the district's building
17 reserve fund budget. Any expenditures of the funds must be made in accordance with the financial
18 administration provisions of this title for a budgeted fund.
19 (d) When a tax levy pursuant to this subsection (3) is included as a revenue item on the final
20 building reserve fund budget, the county superintendent shall report the levy requirement to the county
21 commissioners by the later of the first Tuesday in September or within 30 calendar days after receiving certified
22 taxable values and a levy on the district must be made by the county commissioners in accordance with 20-9-
23 142.
24 (e) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for the deposit of proceeds from the
25 levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid
26 pursuant to 20-9-525(3).
27 (f) If the imposition of 10 mills pursuant to subsection (3)(a) is estimated by the trustees to
28 generate an amount less than the maximum levy revenue specified in subsection (3)(a), the trustees may

2 lawfully available fund of the district to the subfund provided for in subsection (3)(a), up to the difference
3 between the revenue estimated to be raised by the imposition of 10 mills and the maximum levy revenue
4 specified in subsection (3)(a). The district's local effort for purposes of calculating its eligibility for state school
5 major maintenance aid pursuant to 20-9-525 consists of the combined total of funds raised from the imposition
6 of 10 mills and additional funds raised from deposits and transfers in compliance with this subsection (3)(f).
7 (4) (a) A voted levy may be imposed and a subfund must be created with the approval of the
8 qualified electors of the district to provide funding for transition costs incurred when the trustees:

10 (ii) close a school;
11 (iii) replace a school building;
12 (iv) consolidate with or annex another district under the provisions of Title 20, chapter 6; or
13 (v) receive approval from voters to expand an elementary district into a K-12 district pursuant to
14 20-6-326.
15 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(c), the total amount the trustees may submit to the
16 electorate for transition costs may not exceed the number of years specified in the proposition times the greater
17 of 5% of the district's maximum general fund budget for the current year or $250 per ANB for the current year.
18 The duration of the levy for transition costs may not exceed 6 years.
19 (c) If the levy for transition costs is for consolidation or annexation:
20 (i) the limitation on the amount levied is calculated using the ANB and the maximum general fund
21 budget for the districts that are being combined; and
22 (ii) the proposition must be submitted to the qualified electors in the combined district.
23 (d) The levy for transition costs may not be considered as outstanding indebtedness for the
24 purpose of calculating the limitation in 20-9-406.
25 (5) (a) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for:
26 (i) the funds transferred to the building reserve fund for school safety and security pursuant to 20-
27 9-236; and
28 (ii) funds generated by a voter-approved levy for school and student safety and security pursuant

3 funding for improvements to school and student safety and security that meet any of the criteria set forth in 20-
4 9-236(1)(a) through (1)(e). A voted levy for school and student safety and security may not be considered as
5 outstanding indebtedness for the purpose of calculating the limitation in 20-9-406. The election for a voted levy
6 for school and student safety and security must be conducted in accordance with the school election laws of
7 this title, and the electors qualified to vote in the election must be qualified under the provisions of 20-20-301.

17 interest to become due in any year on the bonds and on any then-outstanding bonds for which revenue from
18 the same source or sources is pledged exceeds the amount of revenue to be received in that year as estimated

4 and interest and to create and maintain a reserve for the bonds may be paid from any revenue referred to in
5 this chapter, prior to the payment of current costs of operation and maintenance of the facilities.
6 (6) Subject to the conditions stated in this subsection, the governing body of any municipality

10 principal or interest then due, it shall, subject to 15-10-420, levy a general tax upon all of the taxable property in
11 the municipality for the payment of the deficiency. The governing body may further covenant that at any time a
12 deficiency is likely to occur within 1 year for the payment of principal and interest due on the bonds, it shall,
