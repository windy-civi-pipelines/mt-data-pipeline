11 without losing the authority to impose in a subsequent fiscal year up to the maximum amount or number of mills
12 approved in the election. However, nothing in this subsection authorizes a governing body to impose more than
13 the approved levy in any fiscal year or to extend the duration of the approved levy."

19 Section 18. Section 20-9-502, MCA, is amended to read:
20 "20-9-502. Purpose and authorization of building reserve fund -- subfund structure. (1) The
21 trustees of any district may establish a building reserve fund to budget for and expend funds for any of the
22 purposes set forth in this section. Appropriate subfunds must be created to ensure separate tracking of the
23 expenditure of funds from voted and nonvoted levies and transfers for school safety pursuant to 20-9-236.
24 (2) (a) A voted levy may be imposed and a subfund must be created with the approval of the
25 qualified electors of the district for the purpose of raising money for the future construction, equipping, or
26 enlarging of school buildings or for the purpose of purchasing land needed for school purposes in the district. In
27 order to submit to the qualified electors of the district a building reserve proposition for the establishment of or
28 addition to a building reserve, the trustees shall pass a resolution that specifies:
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 410
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 410.1
1 (i) the purpose or purposes for which the new or addition to the building reserve will be used;
2 (ii) the duration of time over which the new or addition to the building reserve will be raised in
3 annual, equal installments;
4 (iii) the total amount of money that will be raised during the duration of time specified for the levy;
5 and
6 (iv) any other requirements under 15-10-425 and 20-20-201 for the calling of an election.
7 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b), a building reserve tax authorization may not be for
8 more than 20 years.
9 (c) The election must be conducted in accordance with the school election laws of this title, and
10 the electors qualified to vote in the election must be qualified under the provisions of 20-20-301. The ballot for a
11 building reserve proposition must be substantially in compliance with 15-10-425.
12 (d) The building reserve proposition is approved if a majority of those the electors voting at the
13 election approve the establishment of or addition to the building reserve as provided in 15-10-425. The annual
14 budgeting and taxation authority of the trustees for a building reserve is computed by dividing the total
15 authorized amount by the specified number of years. The authority of the trustees to budget and impose the
16 taxation for the annual amount to be raised for the building reserve lapses when, at a later time, a bond issue is
17 approved by the qualified electors of the district for the same purpose or purposes for which the building
18 reserve fund of the district was established. Whenever a subsequent bond issue is made for the same purpose
19 or purposes of a building reserve, the money in the building reserve must be used for the purpose or purposes
20 before any money realized by the bond issue is used.
21 (3) (a) A subfund must be created to account for revenue and expenditures for school major
22 maintenance and repairs authorized under this subsection (3). The trustees of a district may authorize and
23 impose a levy of no more than 10 mills on the taxable value of all taxable property within the district for that
24 school fiscal year for the purposes of raising revenue for identified improvements or projects meeting the
25 requirements of 20-9-525(2). The 10-mill limit under this subsection (3) must be calculated using the district's
26 total taxable valuation most recently certified by the department of revenue under 15-10-202. The amount of
27 money raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and
28 anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) may not exceed the district's school major maintenance amount.
- 17 - Authorized Print Version – HB 410
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 410.1
1 For the purposes of this section, the term "school major maintenance amount" means the sum of $15,000 and
2 the product of $110 multiplied by the district's budgeted ANB for the prior fiscal year. To authorize and impose a
3 levy under this subsection (3), the trustees shall:
4 (i) following public notice requirements pursuant to 20-9-116, adopt no later than March 31 of
5 each fiscal year a resolution:
6 (A) identifying the anticipated improvements or projects for which the proceeds of the levy, the
7 deposits and transfers authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to
8 20-9-525(3) will be used; and
9 (B) estimating a total dollar amount of money to be raised by the levy, the deposits and transfers
10 authorized under subsection (3)(f) of this section, anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3), and the
11 resulting estimated number of mills to be levied using the district's taxable valuation most recently certified by
12 the department of revenue under 15-10-202; and
13 (ii) include the amount of any final levy to be imposed as part of its final budget meeting noticed in
14 compliance with 20-9-131.
15 (b) Proceeds from the levy may be expended only for the purposes under 20-9-525(2), and the
16 expenditure of the money must be reported in the annual trustees' report as required by 20-9-213.
17 (c) Whenever the trustees of a district impose a levy pursuant to this subsection (3) during the
18 current school fiscal year, they shall budget for the proceeds of the levy, the deposits and transfers authorized
19 under subsection (3)(f) of this section, and anticipated state aid pursuant to 20-9-525(3) in the district's building
20 reserve fund budget. Any expenditures of the funds must be made in accordance with the financial
21 administration provisions of this title for a budgeted fund.
22 (d) When a tax levy pursuant to this subsection (3) is included as a revenue item on the final
23 building reserve fund budget, the county superintendent shall report the levy requirement to the county
24 commissioners by the later of the first Tuesday in September or within 30 calendar days after receiving certified
25 taxable values and a levy on the district must be made by the county commissioners in accordance with 20-9-
26 142.
27 (e) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for the deposit of proceeds from the

1 pursuant to 20-9-525(3).
2 (f) If the imposition of 10 mills pursuant to subsection (3)(a) is estimated by the trustees to
3 generate an amount less than the maximum levy revenue specified in subsection (3)(a), the trustees may
4 deposit additional funds from any lawfully available revenue source and may transfer additional funds from any
5 lawfully available fund of the district to the subfund provided for in subsection (3)(a), up to the difference
6 between the revenue estimated to be raised by the imposition of 10 mills and the maximum levy revenue
7 specified in subsection (3)(a). The district's local effort for purposes of calculating its eligibility for state school
8 major maintenance aid pursuant to 20-9-525 consists of the combined total of funds raised from the imposition
9 of 10 mills and additional funds raised from deposits and transfers in compliance with this subsection (3)(f).
10 (4) (a) A voted levy may be imposed and a subfund must be created with the approval of the
11 qualified electors of the district to provide funding for transition costs incurred when the trustees:
12 (i) open a new school under the provisions of Title 20, chapter 6;
13 (ii) close a school;
14 (iii) replace a school building;
15 (iv) consolidate with or annex another district under the provisions of Title 20, chapter 6; or
16 (v) receive approval from voters to expand an elementary district into a K-12 district pursuant to
17 20-6-326.
18 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(c), the total amount the trustees may submit to the
19 electorate for transition costs may not exceed the number of years specified in the proposition times the greater
20 of 5% of the district's maximum general fund budget for the current year or $250 per ANB for the current year.
21 The duration of the levy for transition costs may not exceed 6 years.
22 (c) If the levy for transition costs is for consolidation or annexation:
23 (i) the limitation on the amount levied is calculated using the ANB and the maximum general fund
24 budget for the districts that are being combined; and
25 (ii) the proposition must be submitted to the qualified electors in the combined district.
26 (d) The levy for transition costs may not be considered as outstanding indebtedness for the
27 purpose of calculating the limitation in 20-9-406.
28 (5) (a) A subfund in the building reserve fund must be created for:

6 funding for improvements to school and student safety and security that meet any of the criteria set forth in 20-
7 9-236(1)(a) through (1)(e). A voted levy for school and student safety and security may not be considered as
8 outstanding indebtedness for the purpose of calculating the limitation in 20-9-406. The election for a voted levy
9 for school and student safety and security must be conducted in accordance with the school election laws of
10 this title, and the electors qualified to vote in the election must be qualified under the provisions of 20-20-301.
