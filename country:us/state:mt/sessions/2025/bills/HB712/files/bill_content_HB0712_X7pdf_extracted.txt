1, the restitution must be paid to the crime victims compensation and assistance program in the department of
justice for deposit in the account provided for in 53-9-113.
(3) If at any time the court finds that, because of circumstances beyond the offender's control, the
offender is not able to pay any restitution, the court may order the offender to perform community service during
the time that the offender is unable to pay. The offender must be given a credit against restitution due at the
rate of the hours of community service times the state minimum wage in effect at the time that the community

the offender or the offender's estate until full restitution is paid, whether or not the offender is under state
supervision. If the offender is under state supervision, payment of restitution is a condition of any probation or
parole.
(2) (a) The offender shall pay the cost of supervising the payment of restitution, as provided in 46-
18-245, by paying an amount equal to 10% of the amount of restitution ordered, but not less than $5.
