biennium. The inflation factor is calculated as follows:
(a) for the first year of the biennium, divide the consumer price index for July 1 of the prior calendar
year by the consumer price index for July 1 of the calendar year 3 years prior to the prior calendar year and
raise the resulting ratio to the power of one-third; and
(b) for the second year of the biennium, divide the consumer price index for July 1 of the current
calendar year by the consumer price index for July 1 of the calendar year 3 years prior to the current calendar
year and raise the resulting ratio to the power of one-third.
(2) The present law base for the entitlements referenced in subsection (1), calculated under Title
17, chapter 7, part 1, must consist of any enrollment increases or decreases plus the inflation factor calculated
pursuant to this section, not to exceed 3% in each year, applied to both years of the biennium. The legislature,
exercising its appropriation and lawmaking authority, may provide by law inflationary adjustments other than
those calculated in this section and in excess of 3%.
