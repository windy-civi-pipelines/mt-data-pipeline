8 A JOINT RESOLUTION OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF
9 MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY OF PERFLUOROALKYL AND POLYFLUOROALKYL
10 SUBSTANCES; AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE
11 70TH LEGISLATURE.
12
13 WHEREAS, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are a large, complex group of
14 synthetic chemicals that have been used in consumer products around the world since the mid-20th century;
15 and
16 WHEREAS, PFAS are present in many different commercial products, such as nonstick coatings, stain-
17 resistant and water-resistant products, protective coatings, personal health care products, firefighting foams,
18 and architectural resins; and
19 WHEREAS, some of the most widely used chemicals in the PFAS group, including perfluorooctane
20 sulfonate, or PFOS, and perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, are mobile, persistent, bioaccumulative, and are not
21 known to degrade in the environment; and
22 WHEREAS, people are most likely exposed to PFAS by consuming PFAS-contaminated water or food,
23 using products made with PFAS, or breathing air containing PFAS, but exposure to PFAS is difficult to assess
24 because new PFAS chemicals have been created in recent years; and
25 WHEREAS, multiple health effects associated with PFAS exposure have been identified and are
26 supported by different scientific studies, including reproductive effects, developmental effects or delays,
27 increased risk of some cancers, reduced ability of the body's immune system to fight infections, interference
28 with the body's natural hormones, and increased cholesterol levels or risk of obesity; and

69th Legislature Drafter: Chanan Brown, HJ0037.001.002
1 WHEREAS, state and local government agencies and nongovernment organizations scientists have
2 recommended eliminating or reducing the potential risks posed by exposure to PFAS to human health and the
3 environment; and
4 WHEREAS, research is ongoing to determine how different levels of exposure to different PFAS can
5 lead to a variety of health effects and to better understand the health effects associated with low levels of
6 exposure to PFAS over long periods of time; and
7 WHEREAS, PFAS accumulate in the residue of wastewater treatment plants throughout Montana,
8 amounting to toxic waste with no established method to store or dispose of it; and
9 WHEREAS, some residue with high levels of PFAS from wastewater treatment plants, known as
10 sludge, is used by ranchers, farmers, home gardeners, and others as fertilizer; and
11 WHEREAS, PFAS in fertilizer are absorbed by crops and enter the system of livestock, all of which are
12 then consumed by Montanans; and
13 WHEREAS, the Department of Environmental Quality has preliminarily studied PFAS, noted the health
14 risks associated with PFAS, and found extremely high amounts of PFAS in groundwater in various locations
15 throughout Montana; and
16 WHEREAS, statewide solutions should be explored in Montana to reduce or eliminate the potential
17 risks posed by PFAS to human health and the environment.

19 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
20 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
21 That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
22 committee, pursuant to section 5-5-217, MCA, or direct sufficient staff resources to:
23 (1) study the presence of PFAS in Montana, including potential sources of PFAS, sampling and
24 testing methods to identify the presence of PFAS, and routes of human and ecological exposure;
25 (2) examine the dangers associated with exposure to PFAS in Montana, including through
26 consumption in food and water systems; and
27 (3) investigate potential solutions to the harms associated with PFAS, including public health
28 interventions, environmental remediation, labeling requirements on products, recommendations to the

1 Department of Justice for legal actions to recover damages for injuries occurring in Montana caused by
2 manufacturers of PFAS, and the prohibition of the manufacturing or sale of certain products containing PFAS.
3 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the study is assigned to staff, any findings or conclusions be
4 presented to and reviewed by an appropriate committee designated by the Legislative Council.
5 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all aspects of the study, including presentation and review
6 requirements, be concluded prior to September 15, 2026.
7 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the final results of the study, including any findings, conclusions,
8 comments, or recommendations of the appropriate committee, be reported to the 70th Legislature.
