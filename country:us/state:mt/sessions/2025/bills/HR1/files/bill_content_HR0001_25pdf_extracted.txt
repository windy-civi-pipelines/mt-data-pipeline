7 (5) A committee may not meet during the time the House is in session without leave of the Speaker.
8 Any member attending such a meeting must be considered excused to attend business of the House subject to
9 a call of the House.
10 (6) All meetings of committees must be recorded and the audio recording logs must be available to the
11 public within a reasonable time after the meeting. The official record of the committee meeting is the audio
12 recording of the meeting, and the audio recording log must contain at least the following information:
13 (a) the time and place of each meeting of the committee;
14 (b) committee members present, excused, or absent;
15 (c) the names of persons appearing before the committee, whom each represents, and whether the
16 person is a proponent, opponent, or other witness;
17 (d) all motions and their disposition;
18 (e) the results of all votes;
19 (f) references to the audio recording, sufficient to serve as an index to the original recording and official
20 record; and
21 (g) testimony and exhibits submitted in writing.
22 H30-50. Procedures -- absentee or proxy voting -- member privileges. (1) The chairman shall notify
23 the sponsor of any bill pending before the committee of the time and place it will be considered.
24 (2) A standing or select committee may not take up referred legislation unless the sponsor or one of the
25 cosponsors is present or unless the sponsor has given written consent. The chairman shall attempt to not

- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HR 1
69th Legislature - 2025 HR0001.2
1 as provided in Joint Rule 40-200:
2 (i) by reporting the bill out of the committee:
3 (A) with the recommendation that it be referred to another committee;
4 (B) favorably as to passage; or
5 (C) unfavorably; or
6 (ii) by tabling the measure in committee.
7 (b) Except as provided in subsection (3)(c), at the written request of the sponsor made at least 48 hours
8 prior to a scheduled hearing, a bill may be withdrawn by the sponsor without a hearing. A bill may not be

11 (4) The committee may not report a bill to the House without recommendation.
12 (5) The committee may recommend that a bill on which it has made a favorable recommendation by
13 unanimous vote be placed on the consent calendar. A tie vote in a standing committee on the question of a
14 recommendation to the whole House on a matter before the committee, for example on a question of whether a
15 bill is recommended as "do pass" or "do not pass", does not result in the matter passing out to the whole House
16 for consideration without recommendation.
17 (6) In reporting a measure out of committee, a committee shall include in its report:
18 (a) the measure in the form reported out;
19 (b) the recommendation of the committee;

21 (d) a fiscal note, if required and available.
22 (7) If a measure is withdrawn from a committee and brought to the House floor for debate on second
23 reading on that day without a committee recommendation, the bill does not include amendments formally
24 adopted by the committee because committee amendments are merely recommendations to the House that are
25 formally adopted when the committee report is accepted by the House.
26 (8) A second to any motion offered in a committee is not required in order for the motion to be
27 considered by the committee.
28 (9) The vote of each member on all committee actions must be recorded. All motions may be adopted
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – HR 1

1 only on the affirmative vote of a majority of the members voting. Standing and select committees may by a
2 majority vote of the committee authorize members to vote by proxy if absent, while engaged in other legislative
3 business or when excused by the presiding officer of the committee due to illness or an emergency.
4 Authorization for absentee or proxy voting must be reflected in the committee audio recording log.
5 (10) A motion to take a bill from the table may be adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the

8 reconsideration and further formal action of the committee.
9 (12) A committee may reconsider any action as long as the matter remains in the possession of the
10 committee. A committee member need not have voted with the prevailing side in order to move reconsideration.
11 (13) (a) Except as provided in subsection (13)(b), legislation requested by a committee requires three-
12 fourths of all members of the committee to vote in favor of the question to allow the committee to request the
13 drafting or introduction of legislation. Votes requesting drafting and introduction of committee legislation may be
14 taken jointly or separately.
15 (b) The House Appropriations committee may request the drafting and introduction of legislation by a
16 majority vote of all of the members of the committee.
17 (14) The chairman shall decide points of order.

20 (b) to offer motions;
21 (c) to assert points of order and privilege;
22 (d) to question witnesses upon recognition by the chairman;
23 (e) to offer any amendment to any bill; and

25 form or through the vice chairman or minority vice chairman.
26 (16) Any meeting of a committee held through the use of telephone or other electronic communication
27 must be conducted in accordance with Chapter 3 of the House Rules.
28 (17) A committee may consolidate into one bill any two or more related bills referred to it whenever
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HR 1
69th Legislature - 2025 HR0001.2
1 legislation may be simplified by the consolidation.

5 in-person testimony from proponents, opponents, and informational witnesses must be allowed on every bill or
6 resolution before a standing or select committee. All persons, other than the sponsor, offering testimony shall
7 register on the committee witness list.
8 (2) Any person wishing to offer testimony to a committee hearing a bill or resolution must be given a
9 reasonable opportunity to do so, orally or in writing. Written testimony may not be required of any witness, but
10 all witnesses must be encouraged to submit a statement in writing for the committee's official record.
11 (3) The chairman may order the committee room cleared of visitors if there is disorderly conduct.
12 During committee meetings, visitors may not speak unless called upon by the chairman. Restrictions on time

19 H30-70. Ethics Committee. (1) The Ethics Committee shall meet only upon the call of the chair after
20 the referral of an issue from the Rules Committee or the Legislator Conduct Panel or to consider a request for a

22 matter to the Ethics Committee upon the request of a representative. The Rules Committee shall prepare a
23 written statement of the specific question or issue to be addressed by the Ethics Committee. Except for a
24 referral from the Legislative Conduct Panel, the issues referred to the Ethics Committee must be related to the
25 actions of a representative.
26 (2) The matters that may be referred to the Ethics Committee are:
27 (a) a violation of:
28 (i) 2-2-103, MCA;

20 (2) As to drafting, introduction, and referral, a House resolution is treated as a bill. A House resolution
21 may be requested and introduced at any time. Final passage of a House resolution is determined by the
22 Committee of the Whole report. A House resolution does not progress to third reading.
23 (3) The Chief Clerk shall transmit a copy of each passed House resolution to the Senate and the
24 Secretary of State.

23 limit for consideration of the legislation. All legislation received by the House may be referred to a committee
24 prior to being read across the rostrum.
25 H40-60. One reading per day -- exception. Except on the final legislative day, legislation may receive

- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HR 1
69th Legislature - 2025 HR0001.2
1 adopt a motion to reject an adverse committee report constitutes adoption of the report.
2 (3) If the House rejects an adverse committee report, the bill progresses to second reading, as
3 scheduled by the Speaker, with any amendments recommended by the committee.
4 H40-110. Consent calendar procedure. (1) Noncontroversial bills and simple and joint resolutions
5 may be recommended for the consent calendar by a standing committee and processed according to the
6 following provisions:
7 (a) To be eligible for the consent calendar, the legislation must receive a unanimous vote by the

11 (b) The legislation must then be sent to be processed and reproduced as a third reading version and
12 specifically marked as a "consent calendar" item.
13 (2) Other legislation may be placed on the consent calendar by agreement between the Speaker and

20 calendar and allow "reasonable time" for questions and answers upon request. No debate is allowed.

22 calendar, the legislation must be removed from the consent calendar and added to the regular second reading
23 board.
24 (5) Consent calendar legislation will be considered on Order of Business No. 8, third reading of bills,
25 following the regular third reading agenda, as separately noted on the agenda.

17 The Committee of the Whole may debate legislation, attach amendments, and recommend approval or
18 disapproval of legislation.
19 (3) Except on the final legislative day, at least 1 legislative day must elapse between the time legislation
20 is reported from committee and the time it is considered on second reading.
21 (4) If a motion to recommend that a bill "do pass" or "be concurred in" fails in the Committee of the
22 Whole, the obverse, i.e., a recommendation that the bill "do not pass" or "be not concurred in", is considered to
23 have passed. If a motion to recommend that a bill "do not pass" or "be not concurred in" fails in the Committee
24 of the Whole, the obverse, i.e., a recommendation that the bill "do pass" or "be concurred in", is considered to
25 have passed.

27 further legislative action.

10 Committee of the Whole amendments must be prepared by the Legislative Services Division and checked by

11 representative may not speak more than once on the motion and may speak for no more than 5 minutes. The
12 representative who makes the motion may speak a second time for 5 minutes in order to close.
13 (2) (a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), after at least two proponents and two opponents have

17 not include time spent on floor debate of a substitute motion to amend the original question.
18 (ii) Each substitute motion to amend the original question is subject to a cloture motion and the cloture
19 requirements provided for in this rule.
20 (iii) Once a substitute motion to amend is dispensed with and there are no other substitute motions to
21 amend, the 30-minute tolling requirement for the original question pursuant to subsection (2)(a) resumes from
22 the point in time in which the first substitute motion to amend was made.

15 except by majority vote.
16 (6) If a member moves to reopen a section for amendment, only the amendment of that member may
17 be entertained. Another member wishing to amend the same section shall make a separate motion to reopen
18 the section.
19 (7) Debate on the motion to reopen a section is limited to the question of reopening the section. The
20 amendment itself may not be debated at that time. This limitation does not prohibit the member from explaining
21 the amendment to be considered.
22 H40-190. Engrossing. (1) After legislation is passed on second reading, it must be engrossed within
23 48 hours under the direction of the Speaker. The Speaker may grant an additional 24 hours for engrossing.

25 must be placed on third reading on the following legislative day. If the bill is not amended, the bill must be sent
26 to printing and must be placed on third reading on the legislative day after receipt. On the final legislative day,
27 the correctly engrossed legislation may be placed on third reading on the same legislative day. For the
28 purposes of this rule, "engrossing" means placing amendments in a bill. (See Joint Rule 40-150.)

12 the House, rerefer House legislation with Senate amendments to a committee for a hearing if the Senate
13 amendments constitute a significant change in the House legislation. The second reading vote is limited to
14 consideration of the Senate amendments.
15 (2) If the House accepts Senate amendments, the House shall place the final form of the legislation on
16 third reading to determine if the legislation, as amended, is passed or if the required vote is obtained.
