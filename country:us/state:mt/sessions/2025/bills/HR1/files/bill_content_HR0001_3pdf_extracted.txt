ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature - 2025 HR0001
as provided in Joint Rule 40-200:

considered by the committee.

business or when excused by the presiding officer of the committee due to illness or an emergency.

(10) A motion to take a bill from the table may be adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
members present at any meeting of the committee.
(11) An action formally taken by a committee may not be altered in the committee except by
