12 (i) by reporting the bill out of the committee:

- 13 - Authorized Print Version – HR 1

6 adopted by the committee because committee amendments are merely recommendations to the House that are
7 formally adopted when the committee report is accepted by the House.
8 (8) A second to any motion offered in a committee is not required in order for the motion to be
9 considered by the committee.
10 (9) The vote of each member on all committee actions must be recorded. All motions may be adopted
11 only on the affirmative vote of a majority of the members voting. Standing and select committees may by a
12 majority vote of the committee authorize members to vote by proxy if absent, while engaged in other legislative
13 business or when excused by the presiding officer of the committee due to illness or an emergency.
14 Authorization for absentee or proxy voting must be reflected in the committee audio recording log.
15 (10) A motion to take a bill from the table may be adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the

13 next legislative day. The decision of the House Rules Committee may be appealed to the House by any
14 representative.
