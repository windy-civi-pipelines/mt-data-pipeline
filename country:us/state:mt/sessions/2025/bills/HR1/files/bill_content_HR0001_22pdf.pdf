19 (a) the time and place of each meeting of the committee;
20 (b) committee members present, excused, or absent;
21 (c) the names of persons appearing before the committee, whom each represents, and whether the

28 H30-50. Procedures -- absentee or proxy voting -- member privileges. (1) The chairman shall notify
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HR 1

69th Legislature - 2025 HR0001.2
1 the sponsor of any bill pending before the committee of the time and place it will be considered.
2 (2) A standing or select committee may not take up referred legislation unless the sponsor or one of the

6 and that has had a hearing prior to the last legislative day before the applicable transmittal deadline for the bill
7 as provided in Joint Rule 40-200:
8 (i) by reporting the bill out of the committee:
9 (A) with the recommendation that it be referred to another committee;
10 (B) favorably as to passage; or

20 recommendation to the whole House on a matter before the committee, for example on a question of whether a
21 bill is recommended as "do pass" or "do not pass", does not result in the matter passing out to the whole House
22 for consideration without recommendation.

24 (a) the measure in the form reported out;
25 (b) the recommendation of the committee;

3 formally adopted when the committee report is accepted by the House.
4 (8) A second to any motion offered in a committee is not required in order for the motion to be
5 considered by the committee.
6 (9) The vote of each member on all committee actions must be recorded. All motions may be adopted

8 majority vote of the committee authorize members to vote by proxy if absent, while engaged in other legislative
9 business or when excused by the presiding officer of the committee due to illness or an emergency.
10 Authorization for absentee or proxy voting must be reflected in the committee audio recording log.

14 reconsideration and further formal action of the committee.
15 (12) A committee may reconsider any action as long as the matter remains in the possession of the
16 committee. A committee member need not have voted with the prevailing side in order to move reconsideration.
17 (13) (a) Except as provided in subsection (13)(b), legislation requested by a committee requires three-
18 fourths of all members of the committee to vote in favor of the question to allow the committee to request the
19 drafting or introduction of legislation. Votes requesting drafting and introduction of committee legislation may be
20 taken jointly or separately.
21 (b) The House Appropriations committee may request the drafting and introduction of legislation by a
22 majority vote of all of the members of the committee.

3 form or through the vice chairman or minority vice chairman.
4 (16) Any meeting of a committee held through the use of telephone or other electronic communication
5 must be conducted in accordance with Chapter 3 of the House Rules.
6 (17) A committee may consolidate into one bill any two or more related bills referred to it whenever
7 legislation may be simplified by the consolidation.

16 all witnesses must be encouraged to submit a statement in writing for the committee's official record.
17 (3) The chairman may order the committee room cleared of visitors if there is disorderly conduct.
