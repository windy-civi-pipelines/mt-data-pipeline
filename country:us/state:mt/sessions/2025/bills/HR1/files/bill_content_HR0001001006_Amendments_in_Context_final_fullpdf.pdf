1 H30-50. Procedures -- absentee or proxy voting -- member privileges. (1) The chairman shall notify
2 the sponsor of any bill pending before the committee of the time and place it will be considered.
3 (2) A standing or select committee may not take up referred legislation unless the sponsor or one of the
4 cosponsors is present or unless the sponsor has given written consent. The chairman shall attempt to not
5 schedule Senate bills while the Senate is in session.
6 (3) (a) Subject to H30-60 and subsection (3)(b), the committee shall act on each bill in its possession
7 and that has had a hearing prior to the last legislative day before the applicable transmittal deadline for the bill
8 as provided in Joint Rule 40-200:
9 (i) by reporting the bill out of the committee:
10 (A) with the recommendation that it be referred to another committee;
11 (B) favorably as to passage; or
12 (C) unfavorably; or
13 (ii) by tabling the measure in committee.
14 (b) Except as provided in subsection (3)(c), at the written request of the sponsor made at least 48 hours

18 (4) The committee may not report a bill to the House without recommendation.
19 (5) The committee may recommend that a bill on which it has made a favorable recommendation by

21 recommendation to the whole House on a matter before the committee, for example on a question of whether a
22 bill is recommended as "do pass" or "do not pass", does not result in the matter passing out to the whole House
23 for consideration without recommendation.
24 (6) In reporting a measure out of committee, a committee shall include in its report:
25 (a) the measure in the form reported out;
26 (b) the recommendation of the committee;

2 reading on that day without a committee recommendation, the bill does not include amendments formally
3 adopted by the committee because committee amendments are merely recommendations to the House that are

5 (8) A second to any motion offered in a committee is not required in order for the motion to be
6 considered by the committee.
7 (9) The vote of each member on all committee actions must be recorded. All motions may be adopted
8 only on the affirmative vote of a majority of the members voting. Standing and select committees may by a

19 fourths of all members of the committee to vote in favor of the question to allow the committee to request the
20 drafting or introduction of legislation. Votes requesting drafting and introduction of committee legislation may be
21 taken jointly or separately.
22 (b) The House Appropriations committee may request the drafting and introduction of legislation by a
23 majority vote of all of the members of the committee.
24 (14) The chairman shall decide points of order.

3 (f) to vote, either by being present or by proxy if authorized pursuant to subsection (9), using a standard
4 form or through the vice chairman or minority vice chairman.
5 (16) Any meeting of a committee held through the use of telephone or other electronic communication

23 (4) Acknowledgment by the Chief Clerk of receipt of messages from the Senate or other elected

13 of representatives present may rearrange or remove legislation from either the second or third reading agenda

5 to printing and must be placed on third reading on the legislative day after receipt. On the final legislative day,
