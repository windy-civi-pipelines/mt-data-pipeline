22 register on the committee witness list.
23 (2) Any person wishing to offer testimony to a committee hearing a bill or resolution must be given a
24 reasonable opportunity to do so, orally or in writing. Written testimony may not be required of any witness, but
25 all witnesses must be encouraged to submit a statement in writing for the committee's official record.
26 (3) The chairman may order the committee room cleared of visitors if there is disorderly conduct.
27 During committee meetings, visitors may not speak unless called upon by the chairman. Restrictions on time

16 adopt a motion to reject an adverse committee report constitutes adoption of the report.
17 (3) If the House rejects an adverse committee report, the bill progresses to second reading, as
18 scheduled by the Speaker, with any amendments recommended by the committee.
19 H40-110. Consent calendar procedure. (1) Noncontroversial bills and simple and joint resolutions

4 (3) Legislation must be posted immediately (as soon as it is received appropriately printed) on the
5 consent calendar and must remain there for 1 legislative day before consideration under Order of Business No.

9 calendar, the legislation must be removed from the consent calendar and added to the regular second reading

7 is reported from committee and the time it is considered on second reading.
8 (4) If a motion to recommend that a bill "do pass" or "be concurred in" fails in the Committee of the
9 Whole, the obverse, i.e., a recommendation that the bill "do not pass" or "be not concurred in", is considered to
10 have passed. If a motion to recommend that a bill "do not pass" or "be not concurred in" fails in the Committee
11 of the Whole, the obverse, i.e., a recommendation that the bill "do pass" or "be concurred in", is considered to

14 further legislative action.
15 (6) When the Committee of the Whole reports to the House, the House shall adopt or reject the
16 Committee of the Whole report. If the House rejects the Committee of the Whole report, the legislation remains

3 (b) (i) The 30-minute tolling requirement for a cloture motion made pursuant to subsection (2)(a) does
4 not include time spent on floor debate of a substitute motion to amend the original question.
5 (ii) Each substitute motion to amend the original question is subject to a cloture motion and the cloture

3 the section.
4 (7) Debate on the motion to reopen a section is limited to the question of reopening the section. The

27 consideration of the Senate amendments.
28 (2) If the House accepts Senate amendments, the House shall place the final form of the legislation on

21 errors, shall, within 1 legislative day, certify the legislation as correctly enrolled.
22 (3) The correctly enrolled legislation must be delivered to the Speaker, who shall sign the legislation
23 within 1 day of receipt of the correctly enrolled legislation unless the bill sponsor concurs to delay the signing of
24 the enrolled legislation.
