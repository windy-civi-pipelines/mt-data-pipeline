1 (4) All committees shall provide for and give public notice, reasonably calculated to give actual notice to
2 interested persons, of the time, place, and subject matter of regular and special meetings. All committees are
3 encouraged to provide at least 3 legislative days' notice to members of committees and the general public.
4 However, a meeting may be held upon notice appropriate to the circumstances.
5 (5) A committee may not meet during the time the House is in session without leave of the Speaker.
6 Any member attending such a meeting must be considered excused to attend business of the House subject to
7 a call of the House.
8 (6) All meetings of committees must be recorded and the audio recording logs must be available to the
9 public within a reasonable time after the meeting. The official record of the committee meeting is the audio
10 recording of the meeting, and the audio recording log must contain at least the following information:
11 (a) the time and place of each meeting of the committee;
12 (b) committee members present, excused, or absent;
13 (c) the names of persons appearing before the committee, whom each represents, and whether the
14 person is a proponent, opponent, or other witness;
15 (d) all motions and their disposition;
16 (e) the results of all votes;
17 (f) references to the audio recording, sufficient to serve as an index to the original recording and official
18 record; and
19 (g) testimony and exhibits submitted in writing.
20 H30-50. Procedures -- absentee or proxy voting -- member privileges. (1) The chairman shall notify
21 the sponsor of any bill pending before the committee of the time and place it will be considered.
22 (2) A standing or select committee may not take up referred legislation unless the sponsor or one of the
23 cosponsors is present or unless the sponsor has given written consent. The chairman shall attempt to not
24 schedule Senate bills while the Senate is in session.
25 (3) (a) Subject to H30-60 and subsection (3)(b), the committee shall act on each bill in its possession
26 and that has had a hearing prior to the last legislative day before the applicable transmittal deadline for the bill

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: (H) Rules
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, HR0001.001.013
1 (A) with the recommendation that it be referred to another committee;
2 (B) favorably as to passage; or
3 (C) unfavorably; or
4 (ii) by tabling the measure in committee.
5 (b) Except as provided in subsection (3)(c), at the written request of the sponsor made at least 48 hours

9 (4) The committee may not report a bill to the House without recommendation.
10 (5) The committee may recommend that a bill on which it has made a favorable recommendation by
11 unanimous vote be placed on the consent calendar. A tie vote in a standing committee on the question of a
12 recommendation to the whole House on a matter before the committee, for example on a question of whether a
13 bill is recommended as "do pass" or "do not pass", does not result in the matter passing out to the whole House
14 for consideration without recommendation.
15 (6) In reporting a measure out of committee, a committee shall include in its report:
16 (a) the measure in the form reported out;
17 (b) the recommendation of the committee;

19 (d) a fiscal note, if required and available.
20 (7) If a measure is withdrawn from a committee and brought to the House floor for debate on second
21 reading on that day without a committee recommendation, the bill does not include amendments formally
22 adopted by the committee because committee amendments are merely recommendations to the House that are
23 formally adopted when the committee report is accepted by the House.
24 (8) A second to any motion offered in a committee is not required in order for the motion to be
25 considered by the committee.
26 (9) The vote of each member on all committee actions must be recorded. All motions may be adopted
27 only on the affirmative vote of a majority of the members voting. Standing and select committees may by a
28 majority vote of the committee authorize members to vote by proxy if absent, while engaged in other legislative

6 reconsideration and further formal action of the committee.
7 (12) A committee may reconsider any action as long as the matter remains in the possession of the
8 committee. A committee member need not have voted with the prevailing side in order to move reconsideration.
9 (13) (a) Except as provided in subsection (13)(b), legislation requested by a committee requires three-
10 fourths of all members of the committee to vote in favor of the question to allow the committee to request the
11 drafting or introduction of legislation. Votes requesting drafting and introduction of committee legislation may be
12 taken jointly or separately.
13 (b) The House Appropriations committee may request the drafting and introduction of legislation by a
14 majority vote of all of the members of the committee.
15 (14) The chairman shall decide points of order.
16 (15) The privileges of committee members include the following:
17 (a) to participate freely in committee discussions and debate;
18 (b) to offer motions;
19 (c) to assert points of order and privilege;
20 (d) to question witnesses upon recognition by the chairman;
21 (e) to offer any amendment to any bill; and
22 (f) to vote, either by being present or by proxy if authorized pursuant to subsection (9), using a standard
23 form or through the vice chairman or minority vice chairman.
24 (16) Any meeting of a committee held through the use of telephone or other electronic communication
25 must be conducted in accordance with Chapter 3 of the House Rules.
26 (17) A committee may consolidate into one bill any two or more related bills referred to it whenever
27 legislation may be simplified by the consolidation.
28 (18) Committee procedure must be informal, but when any questions arise on committee procedure,

16 must be operated. Cell phone use is allowed only at the discretion of the chairman.
17 H30-70. Ethics Committee. (1) The Ethics Committee shall meet only upon the call of the chair after
18 the referral of an issue from the Rules Committee or the Legislator Conduct Panel or to consider a request for a
19 determination pursuant to subsection (4). The Rules Committee may be convened to consider the referral of a
20 matter to the Ethics Committee upon the request of a representative. The Rules Committee shall prepare a
21 written statement of the specific question or issue to be addressed by the Ethics Committee. Except for a

15 H40-20. House resolutions. (1) A House resolution is used to adopt or amend House rules, make
16 recommendations on the districting and apportionment plan (Montana Constitution, Art. V, Sec. 14), express

11 (2) (a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), after at least two proponents and two opponents have
12 spoken on a question and 30 minutes have elapsed from the point in time that the sponsor's opening remarks
13 on the motion end and debate on the motion begins, a motion to call for cloture is in order.

15 not include time spent on floor debate of a substitute motion to amend the original question.
16 (ii) Each substitute motion to amend the original question is subject to a cloture motion and the cloture
17 requirements provided for in this rule.
18 (iii) Once a substitute motion to amend is dispensed with and there are no other substitute motions to

20 the point in time in which the first substitute motion to amend was made.
21 (c) Approval by not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting is required to sustain a

16 the section.
17 (7) Debate on the motion to reopen a section is limited to the question of reopening the section. The
18 amendment itself may not be debated at that time. This limitation does not prohibit the member from explaining
19 the amendment to be considered.
