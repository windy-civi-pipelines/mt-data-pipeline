8 (5) A committee may not meet during the time the House is in session without leave of the Speaker.
9 Any member attending such a meeting must be considered excused to attend business of the House subject to
10 a call of the House.
11 (6) All meetings of committees must be recorded and the audio recording logs must be available to the
12 public within a reasonable time after the meeting. The official record of the committee meeting is the audio
13 recording of the meeting, and the audio recording log must contain at least the following information:
14 (a) the time and place of each meeting of the committee;
15 (b) committee members present, excused, or absent;
16 (c) the names of persons appearing before the committee, whom each represents, and whether the
17 person is a proponent, opponent, or other witness;
18 (d) all motions and their disposition;
19 (e) the results of all votes;
20 (f) references to the audio recording, sufficient to serve as an index to the original recording and official
21 record; and
22 (g) testimony and exhibits submitted in writing.

24 the sponsor of any bill pending before the committee of the time and place it will be considered.

1 and that has had a hearing prior to the last legislative day before the applicable transmittal deadline for the bill
2 as provided in Joint Rule 40-200:
3 (i) by reporting the bill out of the committee:
4 (A) with the recommendation that it be referred to another committee;
5 (B) favorably as to passage; or
6 (C) unfavorably; or
7 (ii) by tabling the measure in committee.
8 (b) Except as provided in subsection (3)(c), at the written request of the sponsor made at least 48 hours

12 (4) The committee may not report a bill to the House without recommendation.
13 (5) The committee may recommend that a bill on which it has made a favorable recommendation by
14 unanimous vote be placed on the consent calendar. A tie vote in a standing committee on the question of a
15 recommendation to the whole House on a matter before the committee, for example on a question of whether a
16 bill is recommended as "do pass" or "do not pass", does not result in the matter passing out to the whole House
17 for consideration without recommendation.
18 (6) In reporting a measure out of committee, a committee shall include in its report:
19 (a) the measure in the form reported out;
20 (b) the recommendation of the committee;

23 (7) If a measure is withdrawn from a committee and brought to the House floor for debate on second

26 formally adopted when the committee report is accepted by the House.
27 (8) A second to any motion offered in a committee is not required in order for the motion to be
28 considered by the committee.

11 committee. A committee member need not have voted with the prevailing side in order to move reconsideration.
12 (13) (a) Except as provided in subsection (13)(b), legislation requested by a committee requires three-
13 fourths of all members of the committee to vote in favor of the question to allow the committee to request the
14 drafting or introduction of legislation. Votes requesting drafting and introduction of committee legislation may be
15 taken jointly or separately.
16 (b) The House Appropriations committee may request the drafting and introduction of legislation by a
17 majority vote of all of the members of the committee.

23 (d) to question witnesses upon recognition by the chairman;
24 (e) to offer any amendment to any bill; and

9 (2) Any person wishing to offer testimony to a committee hearing a bill or resolution must be given a
10 reasonable opportunity to do so, orally or in writing. Written testimony may not be required of any witness, but
11 all witnesses must be encouraged to submit a statement in writing for the committee's official record.
12 (3) The chairman may order the committee room cleared of visitors if there is disorderly conduct.

24 written statement of the specific question or issue to be addressed by the Ethics Committee. Except for a
25 referral from the Legislative Conduct Panel, the issues referred to the Ethics Committee must be related to the
26 actions of a representative.
27 (2) The matters that may be referred to the Ethics Committee are:

21 (2) As to drafting, introduction, and referral, a House resolution is treated as a bill. A House resolution
22 may be requested and introduced at any time. Final passage of a House resolution is determined by the
23 Committee of the Whole report. A House resolution does not progress to third reading.
24 (3) The Chief Clerk shall transmit a copy of each passed House resolution to the Senate and the

21 calendar and allow "reasonable time" for questions and answers upon request. No debate is allowed.

23 calendar, the legislation must be removed from the consent calendar and added to the regular second reading

21 is reported from committee and the time it is considered on second reading.
22 (4) If a motion to recommend that a bill "do pass" or "be concurred in" fails in the Committee of the
23 Whole, the obverse, i.e., a recommendation that the bill "do not pass" or "be not concurred in", is considered to
24 have passed. If a motion to recommend that a bill "do not pass" or "be not concurred in" fails in the Committee
25 of the Whole, the obverse, i.e., a recommendation that the bill "do pass" or "be concurred in", is considered to

18 not include time spent on floor debate of a substitute motion to amend the original question.
19 (ii) Each substitute motion to amend the original question is subject to a cloture motion and the cloture
20 requirements provided for in this rule.
21 (iii) Once a substitute motion to amend is dispensed with and there are no other substitute motions to

16 except by majority vote.
17 (6) If a member moves to reopen a section for amendment, only the amendment of that member may
18 be entertained. Another member wishing to amend the same section shall make a separate motion to reopen
19 the section.
20 (7) Debate on the motion to reopen a section is limited to the question of reopening the section. The
21 amendment itself may not be debated at that time. This limitation does not prohibit the member from explaining
22 the amendment to be considered.
23 H40-190. Engrossing. (1) After legislation is passed on second reading, it must be engrossed within
24 48 hours under the direction of the Speaker. The Speaker may grant an additional 24 hours for engrossing.

27 to printing and must be placed on third reading on the legislative day after receipt. On the final legislative day,
28 the correctly engrossed legislation may be placed on third reading on the same legislative day. For the
- 25 - Authorized Print Version – HR 1
