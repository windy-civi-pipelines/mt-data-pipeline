26 However, a meeting may be held upon notice appropriate to the circumstances.
27 (5) A committee may not meet during the time the House is in session without leave of the Speaker.
28 Any member attending such a meeting must be considered excused to attend business of the House subject to

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Steve Fitzpatrick - (H) Rules
69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, HR0001.001.001
1 a call of the House.
2 (6) All meetings of committees must be recorded and the audio recording logs must be available to the
3 public within a reasonable time after the meeting. The official record of the committee meeting is the audio
4 recording of the meeting, and the audio recording log must contain at least the following information:
5 (a) the time and place of each meeting of the committee;
6 (b) committee members present, excused, or absent;
7 (c) the names of persons appearing before the committee, whom each represents, and whether the
8 person is a proponent, opponent, or other witness;
9 (d) all motions and their disposition;
10 (e) the results of all votes;
11 (f) references to the audio recording, sufficient to serve as an index to the original recording and official
12 record; and
13 (g) testimony and exhibits submitted in writing.
14 H30-50. Procedures -- absentee or proxy voting -- member privileges. (1) The chairman shall notify
15 the sponsor of any bill pending before the committee of the time and place it will be considered.
16 (2) A standing or select committee may not take up referred legislation unless the sponsor or one of the
17 cosponsors is present or unless the sponsor has given written consent. The chairman shall attempt to not
18 schedule Senate bills while the Senate is in session.
19 (3) (a) Subject to H30-60 and subsection (3)(b), the committee shall act on each bill in its possession
20 and that has had a hearing prior to the last legislative day before the applicable transmittal deadline for the bill
21 as provided in Joint Rule 40-200:
22 (i) by reporting the bill out of the committee:
23 (A) with the recommendation that it be referred to another committee;
24 (B) favorably as to passage; or
25 (C) unfavorably; or
26 (ii) by tabling the measure in committee.

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Steve Fitzpatrick - (H) Rules

3 (4) The committee may not report a bill to the House without recommendation.
4 (5) The committee may recommend that a bill on which it has made a favorable recommendation by
5 unanimous vote be placed on the consent calendar. A tie vote in a standing committee on the question of a
6 recommendation to the whole House on a matter before the committee, for example on a question of whether a
7 bill is recommended as "do pass" or "do not pass", does not result in the matter passing out to the whole House
8 for consideration without recommendation.
9 (6) In reporting a measure out of committee, a committee shall include in its report:
10 (a) the measure in the form reported out;
11 (b) the recommendation of the committee;

14 (7) If a measure is withdrawn from a committee and brought to the House floor for debate on second
15 reading on that day without a committee recommendation, the bill does not include amendments formally
16 adopted by the committee because committee amendments are merely recommendations to the House that are
17 formally adopted when the committee report is accepted by the House.
18 (8) A second to any motion offered in a committee is not required in order for the motion to be
19 considered by the committee.
20 (9) The vote of each member on all committee actions must be recorded. All motions may be adopted
21 only on the affirmative vote of a majority of the members voting. Standing and select committees may by a
22 majority vote of the committee authorize members to vote by proxy if absent, while engaged in other legislative
23 business or when excused by the presiding officer of the committee due to illness or an emergency.
24 Authorization for absentee or proxy voting must be reflected in the committee audio recording log.
25 (10) A motion to take a bill from the table may be adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
26 members present at any meeting of the committee.
27 (11) An action formally taken by a committee may not be altered in the committee except by
28 reconsideration and further formal action of the committee.

1 (12) A committee may reconsider any action as long as the matter remains in the possession of the
2 committee. A committee member need not have voted with the prevailing side in order to move reconsideration.
3 (13) (a) Except as provided in subsection (13)(b), legislation requested by a committee requires three-
4 fourths of all members of the committee to vote in favor of the question to allow the committee to request the
5 drafting or introduction of legislation. Votes requesting drafting and introduction of committee legislation may be
6 taken jointly or separately.
7 (b) The House Appropriations committee may request the drafting and introduction of legislation by a

9 (14) The chairman shall decide points of order.
10 (15) The privileges of committee members include the following:
11 (a) to participate freely in committee discussions and debate;
12 (b) to offer motions;
13 (c) to assert points of order and privilege;

17 form or through the vice chairman or minority vice chairman.
18 (16) Any meeting of a committee held through the use of telephone or other electronic communication
19 must be conducted in accordance with Chapter 3 of the House Rules.
20 (17) A committee may consolidate into one bill any two or more related bills referred to it whenever
21 legislation may be simplified by the consolidation.

25 in-person testimony from proponents, opponents, and informational witnesses must be allowed on every bill or
26 resolution before a standing or select committee. All persons, other than the sponsor, offering testimony shall
27 register on the committee witness list.
28 (2) Any person wishing to offer testimony to a committee hearing a bill or resolution must be given a

10 must be operated. Cell phone use is allowed only at the discretion of the chairman.
11 H30-70. Ethics Committee. (1) The Ethics Committee shall meet only upon the call of the chair after
12 the referral of an issue from the Rules Committee or the Legislator Conduct Panel or to consider a request for a
13 determination pursuant to subsection (4). The Rules Committee may be convened to consider the referral of a
14 matter to the Ethics Committee upon the request of a representative. The Rules Committee shall prepare a
15 written statement of the specific question or issue to be addressed by the Ethics Committee. Except for a
16 referral from the Legislative Conduct Panel, the issues referred to the Ethics Committee must be related to the
17 actions of a representative.
18 (2) The matters that may be referred to the Ethics Committee are:

7 Services Division after the deadline for preintroduction, the representative may not introduce that legislation
8 after 2 legislative days from the time the bill was accepted from the Legislative Services Division.
9 H40-20. House resolutions. (1) A House resolution is used to adopt or amend House rules, make
10 recommendations on the districting and apportionment plan (Montana Constitution, Art. V, Sec. 14), express
11 the sentiment of the House, or assist House operations.
12 (2) As to drafting, introduction, and referral, a House resolution is treated as a bill. A House resolution

14 Committee of the Whole report. A House resolution does not progress to third reading.
15 (3) The Chief Clerk shall transmit a copy of each passed House resolution to the Senate and the
16 Secretary of State.
17 H40-30. Cosponsors. (1) Within 2 days from the date that the chief sponsor signs and accepts

15 limit for consideration of the legislation. All legislation received by the House may be referred to a committee

17 H40-60. One reading per day -- exception. Except on the final legislative day, legislation may receive
18 no more than one reading per legislative day. On the final legislative day, legislation may receive more than one

24 committee, joint select committee, or joint special committee.
25 H40-80. Rereferral -- Appropriations Committee rereferral -- normal progression. (1) Legislation
26 that is in the possession of the House and that has not had a House hearing in the currently assigned House

19 and, on the following legislative day, may be debated and adopted or rejected on Order of Business No. 2. A
20 motion to reject an adverse committee report must be approved by a majority of the members voting. Failure to
21 adopt a motion to reject an adverse committee report constitutes adoption of the report.
22 (3) If the House rejects an adverse committee report, the bill progresses to second reading, as
23 scheduled by the Speaker, with any amendments recommended by the committee.
24 H40-110. Consent calendar procedure. (1) Noncontroversial bills and simple and joint resolutions
25 may be recommended for the consent calendar by a standing committee and processed according to the

69th Legislature - 2025 Drafter: Todd Everts, HR0001.001.001
1 be made and passed unanimously to place the legislation on the consent calendar and this action reflected in

3 (b) The legislation must then be sent to be processed and reproduced as a third reading version and
4 specifically marked as a "consent calendar" item.
5 (2) Other legislation may be placed on the consent calendar by agreement between the Speaker and
6 the minority leader following a positive recommendation by a standing committee. The legislation must be sent
7 to be processed as a second reading version but must be specifically announced and posted as a "consent
8 calendar" item.
9 (3) Legislation must be posted immediately (as soon as it is received appropriately printed) on the
10 consent calendar and must remain there for 1 legislative day before consideration under Order of Business No.
11 11, special orders of the day. At that time, the presiding officer shall announce consideration of the consent
12 calendar and allow "reasonable time" for questions and answers upon request. No debate is allowed.

14 calendar, the legislation must be removed from the consent calendar and added to the regular second reading
15 board.

10 disapproval of legislation.
11 (3) Except on the final legislative day, at least 1 legislative day must elapse between the time legislation
12 is reported from committee and the time it is considered on second reading.
13 (4) If a motion to recommend that a bill "do pass" or "be concurred in" fails in the Committee of the
14 Whole, the obverse, i.e., a recommendation that the bill "do not pass" or "be not concurred in", is considered to
15 have passed. If a motion to recommend that a bill "do not pass" or "be not concurred in" fails in the Committee
16 of the Whole, the obverse, i.e., a recommendation that the bill "do pass" or "be concurred in", is considered to
17 have passed.
18 (5) An amendment attached to legislation by the Committee of the Whole remains unless removed by
19 further legislative action.
20 (6) When the Committee of the Whole reports to the House, the House shall adopt or reject the
21 Committee of the Whole report. If the House rejects the Committee of the Whole report, the legislation remains
22 on second reading, as amended by the Committee of the Whole, and must be acted on by the Committee of the
23 Whole by the next legislative day unless the House orders otherwise.
24 (7) A representative may move to segregate legislation from the Committee of the Whole report before
25 the report is adopted. Segregated legislation, as amended by the Committee of the Whole, must be placed on

3 representative may not speak more than once on the motion and may speak for no more than 5 minutes. The
4 representative who makes the motion may speak a second time for 5 minutes in order to close.

6 spoken on a question and 30 minutes have elapsed from the point in time that the sponsor's opening remarks
7 on the motion end and debate on the motion begins, a motion to call for cloture is in order.

9 not include time spent on floor debate of a substitute motion to amend the original question.
10 (ii) Each substitute motion to amend the original question is subject to a cloture motion and the cloture
11 requirements provided for in this rule.
12 (iii) Once a substitute motion to amend is dispensed with and there are no other substitute motions to

14 the point in time in which the first substitute motion to amend was made.

9 be entertained. Another member wishing to amend the same section shall make a separate motion to reopen
10 the section.
11 (7) Debate on the motion to reopen a section is limited to the question of reopening the section. The
12 amendment itself may not be debated at that time. This limitation does not prohibit the member from explaining
13 the amendment to be considered.

7 bill is recommended as "do pass" or "do not pass", does not result in the matter passing out to the whole House

10 (a) the measure in the form reported out;
11 (b) the recommendation of the committee;

14 (7) If a measure is withdrawn from a committee and brought to the House floor for debate on second

17 formally adopted when the committee report is accepted by the House.
18 (8) A second to any motion offered in a committee is not required in order for the motion to be
19 considered by the committee.
20 (9) The vote of each member on all committee actions must be recorded. All motions may be adopted

2 committee. A committee member need not have voted with the prevailing side in order to move reconsideration.
3 (13) (a) Except as provided in subsection (13)(b), legislation requested by a committee requires three-
4 fourths of all members of the committee to vote in favor of the question to allow the committee to request the

17 form or through the vice chairman or minority vice chairman.
18 (16) Any meeting of a committee held through the use of telephone or other electronic communication
19 must be conducted in accordance with Chapter 3 of the House Rules.
20 (17) A committee may consolidate into one bill any two or more related bills referred to it whenever
21 legislation may be simplified by the consolidation.

27 register on the committee witness list.
28 (2) Any person wishing to offer testimony to a committee hearing a bill or resolution must be given a

14 matter to the Ethics Committee upon the request of a representative. The Rules Committee shall prepare a
15 written statement of the specific question or issue to be addressed by the Ethics Committee. Except for a

12 is reported from committee and the time it is considered on second reading.
13 (4) If a motion to recommend that a bill "do pass" or "be concurred in" fails in the Committee of the
14 Whole, the obverse, i.e., a recommendation that the bill "do not pass" or "be not concurred in", is considered to
15 have passed. If a motion to recommend that a bill "do not pass" or "be not concurred in" fails in the Committee
16 of the Whole, the obverse, i.e., a recommendation that the bill "do pass" or "be concurred in", is considered to
17 have passed.
18 (5) An amendment attached to legislation by the Committee of the Whole remains unless removed by
19 further legislative action.

23 Whole by the next legislative day unless the House orders otherwise.

20 required vote is obtained.
21 (4) If the House rejects a conference committee report, the committee continues to exist unless
