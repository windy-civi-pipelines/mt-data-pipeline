16 Section 8. Section 46-23-509, MCA, is amended to read:
17 "46-23-509. Psychosexual evaluations and sexual offender designations. (1) Prior to sentencing
18 of a person convicted of a sexual offense, a sexual offender evaluator who has a license endorsement as
19 provided for in 37-1-139 shall provide the court with a psychosexual evaluation report recommending one of the
20 following levels of designation for the offender:
21 (a) level 1, the risk of a repeat sexual offense is low;
22 (b) level 2, the risk of a repeat sexual offense is moderate;
23 (c) level 3, the risk of a repeat sexual offense is high, there is a threat to public safety, and the
24 sexual offender evaluator believes that the offender is a sexually violent predator.
25 (2) Upon sentencing the offender, the court shall:
26 (a) review the psychosexual evaluation report, any statement by a victim, and any statement by
27 the offender;
28 (b) designate the offender as level 1, 2, or 3; and
- 14 - LC 232

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 0232
1 (c) designate a level 3 offender as a sexually violent predator.
2 (3) An offender designated as a level 2 offender or given a level designation by another state, the
3 federal government, or the department under subsection (5) that is determined by the court to be similar to level
4 2 may petition the sentencing court or the district court for the judicial district in which the offender resides to
5 change the offender's designation if the offender has enrolled in and successfully completed the treatment
6 phase of either the prison's sexual offender treatment program or of an equivalent program approved by the
7 department. After considering the petition, the court may change the offender's risk level designation if the court
8 finds by clear and convincing evidence that the offender's risk of committing a repeat sexual offense has
9 changed since the time sentence was imposed. The court shall impose one of the three risk levels specified in
10 this section.
11 (4) If, at the time of sentencing, the sentencing judge did not apply a level designation to a sexual
12 offender who is required to register under this part and who was sentenced prior to October 1, 1997, the
13 department shall designate the offender as level 1, 2, or 3 when the offender is released from confinement.
14 (5) If an offense is covered by 46-23-502 (10)(a)(xvii) 46-23-502(10)(a)(xviii), the offender registers
15 under 46-23-504(1)(c), and the offender was given a risk level designation after conviction by another state or
16 the federal government, the department of justice may give the offender the risk level designation assigned by
17 the other state or the federal government. All offenders convicted in another state or by the federal government
18 who are not currently under the supervision of the department or the youth court and were not given a risk level
19 designation after conviction shall provide to the department of justice all prior risk assessments and
20 psychosexual evaluations done to evaluate the offender's risk to reoffend. Any offender without a risk
21 assessment or psychosexual evaluation shall, at the offender's expense, undergo a psychosexual evaluation
22 with a sexual offender evaluator who has a license endorsement as provided for in 37-1-139. The results of the
23 psychosexual evaluation may be requested by the attorney general or a county attorney for purposes of
24 petitioning a district court to assign a risk level designation.
25 (6) The lack of a fixed residence is a factor that may be considered by the sentencing court or by
26 the department in determining the risk level to be assigned to an offender pursuant to this section.
27 (7) Upon obtaining information that indicates that a sexual offender who is required to register
28 under this part does not have a level 1, 2, or 3 designation, the offender, the attorney general, the county

69th Legislature 2025 LC 0232
1 attorney that prosecuted the offender and obtained a conviction for a sexual offense, or the county attorney for
2 the county in which the offender resides may, at any time, petition the district court that sentenced the offender
3 for a sexual offense or the district court for the judicial district in which the offender resides to designate the
4 offender as level 1, 2, or 3. Upon the filing of the petition, the court may order a psychosexual evaluation report
5 at the petitioner's expense, or order that the results of all prior psychosexual evaluations be provided to all
6 parties. The court shall provide the offender with an opportunity for a hearing prior to designating the offender.
7 The petitioner shall provide the offender, the attorney general, and the county attorney that prosecuted the
8 offender with notice of the petition and notice of the hearing. As provided in 46-23-506(2)(d), petitions for relief
9 from registration under this part must be filed in the appropriate Montana district court. Orders or other
10 documents granting relief from registration requirements that originated in other jurisdictions are not valid in
11 Montana."
