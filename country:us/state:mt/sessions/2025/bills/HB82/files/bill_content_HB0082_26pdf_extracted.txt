25 of a person convicted of a sexual offense, a sexual offender evaluator who has a license endorsement as
26 provided for in 37-1-139 shall provide the court with a psychosexual evaluation report recommending one of the
27 following levels of designation for the offender:
28 (a) level 1, the risk of a repeat sexual offense is low;
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 82

4 (2) Upon sentencing the offender, the court shall:
5 (a) review the psychosexual evaluation report, any statement by a victim, and any statement by
6 the offender;
7 (b) designate the offender as level 1, 2, or 3; and
8 (c) designate a level 3 offender as a sexually violent predator.
9 (3) An offender designated as a level 2 offender or given a level designation by another state, the
10 federal government, or the department under subsection (5) that is determined by the court to be similar to level
11 2 may petition the sentencing court or the district court for the judicial district in which the offender resides to
12 change the offender's designation if the offender has enrolled in and successfully completed the treatment
13 phase of either the prison's sexual offender treatment program or of an equivalent program approved by the
14 department. After considering the petition, the court may change the offender's risk level designation if the court
15 finds by clear and convincing evidence that the offender's risk of committing a repeat sexual offense has
16 changed since the time sentence was imposed. The court shall impose one of the three risk levels specified in
17 this section.
18 (4) If, at the time of sentencing, the sentencing judge did not apply a level designation to a sexual
19 offender who is required to register under this part and who was sentenced prior to October 1, 1997, the
20 department shall designate the offender as level 1, 2, or 3 when the offender is released from confinement.
21 (5) If an offense is covered by 46-23-502(10)(a)(xvii) 46-23-502(10)(a)(xviii), the offender registers
22 under 46-23-504(1)(c), and the offender was given a risk level designation after conviction by another state or
23 the federal government, the department of justice may give the offender the risk level designation assigned by
24 the other state or the federal government. All offenders convicted in another state or by the federal government
25 who are not currently under the supervision of the department or the youth court and were not given a risk level
26 designation after conviction shall provide to the department of justice all prior risk assessments and
27 psychosexual evaluations done to evaluate the offender's risk to reoffend. Any offender without a risk
28 assessment or psychosexual evaluation shall, at the offender's expense, undergo a psychosexual evaluation

69th Legislature 2025 HB0082.2

2 psychosexual evaluation may be requested by the attorney general or a county attorney for purposes of
3 petitioning a district court to assign a risk level designation.
4 (6) The lack of a fixed residence is a factor that may be considered by the sentencing court or by
5 the department in determining the risk level to be assigned to an offender pursuant to this section.
6 (7) Upon obtaining information that indicates that a sexual offender who is required to register
7 under this part does not have a level 1, 2, or 3 designation, the offender, the attorney general, the county
8 attorney that prosecuted the offender and obtained a conviction for a sexual offense, or the county attorney for
9 the county in which the offender resides may, at any time, petition the district court that sentenced the offender
10 for a sexual offense or the district court for the judicial district in which the offender resides to designate the
11 offender as level 1, 2, or 3. Upon the filing of the petition, the court may order a psychosexual evaluation report
12 at the petitioner's expense, or order that the results of all prior psychosexual evaluations be provided to all
13 parties. The court shall provide the offender with an opportunity for a hearing prior to designating the offender.
14 The petitioner shall provide the offender, the attorney general, and the county attorney that prosecuted the
15 offender with notice of the petition and notice of the hearing. As provided in 46-23-506(2)(d), petitions for relief
16 from registration under this part must be filed in the appropriate Montana district court. Orders or other
17 documents granting relief from registration requirements that originated in other jurisdictions are not valid in

11 2 may petition the sentencing court or the district court for the judicial district in which the offender resides to
12 change the offender's designation if the offender has enrolled in and successfully completed the treatment
13 phase of either the prison's sexual offender treatment program or of an equivalent program approved by the
14 department. After considering the petition, the court may change the offender's risk level designation if the court
15 finds by clear and convincing evidence that the offender's risk of committing a repeat sexual offense has
16 changed since the time sentence was imposed. The court shall impose one of the three risk levels specified in
17 this section.
18 (4) If, at the time of sentencing, the sentencing judge did not apply a level designation to a sexual
19 offender who is required to register under this part and who was sentenced prior to October 1, 1997, the

25 who are not currently under the supervision of the department or the youth court and were not given a risk level
26 designation after conviction shall provide to the department of justice all prior risk assessments and

2 psychosexual evaluation may be requested by the attorney general or a county attorney for purposes of
3 petitioning a district court to assign a risk level designation.
4 (6) The lack of a fixed residence is a factor that may be considered by the sentencing court or by
5 the department in determining the risk level to be assigned to an offender pursuant to this section.
6 (7) Upon obtaining information that indicates that a sexual offender who is required to register
7 under this part does not have a level 1, 2, or 3 designation, the offender, the attorney general, the county
8 attorney that prosecuted the offender and obtained a conviction for a sexual offense, or the county attorney for
9 the county in which the offender resides may, at any time, petition the district court that sentenced the offender
10 for a sexual offense or the district court for the judicial district in which the offender resides to designate the
11 offender as level 1, 2, or 3. Upon the filing of the petition, the court may order a psychosexual evaluation report
12 at the petitioner's expense, or order that the results of all prior psychosexual evaluations be provided to all
13 parties. The court shall provide the offender with an opportunity for a hearing prior to designating the offender.
14 The petitioner shall provide the offender, the attorney general, and the county attorney that prosecuted the
15 offender with notice of the petition and notice of the hearing. As provided in 46-23-506(2)(d), petitions for relief
