21 changes and an estimated budget impact to the department over the next 4 fiscal years.

23 department may set priorities to limit, reduce, or otherwise curtail the amount, scope, or duration of the medical
24 services made available under the Montana medicaid program after taking into consideration the funding
25 principles set forth in subsection (2). (Subsection (3)(o) terminates September 30, 2025--sec. 1, Ch. 298, L.
