25 from Montana medicaid for services provided to individuals of different ages, diagnoses, and treatments.
26 (9) The services provided under this part may be only those that are medically necessary and that
27 are the most efficient and cost-effective.

15 department may set priorities to limit, reduce, or otherwise curtail the amount, scope, or duration of the medical
16 services made available under the Montana medicaid program after taking into consideration the funding
17 principles set forth in subsection (2). (Subsection (3)(o) terminates September 30, 2025--sec. 1, Ch. 298, L.
