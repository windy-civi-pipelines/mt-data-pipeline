1 "75-2-203. Department to set emission levels. (1) The Subject to subsection (2), the department
2 may establish the limitations of the levels, concentrations, or quantities of emissions of various pollutants from
3 any source necessary to prevent, abate, or control air pollution. Except as otherwise provided in or pursuant to
4 this section, those levels, concentrations, or quantities are controlling, and no emission in excess of those
5 levels is lawful.
6 (2) (a) In any area where the concentration of air pollution sources or of population or where the
7 nature of the economy or of land and its uses may require, Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), the
8 department may not fix more stringent requirements governing the emission of air pollutants than those in effect
9 pursuant to subsection (1) the federal standards or limitations established in the federal Clean Air Act for the
10 emission of regulated pollutants.
11 (b) Subsection (2)(a) does not apply to requirements:
12 (i) governing the emissions of air pollutants established prior to [the effective date of this act]; and
13 (ii) necessary in areas classified as nonattainment, or maintenance, or to prevent nonattainment,
14 as approved by the department, to comply with national ambient air quality standards as required in the federal
15 Clean Air Act.
16 (3) The department may by rule use any widely recognized measuring system for measuring
17 emission of air contaminants.

1 comparable federal regulations or guidelines only if:
2 (i) a public hearing is held;
3 (ii) public comment is allowed; and
4 (iii) the department makes a written finding after the public hearing and comment period that is
5 based on evidence in the record that the proposed standard or requirement:
6 (A) protects public health or the environment;
7 (B) can mitigate harm to the public health or the environment; and
8 (C) is achievable with current technology.
9 (b) The written finding required under subsection (2)(a)(iii) must reference information and peer-
10 reviewed scientific studies contained in the record that form the basis for the department's conclusion. The
11 written finding must also include information from the hearing record regarding costs to the regulated
12 community that are directly attributable to the proposed standard or requirement.
13 (c) (i) A person or entity affected by a rule of the department adopted after January 1, 1990, and

16 (ii) If the department determines that the rule is more stringent than comparable federal
17 regulations or guidelines, the department shall either revise the rule to conform to the federal regulations or
18 guidelines or follow the process provided in subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b) within a reasonable period of time, not
19 to exceed 6 months after receiving the petition.
20 (iii) A petition under this section does not relieve the petitioner of the duty to comply with the
21 challenged rule. The department may charge a petition filing fee in an amount not to exceed $250.
22 (iv) A person may also petition the department for a rule review under subsection (2)(a) if the
23 department adopts a rule after January 1, 1990, in an area in which no federal regulations or guidelines existed
24 and the federal government subsequently establishes comparable regulations or guidelines that are less
25 stringent than the previously adopted department rule.
26 (3)(2) This section does not apply to a rule adopted under the emergency rulemaking provisions of 2-

2 Section 4. Section 75-2-301, MCA, is amended to read:
3 "75-2-301. Local air pollution control programs -- consistency with state and federal
4 regulations -- procedure for public notice and comment required. (1) After public hearing, a municipality or
5 county may establish and administer a local air pollution control program if the program is consistent with this
6 chapter and is approved by the department.
7 (2) If a local air pollution control program established by a county encompasses all or part of a
8 municipality, the county and each municipality shall approve the program in accordance with subsection (1).
9 (3) (a) Except as provided in subsection (5) (4), the department by order may approve a local air
10 pollution control program that:
11 (i)(a) subject to subsection (4), provides by rule, ordinance, or local law for requirements compatible
12 with, more stringent than, or more extensive than those imposed by 75-2-203, 75-2-204, 75-2-211, 75-2-212,
13 75-2-215, 75-2-217 through 75-2-219, and 75-2-402 and rules adopted under these sections;

15 appropriate administrative and judicial processes; and
16 (iii)(c) provides for administrative organization, staff, financial resources, and other resources
17 necessary to effectively and efficiently carry out the program. As part of meeting these requirements, a local air
18 pollution control program may administer the permit or registration fee provisions of 75-2-220. The permit or
19 registration fees collected by a local air pollution control program must be deposited in a county special revenue
20 fund to be used by the local air pollution control program for administration of local air pollution control program
21 permitting or registration activities.
22 (b) Department approval of a rule, ordinance, or local law that is more stringent than the
23 comparable state law is subject to the provisions of subsection (4).
24 (4) (a) A local air pollution control program may, subject to approval by the department, adopt a
25 rule, ordinance, or local law to implement this chapter that is more stringent than comparable state or federal
26 regulations or guidelines only if:

1 (ii) public comment is allowed; and
2 (iii) the department or the local air pollution control program makes a written finding after the public
3 hearing and comment period that is based on evidence in the record that the proposed local standard or
4 requirement:
5 (A) protects public health or the environment of the area;
6 (B) can mitigate harm to the public health or the environment; and
7 (C) is achievable with current technology.
8 (b) The written finding required under subsection (4)(a)(iii) must reference information and peer-
9 reviewed scientific studies contained in the record that form the basis for the department's or the local air
10 pollution control program's conclusion. The written finding must also include information from the hearing record
11 regarding costs to the regulated community that are directly attributable to the proposed local standard or
12 requirement.
13 (c) (i) A person or entity affected by a rule, ordinance, or local law approved or adopted after
14 January 1, 1996, and before May 1, 2001, that the person or entity believes is more stringent than comparable
15 state or federal regulations or guidelines may petition the department or the local air pollution control program
16 to review the rule, ordinance, or local law.
17 (ii) If the department or local air pollution control program determines that the rule, ordinance, or
18 local law is more stringent than state or federal regulations or guidelines, the department or local air pollution
19 control program shall either revise the rule, ordinance, or local law to conform to the state or federal regulations
20 or guidelines or follow the process provided in subsections (4)(a) and (4)(b) within a reasonable period of time,
21 not to exceed 6 months after receiving the petition.
22 (5)(4) Except for those emergency powers provided for in 75-2-402, the department may not delegate
23 to a local air pollution control program the authority to control any air pollutant source that:
24 (a) requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement in accordance with Title 75,
25 chapter 1, part 2;
26 (b) is subject to regulation under the Montana Major Facility Siting Act, as provided in Title 75,
27 chapter 20; or

1 (c) has the potential to emit 250 tons a year or more of any pollutant subject to regulation under
2 this chapter, including fugitive emissions, unless the authority to control the source was delegated to a local air
3 pollution control program prior to January 1, 1991.
4 (6)(5) If the department finds that the location, character, or extent of particular concentrations of
5 population, air pollutant sources, or geographic, topographic, or meteorological considerations or any
6 combination of these makes impracticable the maintenance of appropriate levels of air quality without an
7 areawide air pollution control program, the department may determine the boundaries within which the program
8 is necessary and require it as the only acceptable alternative to direct state administration.
9 (7)(6) If the department has reason to believe that any part of an air pollution control program in force
10 under this section is either inadequate to prevent and control air pollution in the jurisdiction to which the
11 program relates or is being administered in a manner inconsistent with this chapter, the department shall, on
12 notice, conduct a hearing on the matter.
13 (8)(7) If, after the hearing, the department determines that any part of the program is inadequate to
14 prevent and control air pollution in the jurisdiction to which it relates or that it is not accomplishing the purposes
15 of this chapter, it shall require that necessary corrective measures be taken within a reasonable time, not to
16 exceed 60 days.
17 (9)(8) If the jurisdiction fails to take these measures within the time required, the department shall
18 administer within that jurisdiction all of the provisions of this chapter, including the terms contained in any
19 applicable department order, that are necessary to correct the deficiencies found by the department. The
20 department's control program supersedes all municipal or county air pollution laws, rules, ordinances, and
21 requirements in the affected jurisdiction. The cost of the department's action is a charge on the jurisdiction.
22 (10)(9) If the department finds that the control of a particular air pollutant source because of its
23 complexity or magnitude is beyond the reasonable capability of the local jurisdiction or may be more efficiently
24 and economically performed at the state level, it may assume and retain control over that air pollutant source. A
25 charge may not be assessed against the jurisdiction. Findings made under this subsection may be either on the
26 basis of the nature of the sources involved or on the basis of their relationship to the size of the communities in
27 which they are located.
