4 reviewed scientific studies contained in the record that form the basis for the department's or the local air
5 pollution control program's conclusion. The written finding must also include information from the hearing record
6 regarding costs to the regulated community that are directly attributable to the proposed local standard or
7 requirement.
8 (c) (i) A person or entity affected by a rule, ordinance, or local law approved or adopted after
9 January 1, 1996, and before May 1, 2001, that the person or entity believes is more stringent than comparable
10 state or federal regulations or guidelines may petition the department or the local air pollution control program
11 to review the rule, ordinance, or local law.
12 (ii) If the department or local air pollution control program determines that the rule, ordinance, or
13 local law is more stringent than state or federal regulations or guidelines, the department or local air pollution
14 control program shall either revise the rule, ordinance, or local law to conform to the state or federal regulations

25 pollution control program prior to January 1, 1991.
26 (6)(5) If the department finds that the location, character, or extent of particular concentrations of
27 population, air pollutant sources, or geographic, topographic, or meteorological considerations or any
28 combination of these makes impracticable the maintenance of appropriate levels of air quality without an

69th Legislature 2025 HB 291.1
1 areawide air pollution control program, the department may determine the boundaries within which the program
2 is necessary and require it as the only acceptable alternative to direct state administration.
3 (7)(6) If the department has reason to believe that any part of an air pollution control program in force
4 under this section is either inadequate to prevent and control air pollution in the jurisdiction to which the
5 program relates or is being administered in a manner inconsistent with this chapter, the department shall, on
6 notice, conduct a hearing on the matter.
7 (8)(7) If, after the hearing, the department determines that any part of the program is inadequate to
8 prevent and control air pollution in the jurisdiction to which it relates or that it is not accomplishing the purposes
9 of this chapter, it shall require that necessary corrective measures be taken within a reasonable time, not to
10 exceed 60 days.
11 (9)(8) If the jurisdiction fails to take these measures within the time required, the department shall
12 administer within that jurisdiction all of the provisions of this chapter, including the terms contained in any
13 applicable department order, that are necessary to correct the deficiencies found by the department. The
14 department's control program supersedes all municipal or county air pollution laws, rules, ordinances, and
15 requirements in the affected jurisdiction. The cost of the department's action is a charge on the jurisdiction.
16 (10)(9) If the department finds that the control of a particular air pollutant source because of its
17 complexity or magnitude is beyond the reasonable capability of the local jurisdiction or may be more efficiently
18 and economically performed at the state level, it may assume and retain control over that air pollutant source. A
19 charge may not be assessed against the jurisdiction. Findings made under this subsection may be either on the
20 basis of the nature of the sources involved or on the basis of their relationship to the size of the communities in
21 which they are located.
22 (11)(10) A jurisdiction in which the department administers all or part of its air pollution control
23 program under subsection (9) (8) may establish or resume an air pollution control program that meets the
24 requirements of subsection (3).
25 (12)(11) A municipality or county may administer all or part of its air pollution control program in
26 cooperation with one or more municipalities or counties of this state or of other states.
27 (13)(12) Local air pollution control programs established under this section shall provide
28 procedures for public notice, public hearing, public comment, and appeal for any proposed new or revised

21 regulations or guidelines; and
22 (C) be written in plain, easily understood language.
23 (d) For the purposes of subsection (13)(c)(v) (12)(c)(v), a statement of authority to adopt a rule,
24 ordinance, or local law does not, standing alone, constitute a showing of reasonable necessity for the intended
25 action.
26 (e) The local air pollution control program shall mail a copy of the proposed rule, ordinance, or
27 local law to all interested persons on the list established pursuant to subsection (13)(a) (12)(a) who have made
28 timely requests to be included on the list.

6 regarding costs to the regulated community that are directly attributable to the proposed local standard or
7 requirement.
8 (c) (i) A person or entity affected by a rule, ordinance, or local law approved or adopted after
9 January 1, 1996, and before May 1, 2001, that the person or entity believes is more stringent than comparable
10 state or federal regulations or guidelines may petition the department or the local air pollution control program
11 to review the rule, ordinance, or local law.
12 (ii) If the department or local air pollution control program determines that the rule, ordinance, or
13 local law is more stringent than state or federal regulations or guidelines, the department or local air pollution
14 control program shall either revise the rule, ordinance, or local law to conform to the state or federal regulations
15 or guidelines or follow the process provided in subsections (4)(a) and (4)(b) within a reasonable period of time,
16 not to exceed 6 months after receiving the petition.
17 (5)(4) Except for those emergency powers provided for in 75-2-402, the department may not delegate
18 to a local air pollution control program the authority to control any air pollutant source that:
19 (a) requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement in accordance with Title 75,
20 chapter 1, part 2;
21 (b) is subject to regulation under the Montana Major Facility Siting Act, as provided in Title 75,
22 chapter 20; or
23 (c) has the potential to emit 250 tons a year or more of any pollutant subject to regulation under
24 this chapter, including fugitive emissions, unless the authority to control the source was delegated to a local air
25 pollution control program prior to January 1, 1991.
26 (6)(5) If the department finds that the location, character, or extent of particular concentrations of
27 population, air pollutant sources, or geographic, topographic, or meteorological considerations or any
28 combination of these makes impracticable the maintenance of appropriate levels of air quality without an

1 areawide air pollution control program, the department may determine the boundaries within which the program
2 is necessary and require it as the only acceptable alternative to direct state administration.
3 (7)(6) If the department has reason to believe that any part of an air pollution control program in force
4 under this section is either inadequate to prevent and control air pollution in the jurisdiction to which the
5 program relates or is being administered in a manner inconsistent with this chapter, the department shall, on
6 notice, conduct a hearing on the matter.
7 (8)(7) If, after the hearing, the department determines that any part of the program is inadequate to
8 prevent and control air pollution in the jurisdiction to which it relates or that it is not accomplishing the purposes
9 of this chapter, it shall require that necessary corrective measures be taken within a reasonable time, not to
10 exceed 60 days.
11 (9)(8) If the jurisdiction fails to take these measures within the time required, the department shall
12 administer within that jurisdiction all of the provisions of this chapter, including the terms contained in any
13 applicable department order, that are necessary to correct the deficiencies found by the department. The
14 department's control program supersedes all municipal or county air pollution laws, rules, ordinances, and
15 requirements in the affected jurisdiction. The cost of the department's action is a charge on the jurisdiction.
16 (10)(9) If the department finds that the control of a particular air pollutant source because of its
17 complexity or magnitude is beyond the reasonable capability of the local jurisdiction or may be more efficiently
18 and economically performed at the state level, it may assume and retain control over that air pollutant source. A
19 charge may not be assessed against the jurisdiction. Findings made under this subsection may be either on the
20 basis of the nature of the sources involved or on the basis of their relationship to the size of the communities in
21 which they are located.
22 (11)(10) A jurisdiction in which the department administers all or part of its air pollution control
23 program under subsection (9) (8) may establish or resume an air pollution control program that meets the
24 requirements of subsection (3).
25 (12)(11) A municipality or county may administer all or part of its air pollution control program in
26 cooperation with one or more municipalities or counties of this state or of other states.
27 (13)(12) Local air pollution control programs established under this section shall provide
28 procedures for public notice, public hearing, public comment, and appeal for any proposed new or revised

1 rules, ordinances, or local laws adopted pursuant to this section. The procedures must comply with the
2 following requirements:
3 (a) The local air pollution control program shall create and maintain a list of interested persons who
4 wish to be informed of actions related to rules, ordinances, or local laws adopted by the local air pollution
5 control program.
6 (b) At least 30 days prior to the adoption, revision, or repeal of a rule, ordinance, or law, the local
7 air pollution control program shall give written notice of its intended action.
8 (c) The notice required under subsection (13)(b) (12)(b) must include:
9 (i) a statement of the terms or substance of the intended action or a description of the subjects
10 and issues affected by the intended action;
11 (ii) an explanation of the procedure for a person to be included on the list of interested persons
12 established pursuant to subsection (13)(a) (12)(a);
13 (iii) an explanation of the procedures and deadlines for presentation of oral or written comments
14 related to the intended action;
15 (iv) an explanation of the process for requesting a public hearing as provided in subsection (13)(f)
16 (12)(f); and
17 (v) the rationale for the intended action. The rationale must:
18 (A) include an explanation of why the intended action is reasonably necessary to implement the
19 goals and purposes of the local air pollution control program;
20 (B) specifically address those intended actions for which there are no similar state or federal
21 regulations or guidelines; and
22 (C) be written in plain, easily understood language.
23 (d) For the purposes of subsection (13)(c)(v) (12)(c)(v), a statement of authority to adopt a rule,
24 ordinance, or local law does not, standing alone, constitute a showing of reasonable necessity for the intended
25 action.
26 (e) The local air pollution control program shall mail a copy of the proposed rule, ordinance, or
27 local law to all interested persons on the list established pursuant to subsection (13)(a) (12)(a) who have made
28 timely requests to be included on the list.
