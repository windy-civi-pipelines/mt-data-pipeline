1 pollution control program that:
2 (a) subject to subsection (4), provides by rule, ordinance, or local law for requirements compatible
3 with, more stringent than, or more extensive than those imposed by 75-2-203, 75-2-204, 75-2-211, 75-2-212,

6 appropriate administrative and judicial processes; and
7 (c) provides for administrative organization, staff, financial resources, and other resources
8 necessary to effectively and efficiently carry out the program. As part of meeting these requirements, a local air
9 pollution control program may administer the permit or registration fee provisions of 75-2-220. The permit or
10 registration fees collected by a local air pollution control program must be deposited in a county special revenue
11 fund to be used by the local air pollution control program for administration of local air pollution control program
12 permitting or registration activities.
13 (b) Department approval of a rule, ordinance, or local law that is more stringent than the
14 comparable state law is subject to the provisions of subsection (4).

19 (ii) public comment is allowed; and
20 (iii) the department or the local air pollution control program makes a written finding after the public
21 hearing and comment period that is based on evidence in the record that the proposed local standard or
22 requirement:
23 (A) protects public health or the environment of the area;
24 (B) can mitigate harm to the public health or the environment; and
25 (C) is achievable with current technology.
26 (b) The written finding required under subsection (4)(a)(iii) must reference information and peer-
27 reviewed scientific studies contained in the record that form the basis for the department's or the local air
28 pollution control program's conclusion. The written finding must also include information from the hearing record

69th Legislature 2025 LC 2990
1 regarding costs to the regulated community that are directly attributable to the proposed local standard or
2 requirement.
3 (c) (i) A person or entity affected by a rule, ordinance, or local law approved or adopted after
4 January 1, 1996, and before May 1, 2001, that the person or entity believes is more stringent than comparable
5 state or federal regulations or guidelines may petition the department or the local air pollution control program
6 to review the rule, ordinance, or local law.
7 (ii) If the department or local air pollution control program determines that the rule, ordinance, or
8 local law is more stringent than state or federal regulations or guidelines, the department or local air pollution
9 control program shall either revise the rule, ordinance, or local law to conform to the state or federal regulations
10 or guidelines or follow the process provided in subsections (4)(a) and (4)(b) within a reasonable period of time,
11 not to exceed 6 months after receiving the petition.
12 (4) Except for those emergency powers provided for in 75-2-402, the department may not delegate
13 to a local air pollution control program the authority to control any air pollutant source that:
14 (a) requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement in accordance with Title 75,
15 chapter 1, part 2;
16 (b) is subject to regulation under the Montana Major Facility Siting Act, as provided in Title 75,
17 chapter 20; or
18 (c) has the potential to emit 250 tons a year or more of any pollutant subject to regulation under
19 this chapter, including fugitive emissions, unless the authority to control the source was delegated to a local air
20 pollution control program prior to January 1, 1991.
21 (5) If the department finds that the location, character, or extent of particular concentrations of
22 population, air pollutant sources, or geographic, topographic, or meteorological considerations or any
23 combination of these makes impracticable the maintenance of appropriate levels of air quality without an
24 areawide air pollution control program, the department may determine the boundaries within which the program
25 is necessary and require it as the only acceptable alternative to direct state administration.
26 (6) If the department has reason to believe that any part of an air pollution control program in force
27 under this section is either inadequate to prevent and control air pollution in the jurisdiction to which the
28 program relates or is being administered in a manner inconsistent with this chapter, the department shall, on
- 5 - LC 2990

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2990
1 notice, conduct a hearing on the matter.
2 (7) If, after the hearing, the department determines that any part of the program is inadequate to
3 prevent and control air pollution in the jurisdiction to which it relates or that it is not accomplishing the purposes
4 of this chapter, it shall require that necessary corrective measures be taken within a reasonable time, not to
5 exceed 60 days.
6 (8) If the jurisdiction fails to take these measures within the time required, the department shall
7 administer within that jurisdiction all of the provisions of this chapter, including the terms contained in any
8 applicable department order, that are necessary to correct the deficiencies found by the department. The
9 department's control program supersedes all municipal or county air pollution laws, rules, ordinances, and
10 requirements in the affected jurisdiction. The cost of the department's action is a charge on the jurisdiction.
11 (9) If the department finds that the control of a particular air pollutant source because of its
12 complexity or magnitude is beyond the reasonable capability of the local jurisdiction or may be more efficiently
13 and economically performed at the state level, it may assume and retain control over that air pollutant source. A
14 charge may not be assessed against the jurisdiction. Findings made under this subsection may be either on the
15 basis of the nature of the sources involved or on the basis of their relationship to the size of the communities in
16 which they are located.
17 (10) A jurisdiction in which the department administers all or part of its air pollution control
18 program under subsection (9) (8) may establish or resume an air pollution control program that meets the
19 requirements of subsection (3).
20 (11) A municipality or county may administer all or part of its air pollution control program in
21 cooperation with one or more municipalities or counties of this state or of other states.
22 (12) Local air pollution control programs established under this section shall provide
23 procedures for public notice, public hearing, public comment, and appeal for any proposed new or revised
24 rules, ordinances, or local laws adopted pursuant to this section. The procedures must comply with the
25 following requirements:
26 (a) The local air pollution control program shall create and maintain a list of interested persons who
27 wish to be informed of actions related to rules, ordinances, or local laws adopted by the local air pollution
28 control program.

1 (b) At least 30 days prior to the adoption, revision, or repeal of a rule, ordinance, or law, the local
2 air pollution control program shall give written notice of its intended action.
3 (c) The notice required under subsection (13)(b) (12)(b) must include:
4 (i) a statement of the terms or substance of the intended action or a description of the subjects
5 and issues affected by the intended action;
6 (ii) an explanation of the procedure for a person to be included on the list of interested persons
7 established pursuant to subsection (13)(a) (12)(a);
8 (iii) an explanation of the procedures and deadlines for presentation of oral or written comments
9 related to the intended action;
10 (iv) an explanation of the process for requesting a public hearing as provided in subsection (13)(f)
11 (12)(f); and
12 (v) the rationale for the intended action. The rationale must:
13 (A) include an explanation of why the intended action is reasonably necessary to implement the
14 goals and purposes of the local air pollution control program;
15 (B) specifically address those intended actions for which there are no similar state or federal
16 regulations or guidelines; and
17 (C) be written in plain, easily understood language.
18 (d) For the purposes of subsection (13)(c)(v) (12)(c)(v), a statement of authority to adopt a rule,
19 ordinance, or local law does not, standing alone, constitute a showing of reasonable necessity for the intended
20 action.
21 (e) The local air pollution control program shall mail a copy of the proposed rule, ordinance, or
22 local law to all interested persons on the list established pursuant to subsection (13)(a) (12)(a) who have made
23 timely requests to be included on the list.
24 (f) If at least 10 of the persons who will be directly affected by the proposed rule, ordinance, or
25 local law request a public hearing, the local air pollution control program shall hold a hearing to hear comments
26 from the public on the intended action.
27 (g) The local air pollution control program shall prepare a written response to all comments
28 submitted in writing or presented at the public hearing for consideration prior to adoption, revision, or repeal of
