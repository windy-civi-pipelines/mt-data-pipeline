4 providers while the resident lives at the facility;
5 (b) standards to be used by a facility and, if appropriate, by a screening agency to screen
6 residents and prospective residents to prevent residence by individuals referred to in subsections (3) through
7 (5). An individual subject to 46-14-301 is not eligible to be placed in a category D assisted living facility.

9 under subsection (8)(b) may be appealed by the facility operator or by or on behalf of a resident or prospective
10 resident;

12 structural, environmental, sanitary, infection control, dietary, social, staffing, and recordkeeping components of
13 a facility and the storage and administration of over-the-counter and prescription medications;
14 (e) standards for operating a category B assisted living facility, which must include the standards

23 Section 2. Section 53-21-127, MCA, is amended to read:
24 "53-21-127. (Temporary) Posttrial disposition. (1) If, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent
25 is not suffering from a mental disorder or does not require commitment within the meaning of this part, the
26 respondent must be discharged and the petition dismissed.
27 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
28 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition

69th Legislature 2025 SB 524.1
1 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
2 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
3 respondent.
4 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
5 the court shall:
6 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
7 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
8 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
9 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
10 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
11 (i) not more than 3 months; or
12 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
13 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
14 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
15 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
16 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
17 in 53-21-190; or
18 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
19 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
20 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
21 established in administrative rules of the department; and
22 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
23 for admission.
24 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
25 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
26 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
27 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
28 treatment.

69th Legislature 2025 SB 524.1
1 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
2 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
3 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
4 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
5 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
6 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
7 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
8 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
9 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
10 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
11 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
12 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
13 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
14 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
15 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
16 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
17 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may
18 require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living facility, or a
19 program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and may not require
20 commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health nursing
21 care center.
22 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
23 fact:
24 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
25 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
26 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
27 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
28 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 524.1
1 respondent;
2 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
3 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
4 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
5 chosen from among other alternatives;
6 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
7 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
8 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
9 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
10 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
11 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
12 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
13 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
14 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
15 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
16 from among other alternatives.
17 53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and
18 the petition dismissed if, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent:
19 (a) is not suffering from a mental disorder;
20 (b) does not require commitment within the meaning of this part; or
21 (c) is suffering from a mental disorder but the respondent's primary diagnosis is Alzheimer's
22 disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
23 criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).
24 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
25 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
26 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
27 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
28 respondent.

69th Legislature 2025 SB 524.1
1 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
2 the court shall:
3 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
4 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
5 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
6 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
7 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
8 (i) not more than 3 months; or
9 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
10 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent is committed to a
11 category D assisted living facility as provided in 53-21-199 or if a respondent has been previously involuntarily
12 committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines that the admission of
13 evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of predictability, as provided in 53-
14 21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided in 53-21-190; or
15 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
16 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
17 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
18 established in administrative rules of the department; and
19 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
20 for admission.
21 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
22 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
23 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
24 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
25 treatment.
26 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
27 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
28 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be

1 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
2 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
3 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
4 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
5 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
6 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
7 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
8 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
9 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
10 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
11 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
12 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
13 (7) Except as provided in 53-21-126(7), satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1)
14 justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter. However, if the court relies solely on the criterion provided in 53-
15 21-126(1)(d), the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D
16 assisted living facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and
17 may not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental
18 health nursing care center.
19 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
20 fact:
21 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
22 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
23 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;

15 Section 3. Section 53-21-199, MCA, is amended to read:
16 "53-21-199. Option for diversion from involuntary commitment to Montana state hospital --
17 diversion to category D assisted living facilities. (1) It is the intent of the legislature to divert individuals from
18 all forms of involuntary commitment. When it is not possible to divert an individual from involuntary commitment,
19 it is the intent of the legislature that commitment to the Montana state hospital serves as a last resort because
20 the Montana state hospital is the most restrictive and least cost-effective form of mental health treatment in the
21 state.
22 (1) (2) Subject to subsection (3), a A person with a mental disorder who is detained or considered for
23 detention under 53-21-120(4) may, upon meeting the requirements in 50-5-226(5), request diversion be
24 diverted to a category D assisted living facility pursuant to the processes outlined in this section.
25 (3) A court may dismiss involuntary treatment proceedings to facilitate voluntary treatment at a
26 category D assisted living facility if:
27 (a) the court finds that a person detained or considered for detention under this chapter is likely to
28 benefit from the services of a category D assisted living facility;
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 524.1
1 (b) a category D assisted living facility is willing to serve the person; and
2 (c) the person is willing to receive services from the category D assisted living facility.
3 (2) (4) If voluntary diversion to a category D facility as provided in subsection (3) is not possible and a
4 court, after obtaining the results of an examination as provided in 53-21-123, finds that a short-term inpatient
5 treatment is inappropriate for a person who otherwise is eligible for involuntary commitment to the Montana
6 state hospital, the court may initiate the process necessary to determine eligibility for residency in to divert the
7 person from the Montana state hospital by ordering involuntary commitment to a category D assisted living
8 facility.
9 (3) (5) For a person to be eligible for diversion from the Montana state hospital to a category D
10 assisted living facility pursuant to subsection (4), a court determination and an examination under 53-21-123
11 must indicate that the person:
12 (a) is not suffering acute psychosis; meets the requirements of commitment;
13 (b) is experiencing behavioral patterns that may make the person a danger to self or others; meets
14 the eligibility requirements of 50-5-226; and
15 (c) is dependent on assistance for two or more activities of daily living; and has been approved for
16 admission by a category D assisted living facility.
17 (d) is more likely to benefit from being in a category D assisted living facility than in the Montana
18 mental health nursing care center or the Montana state hospital.
19 (6) (a) No later than 30 days before the end of a commitment period, the category D assisted living
20 facility that approved a person for admission may provide notice to the court that the facility is no longer able to
21 meet the treatment needs of the person committed to the facility's care.
22 (b) On receipt of the notice from a category D assisted living facility, the court shall initiate the
23 process to determine if the person continues to meet the requirements under subsection (5) for diversion to a
24 category D assisted living facility.
25 (c) If the person meets the requirements for commitment to a category D assisted living facility
26 under subsection (5), but no category D assisted living facility has approved the person for admission, the court
27 may commit the person to the Montana state hospital subject to the provisions of 53-21-127."

1 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
2 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
3 respondent.
4 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
5 the court shall:
6 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
7 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
8 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living

10 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
11 (i) not more than 3 months; or
12 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
13 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
14 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
15 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
16 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
17 in 53-21-190; or
18 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
19 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
20 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
21 established in administrative rules of the department; and
22 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
23 for admission.
24 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
25 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
26 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
27 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
28 treatment.

69th Legislature 2025 SB 524.1
1 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
2 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
3 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
4 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
5 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
6 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
7 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
8 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
9 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
10 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
11 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
12 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
13 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
14 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
15 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
16 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
17 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may
18 require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living facility, or a
19 program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and may not require
20 commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health nursing
21 care center.
22 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
23 fact:
24 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
25 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
26 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
27 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
28 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the

1 respondent;
2 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
3 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
4 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
5 chosen from among other alternatives;
6 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
7 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
8 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
9 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
10 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
11 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
12 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
13 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
14 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
15 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
16 from among other alternatives.
17 53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and
18 the petition dismissed if, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent:
19 (a) is not suffering from a mental disorder;
20 (b) does not require commitment within the meaning of this part; or
21 (c) is suffering from a mental disorder but the respondent's primary diagnosis is Alzheimer's
22 disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
23 criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).
24 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
25 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
26 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
27 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
28 respondent.

4 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;

8 (i) not more than 3 months; or
9 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
10 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent is committed to a
11 category D assisted living facility as provided in 53-21-199 or if a respondent has been previously involuntarily
12 committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines that the admission of
13 evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of predictability, as provided in 53-
14 21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided in 53-21-190; or

16 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:

22 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.

24 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
25 treatment.
26 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the

4 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication

10 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
11 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
12 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
13 (7) Except as provided in 53-21-126(7), satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1)
14 justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter. However, if the court relies solely on the criterion provided in 53-
15 21-126(1)(d), the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D
16 assisted living facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and
17 may not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental

15 Section 3. Section 53-21-199, MCA, is amended to read:
16 "53-21-199. Option for diversion from involuntary commitment to Montana state hospital --
17 diversion to category D assisted living facilities. (1) It is the intent of the legislature to divert individuals from
18 all forms of involuntary commitment. When it is not possible to divert an individual from involuntary commitment,
19 it is the intent of the legislature that commitment to the Montana state hospital serves as a last resort because
20 the Montana state hospital is the most restrictive and least cost-effective form of mental health treatment in the
21 state.
22 (1) (2) Subject to subsection (3), a A person with a mental disorder who is detained or considered for
23 detention under 53-21-120(4) may, upon meeting the requirements in 50-5-226(5), request diversion be
24 diverted to a category D assisted living facility pursuant to the processes outlined in this section.
25 (3) A court may dismiss involuntary treatment proceedings to facilitate voluntary treatment at a
26 category D assisted living facility if:
27 (a) the court finds that a person detained or considered for detention under this chapter is likely to
28 benefit from the services of a category D assisted living facility;
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 524.1
1 (b) a category D assisted living facility is willing to serve the person; and
2 (c) the person is willing to receive services from the category D assisted living facility.
3 (2) (4) If voluntary diversion to a category D facility as provided in subsection (3) is not possible and a
4 court, after obtaining the results of an examination as provided in 53-21-123, finds that a short-term inpatient
5 treatment is inappropriate for a person who otherwise is eligible for involuntary commitment to the Montana
6 state hospital, the court may initiate the process necessary to determine eligibility for residency in to divert the
7 person from the Montana state hospital by ordering involuntary commitment to a category D assisted living
8 facility.
9 (3) (5) For a person to be eligible for diversion from the Montana state hospital to a category D
10 assisted living facility pursuant to subsection (4), a court determination and an examination under 53-21-123
11 must indicate that the person:
12 (a) is not suffering acute psychosis; meets the requirements of commitment;
13 (b) is experiencing behavioral patterns that may make the person a danger to self or others; meets
14 the eligibility requirements of 50-5-226; and
15 (c) is dependent on assistance for two or more activities of daily living; and has been approved for
16 admission by a category D assisted living facility.
17 (d) is more likely to benefit from being in a category D assisted living facility than in the Montana
18 mental health nursing care center or the Montana state hospital.
19 (6) (a) No later than 30 days before the end of a commitment period, the category D assisted living
20 facility that approved a person for admission may provide notice to the court that the facility is no longer able to
21 meet the treatment needs of the person committed to the facility's care.
22 (b) On receipt of the notice from a category D assisted living facility, the court shall initiate the
23 process to determine if the person continues to meet the requirements under subsection (5) for diversion to a
24 category D assisted living facility.
25 (c) If the person meets the requirements for commitment to a category D assisted living facility
26 under subsection (5), but no category D assisted living facility has approved the person for admission, the court
