5 (i) physical and mental standards for residents of assisted living facilities;
6 (ii) requirements for placement in a facility with a higher standard of care if a resident's condition
7 deteriorates; and
8 (iii) the services offered by the facility and services that a resident may receive from third-party
9 providers while the resident lives at the facility;
10 (b) standards to be used by a facility and, if appropriate, by a screening agency to screen
11 residents and prospective residents to prevent residence by individuals referred to in subsections (3) through
12 (5). An individual subject to 46-14-301 is not eligible to be placed in a category D assisted living facility.
13 (c) a method by which the results of any screening decision made pursuant to rules established
14 under subsection (8)(b) may be appealed by the facility operator or by or on behalf of a resident or prospective
15 resident;
16 (d) standards for operating a category A assisted living facility, including standards for the physical,
17 structural, environmental, sanitary, infection control, dietary, social, staffing, and recordkeeping components of
18 a facility and the storage and administration of over-the-counter and prescription medications;
19 (e) standards for operating a category B assisted living facility, which must include the standards
20 for a category A assisted living facility and additional standards for assessment of residents, care planning,
21 qualifications and training of staff, prevention and care of pressure sores, and incontinence care; and

1 Section 2. Section 53-21-127, MCA, is amended to read:
2 "53-21-127. (Temporary) Posttrial disposition. (1) If, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent
3 is not suffering from a mental disorder or does not require commitment within the meaning of this part, the
4 respondent must be discharged and the petition dismissed.
5 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
6 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
7 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
8 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
9 respondent.
10 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
11 the court shall:
12 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
13 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
14 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
15 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
16 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
17 (i) not more than 3 months; or
18 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
19 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
20 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
21 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
22 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
23 in 53-21-190; or
24 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
25 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
26 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
27 established in administrative rules of the department; and

1 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
2 for admission.
3 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
4 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
5 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
6 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
7 treatment.
8 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
9 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
10 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
11 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
12 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
13 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
14 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
15 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
16 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
17 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
18 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
19 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
20 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
21 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
22 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
23 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
24 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may
25 require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living facility, or a
26 program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and may not require
27 commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health nursing

1 care center.
2 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
3 fact:
4 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
5 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
6 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
7 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
8 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
9 respondent;
10 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
11 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
12 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
13 chosen from among other alternatives;
14 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
15 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
16 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
17 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
18 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
19 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
20 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
21 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
22 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
23 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
24 from among other alternatives.
25 53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and
26 the petition dismissed if, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent:
27 (a) is not suffering from a mental disorder;

1 (b) does not require commitment within the meaning of this part; or
2 (c) is suffering from a mental disorder but the respondent's primary diagnosis is Alzheimer's
3 disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
4 criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).
5 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
6 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
7 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
8 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
9 respondent.
10 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
11 the court shall:
12 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
13 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
14 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
15 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
16 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
17 (i) not more than 3 months; or
18 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
19 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent is committed to a
20 category D assisted living facility as provided in 53-21-199 or if a respondent has been previously involuntarily
21 committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines that the admission of
22 evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of predictability, as provided in 53-
23 21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided in 53-21-190; or
24 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
25 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
26 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and

1 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
2 for admission.
3 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
4 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
5 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
6 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
7 treatment.
8 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
9 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
10 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
11 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
12 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
13 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
14 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
15 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
16 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
17 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
18 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after

24 justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter. However, if the court relies solely on the criterion provided in 53-
25 21-126(1)(d), the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Milly Allen, SB0524.002.001
1 diversion to category D assisted living facilities. (1) It is the intent of the legislature to divert individuals from
2 all forms of involuntary commitment. When it is not possible to divert an individual from involuntary commitment,
3 it is the intent of the legislature that commitment to the Montana state hospital serves as a last resort because
4 the Montana state hospital is the most restrictive and least cost-effective form of mental health treatment in the
5 state.
6 (1) (2) Subject to subsection (3), a A person with a mental disorder who is detained or considered for
7 detention under 53-21-120(4) may, upon meeting the requirements in 50-5-226(5), request diversion be
8 diverted to a category D assisted living facility pursuant to the processes outlined in this section.
9 (3) A court may dismiss involuntary treatment proceedings to facilitate voluntary treatment at a
10 category D assisted living facility if:
11 (a) the court finds that a person detained or considered for detention under this chapter is likely to
12 benefit from the services of a category D assisted living facility;
13 (b) a category D assisted living facility is willing to serve the person; and
14 (c) the person is willing to receive services from the category D assisted living facility.
15 (2) (4) If voluntary diversion to a category D facility as provided in subsection (3) is not possible and a
16 court, after obtaining the results of an examination as provided in 53-21-123, finds that a short-term inpatient
17 treatment is inappropriate for a person who otherwise is eligible for involuntary commitment to the Montana
18 state hospital, the court may initiate the process necessary to determine eligibility for residency in to divert the
19 person from the Montana state hospital by ordering involuntary commitment to a category D assisted living
20 facility.
21 (3) (5) For a person to be eligible for diversion from the Montana state hospital to a category D
22 assisted living facility pursuant to subsection (4), a court determination and an examination under 53-21-123
23 must indicate that the person:
24 (a) is not suffering acute psychosis; meets the requirements of commitment;
25 (b) is experiencing behavioral patterns that may make the person a danger to self or others; meets
26 the eligibility requirements of 50-5-226; and
27 (c) is dependent on assistance for two or more activities of daily living; and has been approved for

4 (6) (a) No later than 30 days before the end of a commitment period, the category D assisted living
5 facility that approved a person for admission may provide notice to the court that the facility is no longer able to
6 meet the treatment needs of the person committed to the facility's care.
7 (b) On receipt of the notice from a category D assisted living facility, the court shall initiate the
8 process to determine if the person continues to meet the requirements under subsection (5) for diversion to a
9 category D assisted living facility.
10 (c) If the person meets the requirements for commitment to a category D assisted living facility
11 under subsection (5), but no category D assisted living facility has approved the person for admission, the court
12 may commit the person to the Montana state hospital subject to the provisions of 53-21-127."

24 (6) For category B, C, and D residents, the assisted living facility shall specify services that it will
25 provide in the facility admission criteria.
26 (7) The department shall develop standardized forms and education and training materials to

14 under subsection (8)(b) may be appealed by the facility operator or by or on behalf of a resident or prospective
15 resident;
16 (d) standards for operating a category A assisted living facility, including standards for the physical,
17 structural, environmental, sanitary, infection control, dietary, social, staffing, and recordkeeping components of
18 a facility and the storage and administration of over-the-counter and prescription medications;
19 (e) standards for operating a category B assisted living facility, which must include the standards
20 for a category A assisted living facility and additional standards for assessment of residents, care planning,
21 qualifications and training of staff, prevention and care of pressure sores, and incontinence care; and

1 Section 2. Section 53-21-127, MCA, is amended to read:
2 "53-21-127. (Temporary) Posttrial disposition. (1) If, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent
3 is not suffering from a mental disorder or does not require commitment within the meaning of this part, the
4 respondent must be discharged and the petition dismissed.
5 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
6 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
7 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
8 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
9 respondent.
10 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
11 the court shall:
12 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
13 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
14 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
15 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
16 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
17 (i) not more than 3 months; or
18 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
19 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
20 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
21 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
22 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
23 in 53-21-190; or
24 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
25 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
26 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
27 established in administrative rules of the department; and

1 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
2 for admission.
3 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
4 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
5 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
6 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
7 treatment.
8 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
9 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
10 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
11 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
12 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
13 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
14 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
15 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
16 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
17 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
18 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
19 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
20 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
21 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
22 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
23 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
24 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may
25 require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living facility, or a
26 program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and may not require
27 commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health nursing

1 care center.
2 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
3 fact:
4 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
5 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
6 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
7 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
8 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
9 respondent;
10 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
11 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
12 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
13 chosen from among other alternatives;
14 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
15 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
16 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
17 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
18 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
19 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
20 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
21 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
22 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
23 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
24 from among other alternatives.
25 53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and
26 the petition dismissed if, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent:
27 (a) is not suffering from a mental disorder;

1 (b) does not require commitment within the meaning of this part; or
2 (c) is suffering from a mental disorder but the respondent's primary diagnosis is Alzheimer's
3 disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
4 criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).
5 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
6 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
7 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
8 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
9 respondent.
10 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
11 the court shall:
12 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
13 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
14 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
15 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
16 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
17 (i) not more than 3 months; or
18 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
19 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent is committed to a
20 category D assisted living facility as provided in 53-21-199 or if a respondent has been previously involuntarily
21 committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines that the admission of
22 evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of predictability, as provided in 53-
23 21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided in 53-21-190; or
24 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
25 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
26 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and

1 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
2 for admission.
3 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
4 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
5 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
6 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
7 treatment.
8 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
9 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
10 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
11 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
12 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
13 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
14 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
15 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
16 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
17 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
18 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after

20 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be

24 justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter. However, if the court relies solely on the criterion provided in 53-

19 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
20 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
21 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
22 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
23 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
24 from among other alternatives."

Amendment - 1st Reading-white - Requested by: Dennis Lenz - Conference Committee on
SB 524

69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Milly Allen, SB0524.002.001
1 diversion to category D assisted living facilities. (1) It is the intent of the legislature to divert individuals from
2 all forms of involuntary commitment. When it is not possible to divert an individual from involuntary commitment,
3 it is the intent of the legislature that commitment to the Montana state hospital serves as a last resort because
4 the Montana state hospital is the most restrictive and least cost-effective form of mental health treatment in the
5 state.
6 (1) (2) Subject to subsection (3), a A person with a mental disorder who is detained or considered for
7 detention under 53-21-120(4) may, upon meeting the requirements in 50-5-226(5), request diversion be
8 diverted to a category D assisted living facility pursuant to the processes outlined in this section.
9 (3) A court may dismiss involuntary treatment proceedings to facilitate voluntary treatment at a
10 category D assisted living facility if:
11 (a) the court finds that a person detained or considered for detention under this chapter is likely to
12 benefit from the services of a category D assisted living facility;
13 (b) a category D assisted living facility is willing to serve the person; and
14 (c) the person is willing to receive services from the category D assisted living facility.
15 (2) (4) If voluntary diversion to a category D facility as provided in subsection (3) is not possible and a
16 court, after obtaining the results of an examination as provided in 53-21-123, finds that a short-term inpatient
17 treatment is inappropriate for a person who otherwise is eligible for involuntary commitment to the Montana
18 state hospital, the court may initiate the process necessary to determine eligibility for residency in to divert the
19 person from the Montana state hospital by ordering involuntary commitment to a category D assisted living
20 facility.
21 (3) (5) For a person to be eligible for diversion from the Montana state hospital to a category D
22 assisted living facility pursuant to subsection (4), a court determination and an examination under 53-21-123
23 must indicate that the person:
24 (a) is not suffering acute psychosis; meets the requirements of commitment;
25 (b) is experiencing behavioral patterns that may make the person a danger to self or others; meets
26 the eligibility requirements of 50-5-226; and
27 (c) is dependent on assistance for two or more activities of daily living; and has been approved for

1 admission by a category D assisted living facility.
2 (d) is more likely to benefit from being in a category D assisted living facility than in the Montana
3 mental health nursing care center or the Montana state hospital.
4 (6) (a) No later than 30 days before the end of a commitment period, the category D assisted living
5 facility that approved a person for admission may provide notice to the court that the facility is no longer able to
6 meet the treatment needs of the person committed to the facility's care.
7 (b) On receipt of the notice from a category D assisted living facility, the court shall initiate the
8 process to determine if the person continues to meet the requirements under subsection (5) for diversion to a
9 category D assisted living facility.
10 (c) If the person meets the requirements for commitment to a category D assisted living facility
11 under subsection (5), but no category D assisted living facility has approved the person for admission, the court
12 may commit the person to the Montana state hospital subject to the provisions of 53-21-127."
