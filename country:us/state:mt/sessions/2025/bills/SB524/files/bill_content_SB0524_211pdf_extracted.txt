17 payments for higher acuity needs and higher rates for facilities that provide more individualized or intensive
18 services to fewer than 15 residents.
19 (ii) By April 1, 2026, the department shall adopt rules and a reimbursement model to implement
20 this subsection (5).
21 (6) For category B, C, and D residents, the assisted living facility shall specify services that it will

5 providers while the resident lives at the facility;
6 (b) standards to be used by a facility and, if appropriate, by a screening agency to screen
7 residents and prospective residents to prevent residence by individuals referred to in subsections (3) through

24 Section 2. Section 53-21-127, MCA, is amended to read:
25 "53-21-127. (Temporary) Posttrial disposition. (1) If, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent
26 is not suffering from a mental disorder or does not require commitment within the meaning of this part, the
27 respondent must be discharged and the petition dismissed.
28 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
2 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
3 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
4 respondent.
5 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
6 the court shall:
7 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
8 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
9 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
10 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
11 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
12 (i) not more than 3 months; or
13 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
14 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
15 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
16 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
17 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
18 in 53-21-190; or
19 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
20 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
21 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
22 established in administrative rules of the department; and
23 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
24 for admission.
25 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
26 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
27 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
28 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 treatment.
2 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
3 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
4 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
5 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
6 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
7 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
8 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
9 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
10 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
11 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
12 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
13 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
14 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
15 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
16 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
17 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
18 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may
19 require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living facility, or a
20 program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and may not require
21 commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health nursing
22 care center.
23 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
24 fact:
25 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
26 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
27 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
28 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
2 respondent;
3 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
4 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
5 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
6 chosen from among other alternatives;
7 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
8 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
9 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
10 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
11 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
12 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
13 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
14 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
15 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
16 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
17 from among other alternatives.
18 53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and
19 the petition dismissed if, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent:
20 (a) is not suffering from a mental disorder;
21 (b) does not require commitment within the meaning of this part; or
22 (c) is suffering from a mental disorder but the respondent's primary diagnosis is Alzheimer's
23 disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
24 criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).
25 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
26 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
27 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
28 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 respondent.
2 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
3 the court shall:
4 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
5 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
6 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
7 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
8 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
9 (i) not more than 3 months; or
10 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
11 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent is committed to a
12 category D assisted living facility as provided in 53-21-199 or if a respondent has been previously involuntarily
13 committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines that the admission of
14 evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of predictability, as provided in 53-
15 21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided in 53-21-190; or
16 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
17 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
18 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
19 established in administrative rules of the department; and
20 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
21 for admission.
22 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
23 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
24 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
25 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
26 treatment.
27 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
28 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
2 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
3 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
4 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
5 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
6 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
7 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
8 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
9 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
10 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
11 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
12 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
13 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
14 (7) Except as provided in 53-21-126(7), satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1)
15 justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter. However, if the court relies solely on the criterion provided in 53-
16 21-126(1)(d), the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D
17 assisted living facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and
18 may not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental
19 health nursing care center.
20 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
21 fact:
22 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
23 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
24 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
25 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
26 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
27 respondent;
28 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
2 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
3 chosen from among other alternatives;
4 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
5 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
6 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
7 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
8 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
9 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
10 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
11 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
12 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
13 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
14 from among other alternatives."

16 Section 3. Section 53-21-199, MCA, is amended to read:
17 "53-21-199. Option for diversion from involuntary commitment to Montana state hospital --
18 diversion to category D assisted living facilities. (1) It is the intent of the legislature to divert individuals from
19 all forms of involuntary commitment. When it is not possible to divert an individual from involuntary commitment,
20 it is the intent of the legislature that commitment to the Montana state hospital serves as a last resort because
21 the Montana state hospital is the most restrictive and least cost-effective form of mental health treatment in the
22 state.
23 (1) (2) Subject to subsection (3), a A person with a mental disorder who is detained or considered for
24 detention under 53-21-120(4) may, upon meeting the requirements in 50-5-226(5), request diversion be
25 diverted to a category D assisted living facility pursuant to the processes outlined in this section.
26 (3) A court may dismiss involuntary treatment proceedings to facilitate voluntary treatment at a
27 category D assisted living facility if:
28 (a) the court finds that a person detained or considered for detention under this chapter is likely to
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 benefit from the services of a category D assisted living facility;
2 (b) a category D assisted living facility is willing to serve the person; and
3 (c) the person is willing to receive services from the category D assisted living facility.
4 (2) (4) If voluntary diversion to a category D facility as provided in subsection (3) is not possible and a
5 court, after obtaining the results of an examination as provided in 53-21-123, finds that a short-term inpatient
6 treatment is inappropriate for a person who otherwise is eligible for involuntary commitment to the Montana
7 state hospital, the court may initiate the process necessary to determine eligibility for residency in to divert the
8 person from the Montana state hospital by ordering involuntary commitment to a category D assisted living
9 facility.
10 (3) (5) For a person to be eligible for diversion from the Montana state hospital to a category D
11 assisted living facility pursuant to subsection (4), a court determination and an examination under 53-21-123
12 must indicate that the person:
13 (a) is not suffering acute psychosis; meets the requirements of commitment;
14 (b) is experiencing behavioral patterns that may make the person a danger to self or others; meets
15 the eligibility requirements of 50-5-226; and
16 (c) is dependent on assistance for two or more activities of daily living; and has been approved for
17 admission by a category D assisted living facility.
18 (d) is more likely to benefit from being in a category D assisted living facility than in the Montana
19 mental health nursing care center or the Montana state hospital.
20 (6) (a) No later than 30 days before the end of a commitment period, the category D assisted living
21 facility that approved a person for admission may provide notice to the court that the facility is no longer able to
22 meet the treatment needs of the person committed to the facility's care.
23 (b) On receipt of the notice from a category D assisted living facility, the court shall initiate the
24 process to determine if the person continues to meet the requirements under subsection (5) for diversion to a
25 category D assisted living facility.
26 (c) If the person meets the requirements for commitment to a category D assisted living facility
27 under subsection (5), but no category D assisted living facility has approved the person for admission, the court
28 may commit the person to the Montana state hospital subject to the provisions of 53-21-127."

8 from the Montana mental health nursing care center as provided in 53-21-127 or 53-21-199. A diversion

18 services to fewer than 15 residents.
19 (ii) By April 1, 2026, the department shall adopt rules and a reimbursement model to implement

21 (6) For category B, C, and D residents, the assisted living facility shall specify services that it will

1 (i) physical and mental standards for residents of assisted living facilities;

5 providers while the resident lives at the facility;
6 (b) standards to be used by a facility and, if appropriate, by a screening agency to screen
7 residents and prospective residents to prevent residence by individuals referred to in subsections (3) through

10 under subsection (8)(b) may be appealed by the facility operator or by or on behalf of a resident or prospective
11 resident;

23
24 Section 2. Section 53-21-127, MCA, is amended to read:
25 "53-21-127. (Temporary) Posttrial disposition. (1) If, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent
26 is not suffering from a mental disorder or does not require commitment within the meaning of this part, the
27 respondent must be discharged and the petition dismissed.
28 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
2 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
3 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
4 respondent.
5 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
6 the court shall:
7 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
8 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
9 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
10 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
11 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
12 (i) not more than 3 months; or
13 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
14 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent has been
15 previously involuntarily committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines
16 that the admission of evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of
17 predictability, as provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided
18 in 53-21-190; or
19 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
20 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
21 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
22 established in administrative rules of the department; and
23 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
24 for admission.
25 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
26 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
27 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
28 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 treatment.
2 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
3 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
4 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
5 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
6 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
7 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
8 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
9 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
10 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
11 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
12 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
13 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
14 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
15 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
16 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
17 (7) Satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1) justifies commitment pursuant to
18 this chapter. However, if the court relies solely upon the criterion provided in 53-21-126(1)(d), the court may
19 require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living facility, or a
20 program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and may not require
21 commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental health nursing
22 care center.
23 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
24 fact:
25 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
26 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
27 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
28 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
- 7 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
2 respondent;
3 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
4 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
5 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
6 chosen from among other alternatives;
7 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
8 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
9 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
10 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
11 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
12 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
13 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
14 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
15 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
16 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
17 from among other alternatives.
18 53-21-127. (Effective July 1, 2025) Posttrial disposition. (1) A respondent must be discharged and
19 the petition dismissed if, upon trial, it is determined that the respondent:
20 (a) is not suffering from a mental disorder;
21 (b) does not require commitment within the meaning of this part; or
22 (c) is suffering from a mental disorder but the respondent's primary diagnosis is Alzheimer's
23 disease, other forms of dementia, or traumatic brain injury and the respondent meets only the commitment
24 criteria outlined in 53-21-126(1)(a) or (1)(d)(i)(B).
25 (2) If it is determined that the respondent is suffering from a mental disorder and requires
26 commitment within the meaning of this part, the court shall hold a posttrial disposition hearing. The disposition
27 hearing must be held within 5 days (including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays unless the fifth day falls on a
28 Saturday, Sunday, or holiday), during which time the court may order further evaluation and treatment of the
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 respondent.
2 (3) At the conclusion of the disposition hearing and pursuant to the provisions in subsection (7),
3 the court shall:
4 (a) subject to the provisions of 53-21-193, commit the respondent to the state hospital or to a
5 behavioral health inpatient facility for a period of not more than 3 months;
6 (b) commit the respondent to a community facility, which may include a category D assisted living
7 facility, or a community program or to any appropriate course of treatment, which may include housing or
8 residential requirements or conditions as provided in 53-21-149, for a period of:
9 (i) not more than 3 months; or
10 (ii) not more than 6 months in order to provide the respondent with a less restrictive commitment in
11 the community rather than a more restrictive placement in the state hospital if a respondent is committed to a
12 category D assisted living facility as provided in 53-21-199 or if a respondent has been previously involuntarily
13 committed for inpatient treatment in a mental health facility and the court determines that the admission of
14 evidence of the previous involuntary commitment is relevant to the criterion of predictability, as provided in 53-
15 21-126(1)(d), and outweighs the prejudicial effect of its admission, as provided in 53-21-190; or
16 (c) commit the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center for a period of not
17 more than 3 months if the following conditions are met:
18 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center as described in 53-21-411 and
19 established in administrative rules of the department; and
20 (ii) the superintendent of the center has issued a written authorization specifying a date and time
21 for admission.
22 (4) Except as provided in subsection (3)(b)(ii), a treatment ordered pursuant to this section may not
23 affect the respondent's custody or course of treatment for a period of more than 3 months.
24 (5) In determining which of the alternatives in subsection (3) to order, the court shall choose the
25 least restrictive alternatives necessary to protect the respondent and the public and to permit effective
26 treatment.
27 (6) The court may authorize the chief medical officer of a facility or a physician designated by the
28 court to administer appropriate medication involuntarily if the court finds that involuntary medication is
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 necessary to protect the respondent or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Medication may not be
2 involuntarily administered to a patient unless the chief medical officer of the facility or a physician designated by
3 the court approves it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration and unless, if possible, a
4 medication review committee reviews it prior to the beginning of the involuntary administration or, if prior review
5 is not possible, within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The medication
6 review committee must include at least one person who is not an employee of the facility or program. The
7 patient and the patient's attorney or advocate, if the patient has one, must receive adequate written notice of
8 the date, time, and place of the review and must be allowed to appear and give testimony and evidence. The
9 involuntary administration of medication must be again reviewed by the committee 14 days and 90 days after
10 the beginning of the involuntary administration if medication is still being involuntarily administered. The mental
11 disabilities board of visitors and the director of the department of public health and human services must be
12 fully informed of the matter within 5 working days after the beginning of the involuntary administration. The
13 director shall report to the governor on an annual basis.
14 (7) Except as provided in 53-21-126(7), satisfaction of any one of the criteria listed in 53-21-126(1)
15 justifies commitment pursuant to this chapter. However, if the court relies solely on the criterion provided in 53-
16 21-126(1)(d), the court may require commitment only to a community facility, which may include a category D
17 assisted living facility, or a program or an appropriate course of treatment, as provided in subsection (3)(b), and
18 may not require commitment at the state hospital, a behavioral health inpatient facility, or the Montana mental
19 health nursing care center.
20 (8) In ordering commitment pursuant to this section, the court shall make the following findings of
21 fact:
22 (a) a detailed statement of the facts upon which the court found the respondent to be suffering
23 from a mental disorder and requiring commitment;
24 (b) the alternatives for treatment that were considered;
25 (c) the alternatives available for treatment of the respondent;
26 (d) the reason that any treatment alternatives were determined to be unsuitable for the
27 respondent;
28 (e) the name of the facility, program, or individual to be responsible for the management and
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524

69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 supervision of the respondent's treatment;
2 (f) if the order includes a requirement for inpatient treatment, the reason inpatient treatment was
3 chosen from among other alternatives;
4 (g) if the order commits the respondent to the Montana mental health nursing care center, a finding
5 that the respondent meets the admission criteria of the center and that the superintendent of the center has
6 issued a written authorization specifying a date and time for admission;
7 (h) if the order provides for an evaluation to determine eligibility for entering a category D assisted
8 living facility, a finding that indicates whether:
9 (i) the respondent meets the admission criteria;
10 (ii) there is availability in a category D assisted living facility; and
11 (iii) a category D assisted living facility is the least restrictive environment because the respondent
12 is unlikely to benefit from involuntary commitment to facilities with more intensive treatment; and
13 (i) if the order includes involuntary medication, the reason involuntary medication was chosen
14 from among other alternatives."

16 Section 3. Section 53-21-199, MCA, is amended to read:
17 "53-21-199. Option for diversion from involuntary commitment to Montana state hospital --
18 diversion to category D assisted living facilities. (1) It is the intent of the legislature to divert individuals from
19 all forms of involuntary commitment. When it is not possible to divert an individual from involuntary commitment,
20 it is the intent of the legislature that commitment to the Montana state hospital serves as a last resort because
21 the Montana state hospital is the most restrictive and least cost-effective form of mental health treatment in the
22 state.
23 (1) (2) Subject to subsection (3), a A person with a mental disorder who is detained or considered for
24 detention under 53-21-120(4) may, upon meeting the requirements in 50-5-226(5), request diversion be
25 diverted to a category D assisted living facility pursuant to the processes outlined in this section.
26 (3) A court may dismiss involuntary treatment proceedings to facilitate voluntary treatment at a
27 category D assisted living facility if:
28 (a) the court finds that a person detained or considered for detention under this chapter is likely to
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – SB 524

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 SB0524.2
1 benefit from the services of a category D assisted living facility;
2 (b) a category D assisted living facility is willing to serve the person; and
3 (c) the person is willing to receive services from the category D assisted living facility.
4 (2) (4) If voluntary diversion to a category D facility as provided in subsection (3) is not possible and a
5 court, after obtaining the results of an examination as provided in 53-21-123, finds that a short-term inpatient
6 treatment is inappropriate for a person who otherwise is eligible for involuntary commitment to the Montana
7 state hospital, the court may initiate the process necessary to determine eligibility for residency in to divert the
8 person from the Montana state hospital by ordering involuntary commitment to a category D assisted living
9 facility.
10 (3) (5) For a person to be eligible for diversion from the Montana state hospital to a category D
11 assisted living facility pursuant to subsection (4), a court determination and an examination under 53-21-123
12 must indicate that the person:
13 (a) is not suffering acute psychosis; meets the requirements of commitment;
14 (b) is experiencing behavioral patterns that may make the person a danger to self or others; meets
15 the eligibility requirements of 50-5-226; and
16 (c) is dependent on assistance for two or more activities of daily living; and has been approved for
17 admission by a category D assisted living facility.
