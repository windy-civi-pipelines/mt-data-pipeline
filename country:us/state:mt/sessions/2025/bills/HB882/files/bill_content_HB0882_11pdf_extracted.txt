5 separated from the rest of the building by permanent walls but may have inside access to the rest of the
6 building at all times even if the businesses or uses in the other part of the building are unrelated to the
7 operation of the premises in which the alcoholic beverages are served. A licensee may lease the kitchen or
8 another specified area to allow another business entity to operate a business within its premises without
9 permanent floor-to-ceiling walls and without a concession agreement if the other business does not take orders
10 for, serve, or deliver alcohol and has a separate point of sale system. If the premises are located in a portion of
11 a building, the licensed retailer must be able to demonstrate that there are adequate safeguards in place to

17 (2) A licensee may alter the approved floorplan of the premises. The alteration must be consistent
18 with the requirements of subsection (1)(a). A licensee shall provide a copy of the revised floorplan with the
19 proposed alteration for the licensed premises to the department within 7 days of beginning the alteration.
20 Department approval may not be unreasonably withheld. If the completed alteration differs from the approved
21 alteration due to modifications required for approval by other state or local government entities, such as
22 compliance with fire or building codes, the department must be notified, but preapproval is not required for
23 these modifications. An alteration for the purposes of this section is any structural change in a premises that
24 does not increase the square footage of the existing approved premises. An alteration that increases the
25 square footage of the existing approved premises must be approved by the department prior to beginning the
26 alteration. A cosmetic change, such as painting, carpeting, or other interior decorating, is not considered an
27 alteration under this section. If the alteration does not require the licensee to obtain a building permit, then the
28 inspections by local government agencies may not be required for department approval.
