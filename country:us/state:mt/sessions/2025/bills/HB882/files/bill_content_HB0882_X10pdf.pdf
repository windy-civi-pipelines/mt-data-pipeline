operation of the premises in which the alcoholic beverages are served. A licensee may lease the kitchen or
another specified area to allow another business entity to operate a business within its premises without

compliance with fire or building codes, the department must be notified, but preapproval is not required for
these modifications. An alteration for the purposes of this section is any structural change in a premises that
does not increase the square footage of the existing approved premises. An alteration that increases the
square footage of the existing approved premises must be approved by the department prior to beginning the
alteration. A cosmetic change, such as painting, carpeting, or other interior decorating, is not considered an
alteration under this section. If the alteration does not require the licensee to obtain a building permit, then the

control and adequate safeguards are in place to prevent public access.
(7) A licensed retailer operating within a hotel or similar short-term lodging facility may apply to the
department to allow for the delivery of alcoholic beverages to guests of accommodation units, and the
prestocking of alcoholic beverages in accommodation units is allowed for the accommodation units within the
property as long as the purchaser's age is verified and there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent
underage service. The application fee is $100.
