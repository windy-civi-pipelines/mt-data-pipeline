69th Legislature 2025 SJ 12
MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY ON ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION CAPACITY ON PATHS 8,
18, 80, AND 83 TO ANALYZE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MONTANA'S CITIZENS AND INDUSTRY DUE
TO THE OBSERVED CONGESTION AND CURTAILMENTS OF TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS; AND
REQUIRING THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, Montana has the best resources for renewable energy in the West, and the demand for
Montana's renewable energy generation is increasing; and
WHEREAS, lack of access to lower-cost power in Montana has already resulted in the loss of large
industrial employers in the state and inhibits the ability to attract new businesses to Montana; and
WHEREAS, large industrial users of electricity wish for more options in requests for proposals to
address electricity needs; and
WHEREAS, Montana's neighboring states have more robust transmission infrastructure and available
capacity than Montana, and the state's energy infrastructure may become inadequate to serve demand; and
WHEREAS, a secure, reliable, and resilient power grid that integrates generation resources serves as
a foundation for an affordable and reliable power supply, a growing economy, and national security; and
WHEREAS, regulators, policymakers, citizens, and industry expect generating resources and the grid
to perform reliably.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
That the Legislative Council be requested to designate an appropriate interim committee or statutory
committee, pursuant to section 5-5-217, MCA, or direct sufficient staff resources to:
(1) investigate issues relating to the available transmission capacity on transmission paths 8, 18,

80, and 83;

congestion and curtailments on Montana transmission paths;
(3) identify and measure the resources in interconnection queues of Montana's transmission
service providers;
(4) sample the depth of market and power supply pricing for Montana's large loads; and
(5) suggest specific transmission capacity upgrades, and associated cost-benefit analysis,
required to maintain a reliable, affordable electric supply for Montana's citizens and industry.
BE FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the study is assigned to staff, any findings or conclusions be
presented to and reviewed by an appropriate committee designated by the Legislative Council.
BE FURTHER RESOLVED, that all aspects of the study, including presentation and review
requirements, be concluded prior to September 15, 2026.
