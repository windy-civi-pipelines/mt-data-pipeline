3
5 MONTANA REQUESTING AN INTERIM STUDY ON ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION CAPACITY ON PATHS 8,
6 18, 80, AND 83 TO ANALYZE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON MONTANA'S CITIZENS AND INDUSTRY DUE
7 TO THE OBSERVED CONGESTION AND CURTAILMENTS OF TRANSMISSION PATHWAYS; AND
8 REQUIRING THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
9
10 WHEREAS, Montana has the best resources for renewable energy in the West, and the demand for
11 Montana's renewable energy generation is increasing; and
12 WHEREAS, lack of access to lower-cost power in Montana has already resulted in the loss of large
13 industrial employers in the state and inhibits the ability to attract new businesses to Montana; and
14 WHEREAS, large industrial users of electricity wish for more options in requests for proposals to
15 address electricity needs; and
16 WHEREAS, Montana's neighboring states have more robust transmission infrastructure and available
17 capacity than Montana, and the state's energy infrastructure may become inadequate to serve demand; and
18 WHEREAS, a secure, reliable, and resilient power grid that integrates generation resources serves as
19 a foundation for an affordable and reliable power supply, a growing economy, and national security; and
20 WHEREAS, regulators, policymakers, citizens, and industry expect generating resources and the grid
21 to perform reliably.
