7 MEDICAL SERVICES THROUGHOUT MONTANA; AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE

9
10 WHEREAS, emergency medical services are essential to a well-functioning health system, providing
11 services such as life-saving treatment, patient transport, and community health outreach; and
12 WHEREAS, reliable emergency medical services response throughout Montana is vital to the well-
13 being of residents, workers, and visitors; and
14 WHEREAS, Montana currently lacks a comprehensive and equitable statewide emergency medical
15 services planning, coordination, and funding system under Title 50, chapter 6, MCA, to ensure the reasonable
16 availability of emergency medical services throughout the state; and
17 WHEREAS, rural emergency medical services are strained, with demand increasing due to population
18 growth, changing demographics, and tourism; and
19 WHEREAS, local emergency medical services agencies, particularly those in rural areas, face rising
20 costs that exceed their resources and capabilities, jeopardizing their ability to meet increased demand for
21 emergency medical services and ensure readiness for residents and visitors; and
22 WHEREAS, funding is often inconsistent or rigid, which fails to ensure that the quality and quantity of
23 emergency medical services needed in various parts of the state align with the present and anticipated future
24 demands for services; and
25 WHEREAS, lack of adequate funding or other critical resources has caused and is causing numerous
26 problems, including but not limited to service calls with delayed response time, inadequate resources to provide
27 care, and, in extreme cases, the complete shutdown of a fire department and their related emergency medical
28 services.
