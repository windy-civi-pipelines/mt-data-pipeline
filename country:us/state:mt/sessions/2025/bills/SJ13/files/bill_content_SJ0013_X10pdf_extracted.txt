PLANNING, COORDINATION, AND FUNDING TO ENSURE THE EQUITABILITY OF EMERGENCY
MEDICAL SERVICES THROUGHOUT MONTANA; AND REQUIRING THAT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE
STUDY BE REPORTED TO THE 70TH LEGISLATURE.
WHEREAS, emergency medical services are essential to a well-functioning health system, providing
services such as life-saving treatment, patient transport, and community health outreach; and
WHEREAS, reliable emergency medical services response throughout Montana is vital to the well-
being of residents, workers, and visitors; and
WHEREAS, Montana currently lacks a comprehensive and equitable statewide emergency medical
services planning, coordination, and funding system under Title 50, chapter 6, MCA, to ensure the reasonable
availability of emergency medical services throughout the state; and
WHEREAS, rural emergency medical services are strained, with demand increasing due to population
growth, changing demographics, and tourism; and
WHEREAS, local emergency medical services agencies, particularly those in rural areas, face rising
costs that exceed their resources and capabilities, jeopardizing their ability to meet increased demand for
emergency medical services and ensure readiness for residents and visitors; and
WHEREAS, funding is often inconsistent or rigid, which fails to ensure that the quality and quantity of
emergency medical services needed in various parts of the state align with the present and anticipated future
demands for services; and
WHEREAS, lack of adequate funding or other critical resources has caused and is causing numerous
problems, including but not limited to service calls with delayed response time, inadequate resources to provide
