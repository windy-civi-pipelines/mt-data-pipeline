20 (1) A day care center must have sufficient indoor and outdoor space for the number and ages of
21 children in care.
22 (2) Calculation of the required minimum 35 square feet of space per child must exclude food
23 preparation areas of the kitchen, bathrooms, toilets, offices, staff rooms, corridors, hallways, closets, lockers,
24 laundry areas, furnace rooms, cabinets, shelving, and other storage spaces.
25 (3) In facilities licensed after June 2, 2006, this requirement shall be deemed to have been

1 usable space per child shall be provided except for:
2 (a) periods when children are using their rest equipment; or
3 (b) when large group activities, such as educational assemblies, occur.
4 (5) During sleep periods, the area must be sufficient to provide spacing between the children using
5 sleep equipment.
6 (6) The equipment and furniture arrangement must permit unobstructed floor area sufficient to
7 allow vigorous play appropriate for each group of children in care, as well as arrangements of any sleeping
8 equipment used which permit easy access to every child and unobstructed exits.
9 (7) Outdoor play areas at the facility must be surrounded by a fence that is at least four feet high
10 and in good repair without any holes or spaces greater than four inches in diameter. Outdoor areas must be
11 designed so that all parts are always visible to allow for direct supervision by child care staff.
12 (8) The center may obtain an exception from the department from the requirements of this rule for
13 the following reasons:
14 (a) limited outdoor space is offset by a greater amount of indoor space, such as a gym, permitting
15 an equivalent activity program, regardless of whether the indoor space is a single open area or multiple
16 separated areas;
17 (b) limited indoor space is offset by sheltered outdoor space where climate permits reliance on
18 outdoor space for activities normally conducted indoors; or
19 (c) limited outdoor or unfenced space is offset by the availability or use of an adjacent school
20 playground, nearby parks, or other safe outdoor play area; or
21 (d) limited outdoor space is offset by the ability of the center to achieve the same objectives of the
22 outdoor space requirement in (1) with space or resources reasonably within the control of the center, including
23 space or resources that are not a single open area, and:
24 (i) the center is within the external boundaries of a city or municipality with a population greater
25 than 15,000 people;
26 (ii) the center is in a business district, defined as the territory contiguous to and including a
27 highway when within any 600 feet along a highway there are buildings in use for business or industrial
28 purposes, including but not limited to hotels, banks, office buildings, railroad stations, and public buildings that
