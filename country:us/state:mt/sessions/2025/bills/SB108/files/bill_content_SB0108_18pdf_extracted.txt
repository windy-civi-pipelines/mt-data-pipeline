7 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
8 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
9 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
10 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
11 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
12 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
13 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
14 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
15 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
16 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
17 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
18 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
19 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
20 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
21 labor.
22 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
23 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
24 including newly taxable property.
25 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
26 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
27 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
28 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;

1 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
2 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
3 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
4 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
5 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
6 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
7 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
8 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
9 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
10 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
11 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
12 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
13 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
14 following tax year.
15 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
16 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
17 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
18 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
19 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
20 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
21 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:
22 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or
23 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
24 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
25 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
26 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
27 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
28 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative

4 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
5 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
6 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.

16 taxes equivalent to the difference between the final determined assessed value and 75% of the original
17 assessed value.

6 Section 9. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
7 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
8 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
9 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
10 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
11 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
12 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
13 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
14 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
15 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
16 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
17 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
18 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
19 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
20 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
21 labor.
22 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
23 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
24 including newly taxable property.
25 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
26 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
27 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
28 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;

1 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
2 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
3 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
4 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
5 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
6 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
7 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
8 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
9 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
10 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
11 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
12 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
13 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
14 following tax year.
15 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
16 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
17 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
18 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
19 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
20 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
21 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:
22 (a) school district levies established in Title 20; or
23 (b) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
24 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
25 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
26 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
27 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
28 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
