20 (ii) specify the grounds of protest; and
21 (iii) not exceed the difference between the payment for the immediately preceding tax year and the

2 refund. If the tax or fee is not paid under protest when due, the appeal or mediation may continue but a tax or
3 fee may not be refunded as a result of the appeal or mediation.
4 (3) If a protested property tax or fee is payable in installments, a subsequent installment portion
5 considered unlawful by the Montana tax appeal board need not be paid and an action or suit need not be
6 commenced to recover the subsequent installment. The determination of the action or suit commenced to
7 recover the first installment portion paid under protest determines the right of the party paying the subsequent
8 installment to have it or any part of it refunded to the party or the right of the taxing authority to collect a
9 subsequent installment not paid by the taxpayer plus interest from the date the subsequent installment was
10 due.
11 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b), all property taxes and fees paid under protest to a
12 county or municipality must be deposited by the treasurer of the county or municipality to the credit of a special

14 any action or suit to recover the taxes and fees unless they are released at the request of the county,
15 municipality, or other local taxing jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (5). This section does not prohibit the
16 investment of the money of this fund in the state unified investment program or in any manner provided in Title
17 7, chapter 6. The provision creating the special protest fund does not apply to any payments made under
18 protest directly to the state.

8 protest remains unresolved may demand that the treasurer of the county or municipality pay the requesting
9 taxing jurisdiction all or a portion of the protest payments to which it is entitled, except the amount paid by the
10 taxpayer in the first year of the protest. The decision in a previous year of a taxing jurisdiction to leave protested
11 taxes in the protest fund does not preclude it from demanding in a subsequent year any or all of the payments
12 to which it is entitled, except the first-year protest amount.
13 (b) The governing body of a taxing jurisdiction affected by the payment of taxes under protest on
14 property that is centrally assessed pursuant to 15-23-101 or on industrial property that is assessed annually by
15 the department in the first and subsequent years that a tax protest remains unresolved may demand that the
16 treasurer of the county or municipality pay the requesting taxing jurisdiction all or a portion of the protest
17 payments to which it is entitled. The decision in a previous year of a taxing jurisdiction to leave protested taxes
18 of centrally assessed property in the protest fund does not preclude it from demanding in a subsequent year
19 any or all of the payments to which it is entitled.
20 (c) The provisions of subsection (5)(b) do not apply to a school district that has elected to waive its
21 right to its portion of protested taxes on centrally assessed property and on industrial property that is assessed
22 annually by the department for that specific year as provided in 15-1-409.
23 (6) (a) If action before the county tax appeal board, Montana tax appeal board, or district court is

26 protested portions of the property tax or fee must be taken from the protest fund or the centrally assessed
27 property tax state special revenue fund and deposited to the credit of the fund or funds to which the property tax
28 belongs, less a pro rata deduction for the costs of administration of the protest fund and related expenses

3 the treasurer of the municipality, county, or state entity levying the tax shall, upon receipt of a certified copy of
4 the final judgment in the action and upon expiration of the time set forth for appeal of the final judgment, refund
5 to the person in whose favor the judgment is rendered the amount of the protested portions of the property tax
6 or fee that the person holding the judgment is entitled to recover, together with interest from the date of
7 payment under protest. The department shall refund from the school district property tax protest state special
8 revenue fund the protested portions of property taxes and interest to a taxpayer in a school district in which the
9 school district has elected to waive its right to its portion of protested taxes for that specific year as provided in
10 15-1-409. If the amount available for the refund in the school district property tax protest state special revenue
11 fund is insufficient to refund the property tax payments, the department shall pay the remainder of the refund
12 from the state general fund.
13 (ii) The taxing jurisdiction shall pay interest at the rate of interest earned by the pooled investment
14 fund provided for in 17-6-203 for the applicable period.
15 (c) If the amount retained in the protest fund is insufficient to pay all sums due the taxpayer, the
16 treasurer shall apply the available amount first to tax repayment, then to interest owed, and lastly to costs.
17 (d) (i) (A) If, after a final determination by the Montana tax appeal board or a court or after
18 settlement of an appeal, the final assessed value of a property that is centrally assessed under 15-23-101 or an
19 industrial property that is annually assessed by the department is less than 75% of the department's original
20 assessed value, the governing body may demand that the state refund from the general fund the protested
21 taxes equivalent to the difference between the final determined assessed value and 75% of the original
22 assessed value.
23 (B) For industrial property under subsection (6)(d)(i)(A) in which the school district has elected to
24 waive its right to its portion of protested taxes for that specific year, the department shall refund from the school
25 district property tax protest state special revenue fund the protested portions of property taxes and interest to a
26 taxpayer.
27 (C) The provisions of subsection (6)(d)(i)(A) do not apply to protested taxes for which the taxpayer
28 protests the classification of the property.

69th Legislature 2025 SB0108.2
1 (ii) If the protest action is decided adversely to a taxing jurisdiction and the amount retained in the
2 protest fund is insufficient to refund the tax payments and costs to which the taxpayer is entitled and for which
3 local government units are responsible, the treasurer shall bill and the taxing jurisdiction shall refund to the
4 treasurer that portion of the taxpayer refund, including tax payments and costs, for which the taxing jurisdiction
5 is proratably responsible. The treasurer is not responsible for the amount required to be refunded by the state
6 treasurer as provided in subsection (6)(b).
7 (iii) For an adverse protest action against the state for centrally assessed property, the department
8 shall refund from the centrally assessed property tax state special revenue fund the amount of protested taxes
9 and from the state general fund the amount of interest as required in subsection (6)(b). The amount refunded
10 for an adverse protested action from the centrally assessed property tax state special revenue fund may not
11 exceed the amount of protested taxes or fees required to be deposited for that action pursuant to subsections
12 (4)(b)(ii) and (4)(b)(iii). If the amount available for the adverse protested action in the centrally assessed
13 property tax state special revenue fund is insufficient to refund the tax payments to which the taxpayer is
14 entitled and for which the state is responsible, the department shall pay the remainder of the refund
15 proportionally from the state general fund and from money deposited in the state special revenue fund levied
16 pursuant to 15-10-109.
17 (e) In satisfying the requirements of subsection (6)(d), the taxing jurisdiction, including the state, is
18 allowed not more than 1 year from the beginning of the fiscal year following a final resolution of the protest. The

12 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
13 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
14 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
15 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
16 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
17 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
18 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
19 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
20 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
21 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
22 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
23 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
24 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
25 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
26 labor.
27 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
28 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,

5 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;

7 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
8 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
9 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
10 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
11 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
12 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
13 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
14 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
15 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
16 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
17 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
18 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
19 following tax year.
20 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
21 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
22 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
23 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
24 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
25 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
26 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:

2 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
3 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
4 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
5 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
6 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
7 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
8 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
9 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
10 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
11 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.

13 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

3 fee may not be refunded as a result of the appeal or mediation.
4 (3) If a protested property tax or fee is payable in installments, a subsequent installment portion
5 considered unlawful by the Montana tax appeal board need not be paid and an action or suit need not be
6 commenced to recover the subsequent installment. The determination of the action or suit commenced to
7 recover the first installment portion paid under protest determines the right of the party paying the subsequent
8 installment to have it or any part of it refunded to the party or the right of the taxing authority to collect a
9 subsequent installment not paid by the taxpayer plus interest from the date the subsequent installment was
10 due.
11 (4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b), all property taxes and fees paid under protest to a

18 protest directly to the state.
19 (b) (i) Property taxes that are levied by the state against property that is centrally assessed
20 pursuant to 15-23-101 and any protested taxes on industrial property that is annually assessed by the

27 special revenue fund.

2 state special revenue fund.
3 (iv) Fifty percent of the funds from a school district that has waived its right to protested taxes must
4 be deposited in the state general fund, and the other 50% must be deposited in a school district property tax

7 jurisdiction affected by the payment of taxes under protest in the second and subsequent years that a tax
8 protest remains unresolved may demand that the treasurer of the county or municipality pay the requesting
9 taxing jurisdiction all or a portion of the protest payments to which it is entitled, except the amount paid by the
10 taxpayer in the first year of the protest. The decision in a previous year of a taxing jurisdiction to leave protested
11 taxes in the protest fund does not preclude it from demanding in a subsequent year any or all of the payments
12 to which it is entitled, except the first-year protest amount.
13 (b) The governing body of a taxing jurisdiction affected by the payment of taxes under protest on
14 property that is centrally assessed pursuant to 15-23-101 or on industrial property that is assessed annually by
15 the department in the first and subsequent years that a tax protest remains unresolved may demand that the
16 treasurer of the county or municipality pay the requesting taxing jurisdiction all or a portion of the protest
17 payments to which it is entitled. The decision in a previous year of a taxing jurisdiction to leave protested taxes
18 of centrally assessed property in the protest fund does not preclude it from demanding in a subsequent year
19 any or all of the payments to which it is entitled.
20 (c) The provisions of subsection (5)(b) do not apply to a school district that has elected to waive its
21 right to its portion of protested taxes on centrally assessed property and on industrial property that is assessed
22 annually by the department for that specific year as provided in 15-1-409.

27 property tax state special revenue fund and deposited to the credit of the fund or funds to which the property tax
28 belongs, less a pro rata deduction for the costs of administration of the protest fund and related expenses

11 Section 9. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
12 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
13 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
14 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
15 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
16 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
17 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
18 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
19 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
20 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
21 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
22 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
23 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
24 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
25 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
26 labor.
27 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
28 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,

4 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
5 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
6 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
7 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
8 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
9 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
10 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
11 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
12 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
13 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
14 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
15 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
16 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
17 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
18 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
19 following tax year.
20 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
21 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
22 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
23 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
24 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
25 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
26 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) does not apply to:

5 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
6 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
7 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
8 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
9 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
10 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
11 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.

13 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
