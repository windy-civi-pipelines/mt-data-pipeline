4 (ii) Upon receipt of the notice, the department shall review the notice and may, before issuing a
5 certificate of water right, return a defective notice for correction or completion, together with the reasons for

7 refiled with the department within 30 days of notification of defects or within a further time as the department
8 may allow, not to exceed 6 months.
9 (iii) If a notice is not corrected and completed within the time allowed, the priority date of

12 with the department, including proof of landowner notification or a written federal special use authorization as
13 necessary under subsection (1). The original of the certificate must be sent to the appropriator. The department

6 force prior to April 14, 1981, with the county clerk and recorder shall file a notice of completion, as provided in

9 filing of a notice, as provided in subsection (3), or the date of the filing of the claim of existing water right.
10 (5) An appropriation under subsection (4) is an existing right, and a permit is not required.
11 However, the department shall acknowledge the receipt of a correct and complete filing of a notice of
12 completion, except that for an appropriation of 35 gallons a minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet a year,
13 the department shall issue a certificate of water right. If a certificate is issued under this section, a certificate
14 need not be issued under the adjudication proceedings provided for in 85-2-236.

16 use by livestock if:
17 (a) the maximum capacity of the impoundment or pit is less than 15 acre-feet;
18 (b) the appropriation is less than 30 acre-feet a year;
19 (c) the appropriation is from an ephemeral stream, an intermittent stream, or another source other
20 than a perennial flowing stream; and
21 (d) the impoundment or pit is to be constructed on and will be accessible to a parcel of land that is
22 owned or under the control of the applicant and that is 40 acres or larger.
23 (7) (a) Within 60 days after constructing an impoundment or pit, the appropriator shall apply for a
24 permit as prescribed by this part. Subject to subsection (7)(b), upon receipt of a correct and complete
25 application for a stock water provisional permit, the department shall automatically issue a provisional permit. If
26 the department determines after a hearing that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely
27 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
28 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights

1 of other appropriators.
2 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
3 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
4 required by federal law to occupy, use, or traverse national forest system lands for the purpose of diversion,
5 impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water under the permit.
6 (8) A person may also appropriate water without applying for or prior to receiving a permit under

7 refiled with the department within 30 days of notification of defects or within a further time as the department
8 may allow, not to exceed 6 months.
9 (iii) If a notice is not corrected and completed within the time allowed, the priority date of

10 (5) An appropriation under subsection (4) is an existing right, and a permit is not required.
11 However, the department shall acknowledge the receipt of a correct and complete filing of a notice of
12 completion, except that for an appropriation of 35 gallons a minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet a year,

18 (b) the appropriation is less than 30 acre-feet a year;
19 (c) the appropriation is from an ephemeral stream, an intermittent stream, or another source other
20 than a perennial flowing stream; and

24 permit as prescribed by this part. Subject to subsection (7)(b), upon receipt of a correct and complete
25 application for a stock water provisional permit, the department shall automatically issue a provisional permit. If
26 the department determines after a hearing that the rights of other appropriators have been or will be adversely
27 affected, it may revoke the permit or require the permittee to modify the impoundment or pit and may then make
28 the permit subject to terms, conditions, restrictions, or limitations that it considers necessary to protect the rights

1 of other appropriators.
2 (b) If the impoundment or pit is on national forest system lands, an application is not correct and
3 complete under this section until the applicant has submitted proof of any written special use authorization
