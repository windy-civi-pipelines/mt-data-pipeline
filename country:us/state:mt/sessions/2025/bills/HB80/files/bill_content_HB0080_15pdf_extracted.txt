17 (2) The department shall retain the deposit of the successful bidder, apply it on the rental for the
18 first year of the lease only, and return any balance of the deposit at the end of the first year to the successful
19 bidder. The department shall return the deposits of the unsuccessful bona fide bidders. If the department finds

4 state or the usual landlord's share prevailing in the district, whichever is greater. The board may, however,
5 approve special crop share rentals of less than one-fourth for high production cost crops, such as but not
6 limited to potatoes and sugar beets, or for high production cost methods when these methods would result in
7 more income to the state. The board may not delegate the authority to approve special crop share rentals.

9 the state, the department may authorize a lease upon on other bases than crop share, but in these cases, the
10 rental must at least equal the value of the usual landlord's share prevailing in the district under similar
11 circumstances, and the department shall set forth in the records the conditions of the case and the rental to be
12 charged.

4 March 1 must be paid and collected at the time of issuing the lease. If the United States is the lessee of state
5 lands for grazing purposes, the rental is payable at the end of each year of the lease. The rental for each
6 succeeding year on a lease issued after July 1, 1999, with the exception of a lease that involves the United

10 (2) For an agricultural lease and for the agricultural portion of a lease containing both grazing and
11 agricultural land, when the rental is paid on a crop share basis, on a cash lease basis, or on a crop share/cash
12 basis, the rental is due in cash on or before November 15 of the year in which the crop is harvested. If the
13 rental is not paid on or before November 15 of the year of crop harvest, a $25 penalty must be imposed on the
14 lessee. If the full rental and the $25 penalty are not paid on or before December 31 of the year in which the crop
15 is harvested, the entire lease is canceled. The department may extend the deadline in writing. If the lessee
16 does not make the rental payment by the date of extension, the entire lease is canceled. Any rental payment
17 made after November 15 of the year in which the crop is harvested, including payment made after an extension
18 of the deadline, must include the $25 penalty.
19 (3) For all state land leases and licenses other than those described in subsections (1) and (2), the
20 department shall impose a $25 penalty for failure to make a rental payment by any deadline established by
21 statute, by rule, or in the lease or license.
22 (4) At least 2 weeks prior to the final deadline for payment under subsection (1) or (2), the
23 department shall send by certified mail to each lessee who has not made payment a letter notifying the lessee
24 that the lease is canceled if payment and the $25 penalty are not received by the final deadline. The notice
25 must be sent to the lessee at the address given in the lease.
26 (5) When a lease is canceled under subsection (1) or (2), the department shall notify the lessee of
27 the cancellation by letter at the address given in the lease.
