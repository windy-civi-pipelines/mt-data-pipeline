21 achieving a better life experience program or to a qualified program established and maintained by another
22 state may reduce taxable income by the lesser of $3,000 or the amount of the contribution. In the case of
23 married taxpayers, each spouse is entitled to a reduction, not to exceed $3,000, for the spouses' contributions
24 to the accounts. Spouses may jointly elect to treat one-half of the total contributions made by the spouses as
25 being made by each spouse. The reduction in taxable income under this subsection (6)(a) applies only with
26 respect to contributions to an account for which the account owner is the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or
27 the taxpayer's child or stepchild if the taxpayer's child or stepchild is a Montana resident. The provisions of
28 subsection (2)(d) do not apply with respect to withdrawals of contributions that reduced taxable income.
