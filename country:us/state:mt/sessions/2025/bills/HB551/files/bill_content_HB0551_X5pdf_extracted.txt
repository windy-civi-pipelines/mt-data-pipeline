Section 2:
Section 1. Program to eliminate reduced-price copayments for school lunch and breakfast --
legislative intent -- rulemaking. (1) The legislature intends to strengthen the opportunity of each child to
develop the child's full education potential in accordance with the goal of the people articulated in Article X,

Section 3:

(a) adequate and proper nutrition is a foundational requirement for learning; and
(b) requiring families that are eligible for reduced-price school meals under the federal school
breakfast program and the national school lunch program to contribute to the cost of meals creates a barrier for
participation and a burden for school administrators for accounting and collection.
(2) From money appropriated for this purpose, the superintendent of public instruction shall
administer a program to distribute replacement funds to school districts electing to eliminate required reduced-
price copayments from reduced-price eligible pupils for school lunch and breakfast under a national or federal
program.
(3) If the amount of appropriated funds is insufficient for the program, the superintendent of public
instruction:
(a) may accept donations from private or out-of-state public sources to support the program; and
(b) shall request additional funding sufficient to support the program in the subsequent biennium.
(4) The superintendent of public instruction shall adopt rules necessary to administer the program.
