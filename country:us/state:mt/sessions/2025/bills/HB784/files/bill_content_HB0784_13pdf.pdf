3 manner:
4 (i) 50% 40% of the sum in the ratio that the population within the corporate limits of the city or
5 town bears to the total population within corporate limits of all the cities and towns in Montana the state;
6 (ii) 50% 40% in the ratio that the city or town street and alley mileage, exclusive of the national

13 (3) (a) For the purpose of allocating the funds in subsections (2)(b) and (2)(c) to a consolidated

15 limit boundaries are the last official city limit boundaries for the former city unless revised boundaries based on
16 the location of the urban area have been approved by the department of transportation and must be used to
17 determine city and county populations and road mileages in the following manner:
18 (i) Percentage factors must be calculated to determine separate populations for the city and rural
19 county by using the last official decennial federal census population figures that recognized an incorporated city
20 and the rural county. The factors must be based on the ratio of the city to the rural county population,
21 considering the total population in the county minus the population of any other incorporated city or town in the
22 county.
23 (ii) The city and county populations must be calculated by multiplying the total county population,
24 as determined by the latest official decennial census or the latest interim year population estimates from the
25 Montana department of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census, minus the population
26 of any other incorporated city or town in that county, by the factors established in subsection (3)(a)(i).
27 (b) The amount allocated by this method for the city and the county must be combined, and single
28 monthly payments must be made to the consolidated city-county government.
