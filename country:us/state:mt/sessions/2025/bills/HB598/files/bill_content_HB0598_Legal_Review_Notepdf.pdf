CONFORMITY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS
As required pursuant to section 5-11-112(1)(c), MCA, it is the Legislative Services Division's
statutory responsibility to conduct "legal review of draft bills". The comments noted below
regarding conformity with state and federal constitutions are provided to assist the Legislature
in making its own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill. The comments are based
on an analysis of jurisdictionally relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the
bill. The comments are not written for the purpose of influencing whether the bill should
become law but are written to provide information relevant to the Legislature's consideration
of this bill. The comments are not a formal legal opinion and are not a substitute for the
judgment of the judiciary, which has the authority to determine the constitutionality of a law
in the context of a specific case.
This review is intended to inform the bill draft requestor of potential constitutional conformity
issues that may be raised by the bill as drafted. This review IS NOT dispositive of the issue of
constitutional conformity and the general rule as repeatedly stated by the Montana Supreme
Court is that an enactment of the Legislature is presumed to be constitutional unless it is
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the enactment is unconstitutional. See Alexander v.
Bozeman Motors, Inc., 356 Mont. 439, 234 P.3d 880 (2010); Eklund v. Wheatland County,
351 Mont. 370, 212 P.3d 297 (2009); St. v. Pyette, 337 Mont. 265, 159 P.3d 232 (2007); and
Elliott v. Dept. of Revenue, 334 Mont. 195, 146 P.3d 741 (2006).
Legal Reviewer Comments:
HB 598, as drafted, may raise potential state constitutional issues. Currently, 13-27-102,
MCA provides that a petition for a statewide ballot issue may only be signed by a qualified
elector of Montana. HB 598 seeks to amend this section to only allow signatures by an active
elector, meaning an elector whose name has not been placed on the inactive list due to failure to
respond to confirmation notices pursuant to 13-2-220 or 13-19-313, MCA.

Article VI, Section 2, of the Montana Constitution defines a qualified elector and
provides “[a]ny citizen of the United States 18 years of age or older who meets the registration
and residence requirements provided by law is a qualified elector unless he is serving a sentence
for a felony in a penal institution or is of unsound mind, as determined by a court.” Furthermore,
Article III, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution provides that a certain number of signatures of
qualified electors must be obtained for initiative petitions. (emphasis added).
Accordingly, the Montana Constitution explicitly defines qualified elector and provides
that the signature requirements for statewide ballot issue petitions are for signatures of qualified
electors. Therefore, as drafted, the amendments sought by HB 598 to require signatures of only
active electors raises potential constitutional conformity issues.
