and applicant testimony to the 69th legislature may result in a proportional reduction in the grant amount.
(2) The grant recipient must document that other matching funds required for completion of the
project are firmly committed.
(3) The grant recipient must have a project management plan that is approved by the department
of natural resources and conservation.
(4) The grant recipient shall comply with the auditing and reporting requirements provided for in 2-

generally accepted accounting principles. Tribal governments shall comply with the auditing and reporting
requirements provided for in 2 CFR 200.

Section 6:
Section 5. Approval of grants -- completion of biennial appropriation. The legislature, pursuant

the establishment of reasonable fees or charges to be made;
(4) describing the terms and conditions for making grants and loans, the security instruments, and
the agreements necessary;
