WHEREAS, the Judicial Standards Commission generally requires the complaint process against

Section 2:
Section 1. Section 3-1-1106, MCA, is amended to read:
"3-1-1106. Investigation of judicial officers -- complaint -- hearing -- recommendations. (1) (a)
The commission, upon the filing of a written complaint by any citizen of the state, shall initiate an investigation
of any judicial officer in the state to determine if there are grounds for conducting additional proceedings before
the commission. If the commission's investigation indicates that additional proceedings before the commission
may be justified, the commission shall require the citizen who filed the original written complaint to sign a
verified written complaint by affidavit before conducting additional proceedings. A citizen has the right to make
public the citizen's complaints concerning a judicial officer at any time.
(b) The commission shall give the judicial officer written notice of the citizen's complaint and of the
initiation of an investigation. Notice must also be given if a verified written complaint by affidavit is filed and
must include the charges made, the grounds for the charges, and a statement that the judicial officer may file
an answer. The notice must be signed by the commission.

of a judicial officer;
(b) publicly advise the judicial officer and the supreme court, in writing, that the complaint will be

satisfactory to the commission; or
(c) request that the supreme court appoint one or more special masters who are judges of courts
of record to hear and take evidence and to report to the commission.
(3) If after a hearing or after considering the record and the report of the masters the commission
finds the charges true, it shall publicly recommend to the supreme court the censure, suspension, removal, or
disability retirement of the judicial officer."

"3-1-1123. Public statements by commission. In any case in which the subject matter becomes
public, through the citizen complainant, through independent sources, through a waiver of confidentiality by the
judge against whom the complaint has been filed, or under other circumstances as the commission considers
appropriate, the commission may issue statements as it considers appropriate in order to:
