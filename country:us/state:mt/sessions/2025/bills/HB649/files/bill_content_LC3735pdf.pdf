21 looks different in each community, but in Montana it includes the following elements:
22 (a) using available funds to support Montana farmers and ranchers;
23 (b) providing support for regional food hubs that can leverage producer relationships to purchase,
24 process, store, and distribute products for and to food banks; and
25 (c) providing access to fresh, healthy, local products for low-income consumers.
26 (2) [Sections 1 through 7] create a pilot program to:
27 (a) support regional food hubs in building producer networks and purchasing, processing, storing,
28 and distributing local food to food pantries;
