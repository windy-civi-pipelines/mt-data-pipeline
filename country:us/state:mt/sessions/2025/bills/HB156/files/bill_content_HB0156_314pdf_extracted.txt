5 (i) be made to the officer designated and authorized to collect it;
6 (ii) specify the grounds of protest; and
7 (iii) not exceed the difference between the payment for the immediately preceding tax year and the

19 considered unlawful by the Montana tax appeal board need not be paid and an action or suit need not be
20 commenced to recover the subsequent installment. The determination of the action or suit commenced to
21 recover the first installment portion paid under protest determines the right of the party paying the subsequent
22 installment to have it or any part of it refunded to the party or the right of the taxing authority to collect a
23 subsequent installment not paid by the taxpayer plus interest from the date the subsequent installment was
24 due.

23 taxing jurisdiction all or a portion of the protest payments to which it is entitled, except the amount paid by the
24 taxpayer in the first year of the protest. The decision in a previous year of a taxing jurisdiction to leave protested

26 to which it is entitled, except the first-year protest amount.
27 (b) The governing body of a taxing jurisdiction affected by the payment of taxes under protest on
28 property that is centrally assessed pursuant to 15-23-101 or on industrial property that is assessed annually by

17 the treasurer of the municipality, county, or state entity levying the tax shall, upon receipt of a certified copy of
18 the final judgment in the action and upon expiration of the time set forth for appeal of the final judgment, refund
19 to the person in whose favor the judgment is rendered the amount of the protested portions of the property tax
20 or fee that the person holding the judgment is entitled to recover, together with interest from the date of
21 payment under protest. The department shall refund from the school district property tax protest state special
22 revenue fund the protested portions of property taxes and interest to a taxpayer in a school district in which the
23 school district has elected to waive its right to its portion of protested taxes for that specific year as provided in

7 taxes equivalent to the difference between the final determined assessed value and 75% of the original
8 assessed value.

14 protests the classification of the property.
15 (ii) If the protest action is decided adversely to a taxing jurisdiction and the amount retained in the
16 protest fund is insufficient to refund the tax payments and costs to which the taxpayer is entitled and for which
17 local government units are responsible, the treasurer shall bill and the taxing jurisdiction shall refund to the
18 treasurer that portion of the taxpayer refund, including tax payments and costs, for which the taxing jurisdiction

23 calculation for tuition purposes is determined by totaling all of the expenditures for all of the district budgeted
24 funds for the preceding school fiscal year and dividing that amount by the October 1 enrollment in the preceding
25 school fiscal year. For the purposes of this subsection, the following do not apply:
26 (a) placement of a child with a disability pursuant to Title 20, chapter 7, part 4;

6 transportation cost for each student in the child's district of residence or 35 cents a mile. The average
7 expenditures for the district transportation fund for the preceding school fiscal year must be calculated by
8 dividing the transportation fund expenditures by the October 1 enrollment for the preceding fiscal year.

13 (2) Upon receipt of school district budget reports required under 20-9-134, the superintendent of
14 public instruction shall provide the department of revenue with a list reporting the maximum general fund
15 budget for each school district.
16 (3) Except as provided by 15-36-332(9), the department of revenue shall make the full quarterly
17 distribution of oil and natural gas production taxes as required under 15-36-332(6) until the amount distributed
18 reaches the limitation in subsection (1) of this section. The department of revenue shall deposit any amount
19 exceeding the limitation in subsection (1) in the guarantee account provided for in 20-9-622.
20 (4) (a) Subject to the limitation in subsection (1) and the conditions in subsection (4)(b), the
21 trustees shall budget and allocate the oil and natural gas production taxes anticipated by the district in any
22 budgeted fund at the discretion of the trustees. Oil and natural gas production taxes allocated to the district
23 general fund may be applied to the BASE or over-BASE portions of the general fund budget at the discretion of
24 the trustees.
25 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(c), if the trustees apply an amount less than 12.5% of the
26 total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior school fiscal year to the district's
27 general fund BASE budget for the upcoming school fiscal year, then:
28 (i) the trustees shall levy the number of mills required to raise an amount equal to the difference

3 budget for the upcoming school fiscal year;
4 (ii) the mills levied under subsection (4)(b)(i) are not eligible for the guaranteed tax base subsidy
5 under the provisions of 20-9-366 through 20-9-369; and
6 (iii) the general fund BASE budget levy requirement calculated in 20-9-141 must be calculated as
7 though the trustees budgeted 12.5% of the oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the
8 prior year and the number of mills calculated in subsection (4)(b)(i) must be added to the number of mills
9 calculated in 20-9-141(2).
10 (c) The provisions of subsection (4)(b) do not apply to the following:
11 (i) a district that has a maximum general fund budget of less than $1 million;
12 (ii) a district whose oil and natural gas revenue combined with its adopted general fund budget
13 totals 105% or less of its maximum general fund budget;

18 pursuant to this section must first be applied by the district to payment of debt service obligations for oil and
19 natural gas revenue bonds for the next 12-month period.
20 (5) (a) The limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school district may retain under
21 subsection (1) must be increased for any school district that was eligible for a significant enrollment increase
22 payment pursuant to 20-9-166. The increase in the limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school
23 district may retain under subsection (1) applies in the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which
24 the district was eligible and must be calculated by multiplying $45,000 times each additional ANB used to
25 calculate the significant enrollment increase payment pursuant to 20-9-166, including the absorption factor
26 reduction.
27 (b) For a district in nonoperating status under 20-9-505, the maximum amount of oil and natural
28 gas production taxes that a school district may retain is 130% of the school district's maximum budget in the

3 are less than 50% of the total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior year, the
4 district may transfer money from any budgeted fund to its general fund in an amount not to exceed the amount

3 determined by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed
4 to eligible counties as close as mathematically possible to the excess amount determined in subsection (3)(c);
5 and
6 (ii) if there is an excess amount remaining after the 305% cap is hit under subsection (3)(c)(i),
7 then:
8 (A) the superintendent shall increase the percentages of the basic and per-ANB entitlements in 20-
9 9-306(2)(b) and (3)(a) by whole numbers not to exceed 45.3% and 90% respectively, then the multiplier used to
10 calculate the statewide elementary and high school guaranteed tax base ratios used for guaranteed tax base
11 funding for the countywide levy for BASE funding support under 20-9-366 by whole numbers in a manner
12 determined by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed
13 to eligible counties as close as mathematically possible to the excess amount remaining without an increase in
14 the amount of countywide BASE funding levies on a statewide basis; and
15 (B) in making the calculations under subsection (3)(c)(ii)(A) and in calculating the guaranteed tax
16 base aid ratios under 20-9-366 for the ensuing school fiscal year, the superintendent shall utilize a GTBA

5 (i) be made to the officer designated and authorized to collect it;
6 (ii) specify the grounds of protest; and
7 (iii) not exceed the difference between the payment for the immediately preceding tax year and the

19 considered unlawful by the Montana tax appeal board need not be paid and an action or suit need not be
20 commenced to recover the subsequent installment. The determination of the action or suit commenced to
21 recover the first installment portion paid under protest determines the right of the party paying the subsequent
22 installment to have it or any part of it refunded to the party or the right of the taxing authority to collect a
23 subsequent installment not paid by the taxpayer plus interest from the date the subsequent installment was
24 due.

22 tax protest remains unresolved may demand that the treasurer of the county or municipality pay the requesting
23 taxing jurisdiction all or a portion of the protest payments to which it is entitled, except the amount paid by the
24 taxpayer in the first year of the protest. The decision in a previous year of a taxing jurisdiction to leave protested

26 to which it is entitled, except the first-year protest amount.
27 (b) The governing body of a taxing jurisdiction affected by the payment of taxes under protest on
28 property that is centrally assessed pursuant to 15-23-101 or on industrial property that is assessed annually by

17 the treasurer of the municipality, county, or state entity levying the tax shall, upon receipt of a certified copy of
18 the final judgment in the action and upon expiration of the time set forth for appeal of the final judgment, refund
19 to the person in whose favor the judgment is rendered the amount of the protested portions of the property tax
20 or fee that the person holding the judgment is entitled to recover, together with interest from the date of
21 payment under protest. The department shall refund from the school district property tax protest state special
22 revenue fund the protested portions of property taxes and interest to a taxpayer in a school district in which the
23 school district has elected to waive its right to its portion of protested taxes for that specific year as provided in

4 settlement of an appeal, the final assessed value of a property that is centrally assessed under 15-23-101 or an
5 industrial property that is annually assessed by the department is less than 75% of the department's original
6 assessed value, the governing body may demand that the state refund from the general fund the protested
7 taxes equivalent to the difference between the final determined assessed value and 75% of the original
8 assessed value.
9 (B) For industrial property under subsection (6)(d)(i)(A) in which the school district has elected to

14 protests the classification of the property.
15 (ii) If the protest action is decided adversely to a taxing jurisdiction and the amount retained in the
16 protest fund is insufficient to refund the tax payments and costs to which the taxpayer is entitled and for which
17 local government units are responsible, the treasurer shall bill and the taxing jurisdiction shall refund to the
18 treasurer that portion of the taxpayer refund, including tax payments and costs, for which the taxing jurisdiction
19 is proratably responsible. The treasurer is not responsible for the amount required to be refunded by the state
20 treasurer as provided in subsection (6)(b).

13 (2) Upon receipt of school district budget reports required under 20-9-134, the superintendent of
14 public instruction shall provide the department of revenue with a list reporting the maximum general fund
15 budget for each school district.
16 (3) Except as provided by 15-36-332(9), the department of revenue shall make the full quarterly
17 distribution of oil and natural gas production taxes as required under 15-36-332(6) until the amount distributed
18 reaches the limitation in subsection (1) of this section. The department of revenue shall deposit any amount
19 exceeding the limitation in subsection (1) in the guarantee account provided for in 20-9-622.
20 (4) (a) Subject to the limitation in subsection (1) and the conditions in subsection (4)(b), the
21 trustees shall budget and allocate the oil and natural gas production taxes anticipated by the district in any
22 budgeted fund at the discretion of the trustees. Oil and natural gas production taxes allocated to the district
23 general fund may be applied to the BASE or over-BASE portions of the general fund budget at the discretion of
24 the trustees.
25 (b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(c), if the trustees apply an amount less than 12.5% of the
26 total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior school fiscal year to the district's
27 general fund BASE budget for the upcoming school fiscal year, then:

3 budget for the upcoming school fiscal year;
4 (ii) the mills levied under subsection (4)(b)(i) are not eligible for the guaranteed tax base subsidy
5 under the provisions of 20-9-366 through 20-9-369; and
6 (iii) the general fund BASE budget levy requirement calculated in 20-9-141 must be calculated as
7 though the trustees budgeted 12.5% of the oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the
8 prior year and the number of mills calculated in subsection (4)(b)(i) must be added to the number of mills
9 calculated in 20-9-141(2).
10 (c) The provisions of subsection (4)(b) do not apply to the following:
11 (i) a district that has a maximum general fund budget of less than $1 million;

21 subsection (1) must be increased for any school district that was eligible for a significant enrollment increase
22 payment pursuant to 20-9-166. The increase in the limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school
23 district may retain under subsection (1) applies in the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which
24 the district was eligible and must be calculated by multiplying $45,000 times each additional ANB used to
25 calculate the significant enrollment increase payment pursuant to 20-9-166, including the absorption factor
26 reduction.
27 (b) For a district in nonoperating status under 20-9-505, the maximum amount of oil and natural
28 gas production taxes that a school district may retain is 130% of the school district's maximum budget in the

3 are less than 50% of the total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior year, the
4 district may transfer money from any budgeted fund to its general fund in an amount not to exceed the amount

16 "20-9-336. School equalization and property tax reduction account -- uses. (1) There is a school
17 equalization and property tax reduction account in the state special revenue fund. Contingent on appropriation
18 by the legislature, money in the account is for distribution to school districts as the second source of funding for
19 state equalization aid as provided in 20-9-343. At fiscal yearend, any fund balance in the account exceeding
20 what was appropriated must be transferred to the guarantee account established in 20-9-622.
21 (2) The account receives revenue as described in 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360.
22 (3) (a) Beginning in fiscal year 2025 2027, each December the superintendent of public instruction
23 shall forecast the amount of revenue the account will receive in that fiscal year by dividing the sum of the
24 taxable value of all property in the state reported by the department of revenue pursuant to 20-9-369 by 1,000
25 to determine a statewide value mill and then multiplying that amount by 95 mills, or the number of mills

3 determined by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed
4 to eligible counties as close as mathematically possible to the excess amount determined in subsection (3)(c);
5 and
6 (ii) if there is an excess amount remaining after the 305% cap is hit under subsection (3)(c)(i),
7 then:
8 (A) the superintendent shall increase the percentages of the basic and per-ANB entitlements in 20-
9 9-306(2)(b) and (3)(a) by whole numbers not to exceed 45.3% and 90% respectively, then the multiplier used to
10 calculate the statewide elementary and high school guaranteed tax base ratios used for guaranteed tax base
11 funding for the countywide levy for BASE funding support under 20-9-366 by whole numbers in a manner
12 determined by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed
13 to eligible counties as close as mathematically possible to the excess amount remaining without an increase in
14 the amount of countywide BASE funding levies on a statewide basis; and
15 (B) in making the calculations under subsection (3)(c)(ii)(A) and in calculating the guaranteed tax
16 base aid ratios under 20-9-366 for the ensuing school fiscal year, the superintendent shall utilize a GTBA
