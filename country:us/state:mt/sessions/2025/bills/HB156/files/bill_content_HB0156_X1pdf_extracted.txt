Section 4:
Section 2. Section 15-1-402, MCA, is amended to read:
"15-1-402. Payment of property taxes or fees under protest. (1) (a) The person upon whom a
property tax or fee is being imposed under this title may, before the property tax or fee becomes delinquent,
pay under written protest that portion of the property tax or fee protested.
(b) The protested payment must:
(i) be made to the officer designated and authorized to collect it;
(ii) specify the grounds of protest; and
(iii) not exceed the difference between the payment for the immediately preceding tax year and the
amount owing in the tax year protested unless a different amount results from the specified grounds of protest,
which may include but are not limited to changes in assessment due to reappraisal under 15-7-111.
(c) If the protested property tax or fee is on property that is subject to central assessment pursuant
to 15-23-101, the person shall report to the department the grounds of the protest and the amount of the
protested payment for each county in which a protested payment was made.
(2) A person appealing a property tax or fee pursuant to Title 15, chapter 2 or 15, including a
person appealing a property tax or fee on property that is annually assessed by the department or subject to
central assessment pursuant to 15-23-101, shall pay the tax or fee under protest when due in order to receive a
refund. If the tax or fee is not paid under protest when due, the appeal or mediation may continue but a tax or
fee may not be refunded as a result of the appeal or mediation.
(3) If a protested property tax or fee is payable in installments, a subsequent installment portion
considered unlawful by the Montana tax appeal board need not be paid and an action or suit need not be
commenced to recover the subsequent installment. The determination of the action or suit commenced to
recover the first installment portion paid under protest determines the right of the party paying the subsequent
installment to have it or any part of it refunded to the party or the right of the taxing authority to collect a
subsequent installment not paid by the taxpayer plus interest from the date the subsequent installment was
due.
(4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b), all property taxes and fees paid under protest to a
county or municipality must be deposited by the treasurer of the county or municipality to the credit of a special
fund to be designated as a protest fund and must be retained in the protest fund until the final determination of
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – HB 156
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 156
any action or suit to recover the taxes and fees unless they are released at the request of the county,
municipality, or other local taxing jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (5). This section does not prohibit the
investment of the money of this fund in the state unified investment program or in any manner provided in Title
7, chapter 6. The provision creating the special protest fund does not apply to any payments made under
protest directly to the state.
(b) (i) Property taxes that are levied by the state against property that is centrally assessed
pursuant to 15-23-101 and any protested taxes on industrial property that is annually assessed by the
department in a school district that has elected to waive its right to protested taxes in a specific year pursuant to

deposited in the state general fund, and the other 50% must be deposited in a centrally assessed property tax
state special revenue fund.

a taxing jurisdiction affected by the payment of taxes under protest in the second and subsequent years that a
tax protest remains unresolved may demand that the treasurer of the county or municipality pay the requesting
taxing jurisdiction all or a portion of the protest payments to which it is entitled, except the amount paid by the
taxpayer in the first year of the protest. The decision in a previous year of a taxing jurisdiction to leave protested
taxes in the protest fund does not preclude it from demanding in a subsequent year any or all of the payments
to which it is entitled, except the first-year protest amount.
(b) The governing body of a taxing jurisdiction affected by the payment of taxes under protest on
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 156

the department in the first and subsequent years that a tax protest remains unresolved may demand that the
treasurer of the county or municipality pay the requesting taxing jurisdiction all or a portion of the protest
payments to which it is entitled. The decision in a previous year of a taxing jurisdiction to leave protested taxes
of centrally assessed property in the protest fund does not preclude it from demanding in a subsequent year
any or all of the payments to which it is entitled.
(c) The provisions of subsection (5)(b) do not apply to a school district that has elected to waive its
right to its portion of protested taxes on centrally assessed property and on industrial property that is assessed
annually by the department for that specific year as provided in 15-1-409.
(6) (a) If action before the county tax appeal board, Montana tax appeal board, or district court is
not commenced within the time specified or if the action is commenced and finally determined in favor of the
department of revenue, county, municipality, or treasurer of the county or the municipality, the amount of the
protested portions of the property tax or fee must be taken from the protest fund or the centrally assessed
property tax state special revenue fund and deposited to the credit of the fund or funds to which the property tax
belongs, less a pro rata deduction for the costs of administration of the protest fund and related expenses
charged to the local government units.
(b) (i) If the action is finally determined adversely to the governmental entity levying the tax, then
the treasurer of the municipality, county, or state entity levying the tax shall, upon receipt of a certified copy of
the final judgment in the action and upon expiration of the time set forth for appeal of the final judgment, refund
to the person in whose favor the judgment is rendered the amount of the protested portions of the property tax
or fee that the person holding the judgment is entitled to recover, together with interest from the date of
payment under protest. The department shall refund from the school district property tax protest state special
revenue fund the protested portions of property taxes and interest to a taxpayer in a school district in which the
school district has elected to waive its right to its portion of protested taxes for that specific year as provided in
15-1-409. If the amount available for the refund in the school district property tax protest state special revenue
fund is insufficient to refund the property tax payments, the department shall pay the remainder of the refund
from the state general fund.
(ii) The taxing jurisdiction shall pay interest at the rate of interest earned by the pooled investment

treasurer shall apply the available amount first to tax repayment, then to interest owed, and lastly to costs.

settlement of an appeal, the final assessed value of a property that is centrally assessed under 15-23-101 or an
industrial property that is annually assessed by the department is less than 75% of the department's original
assessed value, the governing body may demand that the state refund from the general fund the protested
taxes equivalent to the difference between the final determined assessed value and 75% of the original
assessed value.
(B) For industrial property under subsection (6)(d)(i)(A) in which the school district has elected to
waive its right to its portion of protested taxes for that specific year, the department shall refund from the school
district property tax protest state special revenue fund the protested portions of property taxes and interest to a
taxpayer.
(C)(B) The provisions of subsection (6)(d)(i)(A) do not apply to protested taxes for which the taxpayer
protests the classification of the property.
(ii) If the protest action is decided adversely to a taxing jurisdiction and the amount retained in the
protest fund is insufficient to refund the tax payments and costs to which the taxpayer is entitled and for which
local government units are responsible, the treasurer shall bill and the taxing jurisdiction shall refund to the
treasurer that portion of the taxpayer refund, including tax payments and costs, for which the taxing jurisdiction
is proratably responsible. The treasurer is not responsible for the amount required to be refunded by the state
treasurer as provided in subsection (6)(b).
(iii) For an adverse protest action against the state for centrally assessed property, the department
shall refund from the centrally assessed property tax state special revenue fund the amount of protested taxes
and from the state general fund the amount of interest as required in subsection (6)(b). The amount refunded
for an adverse protested action from the centrally assessed property tax state special revenue fund may not
exceed the amount of protested taxes or fees required to be deposited for that action pursuant to subsections
(4)(b)(ii) and (4)(b)(iii). If the amount available for the adverse protested action in the centrally assessed
property tax state special revenue fund is insufficient to refund the tax payments to which the taxpayer is
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 156
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 156
entitled and for which the state is responsible, the department shall pay the remainder of the refund
proportionally from the state general fund and from money deposited in the state special revenue fund levied
pursuant to 15-10-109.
(e) In satisfying the requirements of subsection (6)(d), the taxing jurisdiction, including the state, is
allowed not more than 1 year from the beginning of the fiscal year following a final resolution of the protest. The
taxpayer is entitled to interest on the unpaid balance at the rate referred to in subsection (6)(b) from the date of
payment under protest until the date of final resolution of the protest and at the combined rate of the federal
reserve discount rate quoted from the federal reserve bank in New York, New York, on the date of final
resolution, plus 4 percentage points, from the date of final resolution of the protest until refund is made.

(a) imposition of a property tax to be collected by a special tax protest refund levy;
(b) the general fund or any other funds legally available to the governing body; and
(c) proceeds from the sale of bonds issued by a county, city, or school district for the purpose of

county, city, or school district is authorized to issue the bonds pursuant to procedures established by law. The
bonds may be issued without being submitted to an election. Property taxes may be levied to amortize the
bonds.

district may adopt a general fund budget up to the greater of:
(a) the current year maximum general fund budget; or
(b) the previous year's general fund budget plus any increase in direct state aid for the basic and
per-ANB entitlements and any increases in state funding of the data-for-achievement payment under 20-9-325
and in the general fund payments in 20-9-327 through 20-9-330.
(2) (a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), whenever the trustees of a district propose to adopt

to the electors of the district, as provided in 20-9-353.
(b) The intent of this section is to increase the flexibility and efficiency of elected school boards
without increasing school district property taxes. In furtherance of this intent and provided that budget
limitations otherwise specified in law are not exceeded, the trustees of a district may increase the district's over-
BASE budget levy without a vote if the board of trustees reduces nonvoted property tax levies authorized by
law to be imposed by action of the trustees of the district by at least as much as the amount by which the over-
BASE budget levy is increased. The ongoing authority for any nonvoted increase in the over-BASE budget levy
imposed under this subsection (2)(b) must be decreased in future years to the extent that the trustees of the
district impose any increase in other nonvoted property tax levies.
(3) The BASE budget for the district must be financed by the following sources of revenue:
(a) state equalization aid, as provided in 20-9-343, including any guaranteed tax base aid for which

Section 24:
308.
(2) Upon receipt of school district budget reports required under 20-9-134, the superintendent of
public instruction shall provide the department of revenue with a list reporting the maximum general fund
budget for each school district.
(3) Except as provided by 15-36-332(9), the department of revenue shall make the full quarterly
distribution of oil and natural gas production taxes as required under 15-36-332(6) until the amount distributed
reaches the limitation in subsection (1) of this section. The department of revenue shall deposit any amount
exceeding the limitation in subsection (1) in the guarantee account provided for in 20-9-622.
(4) (a) Subject to the limitation in subsection (1) and the conditions in subsection (4)(b), the
trustees shall budget and allocate the oil and natural gas production taxes anticipated by the district in any
budgeted fund at the discretion of the trustees. Oil and natural gas production taxes allocated to the district
general fund may be applied to the BASE or over-BASE portions of the general fund budget at the discretion of
the trustees.
(b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(c), if the trustees apply an amount less than 12.5% of the
total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior school fiscal year to the district's
general fund BASE budget for the upcoming school fiscal year, then:

ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 156
(i) the trustees shall levy the number of mills required to raise an amount equal to the difference
between 12.5% of the oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior school fiscal year
and the amount of oil and natural gas production taxes the trustees budget in the district's general fund BASE
budget for the upcoming school fiscal year;
(ii) the mills levied under subsection (4)(b)(i) are not eligible for the guaranteed tax base subsidy
under the provisions of 20-9-366 through 20-9-369; and
(iii) the general fund BASE budget levy requirement calculated in 20-9-141 must be calculated as
though the trustees budgeted 12.5% of the oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the
prior year and the number of mills calculated in subsection (4)(b)(i) must be added to the number of mills
calculated in 20-9-141(2).
(c) The provisions of subsection (4)(b) do not apply to the following:
(i) a district that has a maximum general fund budget of less than $1 million;
(ii) a district whose oil and natural gas revenue combined with its adopted general fund budget
totals 105% or less of its maximum general fund budget;
(iii) a district that has a maximum general fund budget of $1 million or more and was eligible for a
significant enrollment increase payment pursuant to 20-9-166 in the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal
year to which the provisions of this subsection (4) would otherwise apply; or
(iv) a district that has issued outstanding oil and natural gas revenue bonds. Funds received
pursuant to this section must first be applied by the district to payment of debt service obligations for oil and
natural gas revenue bonds for the next 12-month period.
(5) (a) The limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school district may retain under
subsection (1) must be increased for any school district that was eligible for a significant enrollment increase
payment pursuant to 20-9-166. The increase in the limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school
district may retain under subsection (1) applies in the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which
the district was eligible and must be calculated by multiplying $45,000 times each additional ANB used to
calculate the significant enrollment increase payment pursuant to 20-9-166, including the absorption factor
reduction.
(b) For a district in nonoperating status under 20-9-505, the maximum amount of oil and natural

district's most recent operating year, determined in accordance with 20-9-308.
(6) In any year in which the actual oil and natural gas production taxes received by a school district
are less than 50% of the total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior year, the
district may transfer money from any budgeted fund to its general fund in an amount not to exceed the amount
of the shortfall."

what was appropriated must be transferred to the guarantee account established in 20-9-622.
(2) The account receives revenue as described in 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360.
(3) Beginning in fiscal year 2025, each December the superintendent of public instruction shall
forecast the amount of revenue the account will receive in that fiscal year by dividing the sum of the taxable
value of all property in the state reported by the department of revenue pursuant to 20-9-369 by 1,000 to
determine a statewide value mill and then multiplying that amount by 95 mills, or the number of mills calculated
by the department of revenue under 15-10-420(8) for the applicable fiscal year. If the forecasted amount differs
from the amount determined through the same calculation in the prior fiscal year by $2 million or more and is:
(a) less, then the superintendent shall:
(i) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school guaranteed
tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets guaranteed tax base ratio for the countywide levy for BASE

years;
(b) more, then the superintendent shall increase the multipliers used in the guaranteed tax base
formulas under 20-9-366 and in the formula for school major maintenance aid under 20-9-525 to the nearest
whole number by an amount calculated by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of
guaranteed tax base aid and school major maintenance aid distributed to eligible counties and school districts
equal to 55% of the increase in the calculated amount between the 2 years in the following order, with any
amount exceeding the caps under subsections (3)(b)(i) through (3)(b)(iii) flowing to the next mechanism:

then:
(A) the superintendent shall increase the percentages of the basic and per-ANB entitlements in 20-

determined by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed
to eligible counties as close as mathematically possible to the excess amount remaining without an increase in
the amount of countywide BASE funding levies on a statewide basis; and
(B) in making the calculations under subsection (3)(c)(ii)(A) and in calculating the guaranteed tax

69th Legislature 2025 HB 156
Section 2. Section 15-1-402, MCA, is amended to read:
"15-1-402. Payment of property taxes or fees under protest. (1) (a) The person upon whom a
property tax or fee is being imposed under this title may, before the property tax or fee becomes delinquent,
pay under written protest that portion of the property tax or fee protested.
(b) The protested payment must:
(i) be made to the officer designated and authorized to collect it;
(ii) specify the grounds of protest; and
(iii) not exceed the difference between the payment for the immediately preceding tax year and the
amount owing in the tax year protested unless a different amount results from the specified grounds of protest,
which may include but are not limited to changes in assessment due to reappraisal under 15-7-111.
(c) If the protested property tax or fee is on property that is subject to central assessment pursuant
to 15-23-101, the person shall report to the department the grounds of the protest and the amount of the
protested payment for each county in which a protested payment was made.
(2) A person appealing a property tax or fee pursuant to Title 15, chapter 2 or 15, including a
person appealing a property tax or fee on property that is annually assessed by the department or subject to
central assessment pursuant to 15-23-101, shall pay the tax or fee under protest when due in order to receive a
refund. If the tax or fee is not paid under protest when due, the appeal or mediation may continue but a tax or
fee may not be refunded as a result of the appeal or mediation.
(3) If a protested property tax or fee is payable in installments, a subsequent installment portion
considered unlawful by the Montana tax appeal board need not be paid and an action or suit need not be
commenced to recover the subsequent installment. The determination of the action or suit commenced to
recover the first installment portion paid under protest determines the right of the party paying the subsequent
installment to have it or any part of it refunded to the party or the right of the taxing authority to collect a
subsequent installment not paid by the taxpayer plus interest from the date the subsequent installment was
due.
(4) (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b), all property taxes and fees paid under protest to a
county or municipality must be deposited by the treasurer of the county or municipality to the credit of a special
fund to be designated as a protest fund and must be retained in the protest fund until the final determination of
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – HB 156
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 156
any action or suit to recover the taxes and fees unless they are released at the request of the county,
municipality, or other local taxing jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (5). This section does not prohibit the
investment of the money of this fund in the state unified investment program or in any manner provided in Title
7, chapter 6. The provision creating the special protest fund does not apply to any payments made under
protest directly to the state.
(b) (i) Property taxes that are levied by the state against property that is centrally assessed
pursuant to 15-23-101 and any protested taxes on industrial property that is annually assessed by the
department in a school district that has elected to waive its right to protested taxes in a specific year pursuant to
15-1-409 must be remitted by the county treasurer to the department for deposit as provided in subsections
(4)(b)(ii) through (4)(b)(iv) (4)(b)(iii).
(ii) The department shall deposit 50% of that portion of the funds levied for the university system
pursuant to 15-10-109 in the state special revenue fund to the credit of the university system, and the other
50% of the funds levied pursuant to 15-10-109 must be deposited in a centrally assessed property tax state
special revenue fund.
(iii) Fifty percent of the funds remaining after the deposit of university system funds must be
deposited in the state general fund, and the other 50% must be deposited in a centrally assessed property tax
state special revenue fund.
(iv) Fifty percent of the funds from a school district that has waived its right to protested taxes must
be deposited in the state general fund, and the other 50% must be deposited in a school district property tax
protest state special revenue fund.
(5) (a) Except as provided in subsections (5)(b) and (5)(c) subsection (5)(b), the governing body of
a taxing jurisdiction affected by the payment of taxes under protest in the second and subsequent years that a
tax protest remains unresolved may demand that the treasurer of the county or municipality pay the requesting
taxing jurisdiction all or a portion of the protest payments to which it is entitled, except the amount paid by the
taxpayer in the first year of the protest. The decision in a previous year of a taxing jurisdiction to leave protested
taxes in the protest fund does not preclude it from demanding in a subsequent year any or all of the payments
to which it is entitled, except the first-year protest amount.
(b) The governing body of a taxing jurisdiction affected by the payment of taxes under protest on
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 156
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 156
property that is centrally assessed pursuant to 15-23-101 or on industrial property that is assessed annually by
the department in the first and subsequent years that a tax protest remains unresolved may demand that the
treasurer of the county or municipality pay the requesting taxing jurisdiction all or a portion of the protest
payments to which it is entitled. The decision in a previous year of a taxing jurisdiction to leave protested taxes
of centrally assessed property in the protest fund does not preclude it from demanding in a subsequent year
any or all of the payments to which it is entitled.
(c) The provisions of subsection (5)(b) do not apply to a school district that has elected to waive its
right to its portion of protested taxes on centrally assessed property and on industrial property that is assessed
annually by the department for that specific year as provided in 15-1-409.
(6) (a) If action before the county tax appeal board, Montana tax appeal board, or district court is
not commenced within the time specified or if the action is commenced and finally determined in favor of the
department of revenue, county, municipality, or treasurer of the county or the municipality, the amount of the
protested portions of the property tax or fee must be taken from the protest fund or the centrally assessed
property tax state special revenue fund and deposited to the credit of the fund or funds to which the property tax
belongs, less a pro rata deduction for the costs of administration of the protest fund and related expenses
charged to the local government units.
(b) (i) If the action is finally determined adversely to the governmental entity levying the tax, then
the treasurer of the municipality, county, or state entity levying the tax shall, upon receipt of a certified copy of
the final judgment in the action and upon expiration of the time set forth for appeal of the final judgment, refund
to the person in whose favor the judgment is rendered the amount of the protested portions of the property tax
or fee that the person holding the judgment is entitled to recover, together with interest from the date of
payment under protest. The department shall refund from the school district property tax protest state special
revenue fund the protested portions of property taxes and interest to a taxpayer in a school district in which the
school district has elected to waive its right to its portion of protested taxes for that specific year as provided in
15-1-409. If the amount available for the refund in the school district property tax protest state special revenue
fund is insufficient to refund the property tax payments, the department shall pay the remainder of the refund
from the state general fund.
(ii) The taxing jurisdiction shall pay interest at the rate of interest earned by the pooled investment
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 156
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 156
fund provided for in 17-6-203 for the applicable period.
(c) If the amount retained in the protest fund is insufficient to pay all sums due the taxpayer, the
treasurer shall apply the available amount first to tax repayment, then to interest owed, and lastly to costs.
(d) (i) (A) If, after a final determination by the Montana tax appeal board or a court or after
settlement of an appeal, the final assessed value of a property that is centrally assessed under 15-23-101 or an
industrial property that is annually assessed by the department is less than 75% of the department's original
assessed value, the governing body may demand that the state refund from the general fund the protested
taxes equivalent to the difference between the final determined assessed value and 75% of the original
assessed value.
(B) For industrial property under subsection (6)(d)(i)(A) in which the school district has elected to
waive its right to its portion of protested taxes for that specific year, the department shall refund from the school
district property tax protest state special revenue fund the protested portions of property taxes and interest to a
taxpayer.
(C)(B) The provisions of subsection (6)(d)(i)(A) do not apply to protested taxes for which the taxpayer
protests the classification of the property.
(ii) If the protest action is decided adversely to a taxing jurisdiction and the amount retained in the
protest fund is insufficient to refund the tax payments and costs to which the taxpayer is entitled and for which
local government units are responsible, the treasurer shall bill and the taxing jurisdiction shall refund to the
treasurer that portion of the taxpayer refund, including tax payments and costs, for which the taxing jurisdiction
is proratably responsible. The treasurer is not responsible for the amount required to be refunded by the state
treasurer as provided in subsection (6)(b).
(iii) For an adverse protest action against the state for centrally assessed property, the department
shall refund from the centrally assessed property tax state special revenue fund the amount of protested taxes
and from the state general fund the amount of interest as required in subsection (6)(b). The amount refunded
for an adverse protested action from the centrally assessed property tax state special revenue fund may not
exceed the amount of protested taxes or fees required to be deposited for that action pursuant to subsections
(4)(b)(ii) and (4)(b)(iii). If the amount available for the adverse protested action in the centrally assessed
property tax state special revenue fund is insufficient to refund the tax payments to which the taxpayer is
- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 156
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 156
entitled and for which the state is responsible, the department shall pay the remainder of the refund
proportionally from the state general fund and from money deposited in the state special revenue fund levied
pursuant to 15-10-109.
(e) In satisfying the requirements of subsection (6)(d), the taxing jurisdiction, including the state, is
allowed not more than 1 year from the beginning of the fiscal year following a final resolution of the protest. The
taxpayer is entitled to interest on the unpaid balance at the rate referred to in subsection (6)(b) from the date of
payment under protest until the date of final resolution of the protest and at the combined rate of the federal
reserve discount rate quoted from the federal reserve bank in New York, New York, on the date of final
resolution, plus 4 percentage points, from the date of final resolution of the protest until refund is made.
(7) A taxing jurisdiction, except the state, may satisfy the requirements of this section by use of
funds from one or more of the following sources:
(a) imposition of a property tax to be collected by a special tax protest refund levy;
(b) the general fund or any other funds legally available to the governing body; and
(c) proceeds from the sale of bonds issued by a county, city, or school district for the purpose of
deriving revenue for the repayment of tax protests lost by the taxing jurisdiction. The governing body of a
county, city, or school district is authorized to issue the bonds pursuant to procedures established by law. The
bonds may be issued without being submitted to an election. Property taxes may be levied to amortize the
bonds.
(8) If the department revises an assessment that results in a refund of taxes of $5 or less, a refund
is not owed."

(b) The intent of this section is to increase the flexibility and efficiency of elected school boards
without increasing school district property taxes. In furtherance of this intent and provided that budget
limitations otherwise specified in law are not exceeded, the trustees of a district may increase the district's over-
BASE budget levy without a vote if the board of trustees reduces nonvoted property tax levies authorized by
law to be imposed by action of the trustees of the district by at least as much as the amount by which the over-
BASE budget levy is increased. The ongoing authority for any nonvoted increase in the over-BASE budget levy
imposed under this subsection (2)(b) must be decreased in future years to the extent that the trustees of the

308.
(2) Upon receipt of school district budget reports required under 20-9-134, the superintendent of
public instruction shall provide the department of revenue with a list reporting the maximum general fund
budget for each school district.
(3) Except as provided by 15-36-332(9), the department of revenue shall make the full quarterly
distribution of oil and natural gas production taxes as required under 15-36-332(6) until the amount distributed
reaches the limitation in subsection (1) of this section. The department of revenue shall deposit any amount
exceeding the limitation in subsection (1) in the guarantee account provided for in 20-9-622.
(4) (a) Subject to the limitation in subsection (1) and the conditions in subsection (4)(b), the

budgeted fund at the discretion of the trustees. Oil and natural gas production taxes allocated to the district
general fund may be applied to the BASE or over-BASE portions of the general fund budget at the discretion of
the trustees.
(b) Except as provided in subsection (4)(c), if the trustees apply an amount less than 12.5% of the
total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior school fiscal year to the district's
general fund BASE budget for the upcoming school fiscal year, then:

69th Legislature 2025 HB 156
(i) the trustees shall levy the number of mills required to raise an amount equal to the difference
between 12.5% of the oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior school fiscal year
and the amount of oil and natural gas production taxes the trustees budget in the district's general fund BASE
budget for the upcoming school fiscal year;
(ii) the mills levied under subsection (4)(b)(i) are not eligible for the guaranteed tax base subsidy
under the provisions of 20-9-366 through 20-9-369; and
(iii) the general fund BASE budget levy requirement calculated in 20-9-141 must be calculated as
though the trustees budgeted 12.5% of the oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the
prior year and the number of mills calculated in subsection (4)(b)(i) must be added to the number of mills
calculated in 20-9-141(2).
(c) The provisions of subsection (4)(b) do not apply to the following:
(i) a district that has a maximum general fund budget of less than $1 million;
(ii) a district whose oil and natural gas revenue combined with its adopted general fund budget
totals 105% or less of its maximum general fund budget;

significant enrollment increase payment pursuant to 20-9-166 in the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal
year to which the provisions of this subsection (4) would otherwise apply; or
(iv) a district that has issued outstanding oil and natural gas revenue bonds. Funds received
pursuant to this section must first be applied by the district to payment of debt service obligations for oil and
natural gas revenue bonds for the next 12-month period.
(5) (a) The limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school district may retain under
subsection (1) must be increased for any school district that was eligible for a significant enrollment increase
payment pursuant to 20-9-166. The increase in the limit on oil and natural gas production taxes that a school
district may retain under subsection (1) applies in the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year in which
the district was eligible and must be calculated by multiplying $45,000 times each additional ANB used to
calculate the significant enrollment increase payment pursuant to 20-9-166, including the absorption factor
reduction.
(b) For a district in nonoperating status under 20-9-505, the maximum amount of oil and natural

district's most recent operating year, determined in accordance with 20-9-308.
(6) In any year in which the actual oil and natural gas production taxes received by a school district
are less than 50% of the total oil and natural gas production taxes received by the district in the prior year, the
district may transfer money from any budgeted fund to its general fund in an amount not to exceed the amount

(3) Beginning in fiscal year 2025, each December the superintendent of public instruction shall
forecast the amount of revenue the account will receive in that fiscal year by dividing the sum of the taxable
value of all property in the state reported by the department of revenue pursuant to 20-9-369 by 1,000 to
determine a statewide value mill and then multiplying that amount by 95 mills, or the number of mills calculated
by the department of revenue under 15-10-420(8) for the applicable fiscal year. If the forecasted amount differs
from the amount determined through the same calculation in the prior fiscal year by $2 million or more and is:
(a) less, then the superintendent shall:
(i) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school guaranteed
tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets guaranteed tax base ratio for the countywide levy for BASE
funding support under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number determined by the superintendent to result in a
decrease in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed to eligible school districts counties equal to 85%
of the decrease in the calculated amount between the 2 years; and
(ii) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school mill value
per ANB for school retirement guaranteed tax base purposes under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number

Section 28. Coordination instruction. If both House Bill No. 483 and [this act] are passed and
approved, then [section 17 of this act], amending 20-9-336, is void and 20-9-336 must be amended as follows:
"20-9-336. School equalization and property tax reduction account -- uses. (1) There is a school
equalization and property tax reduction account in the state special revenue fund. Contingent on appropriation
by the legislature, money in the account is for distribution to school districts as the second source of funding for
state equalization aid as provided in 20-9-343. At fiscal yearend, any fund balance in the account exceeding
what was appropriated must be transferred to the guarantee account established in 20-9-622.
(2) The account receives revenue as described in 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360.
(3) (a) Beginning in fiscal year 2025 2027, each December the superintendent of public instruction
shall forecast the amount of revenue the account will receive in that fiscal year by dividing the sum of the
taxable value of all property in the state reported by the department of revenue pursuant to 20-9-369 by 1,000
to determine a statewide value mill and then multiplying that amount by 95 mills, or the number of mills
calculated by the department of revenue under 15-10-420 (8) for the applicable fiscal year the total number of
mills specified in 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360.
(b) If the forecasted amount in subsection (3)(a) differs from the amount determined through the
same calculation in the prior fiscal year by $2 million or more and is:
(a) less by an amount greater than $2 million, then the superintendent shall:

(i) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school guaranteed
tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets guaranteed tax base ratio for the countywide levy for BASE
funding support under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number determined by the superintendent to result in a
decrease in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed to eligible school districts counties equal to 85%
of the decrease in the calculated amount between the 2 years; and
(ii) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school mill value
per ANB for school retirement guaranteed tax base purposes under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number
determined by the superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of retirement guaranteed tax base aid
distributed to eligible school districts counties equal to 15% of the decrease in the calculated amount between
the 2 years;
(b) more, then the superintendent shall increase the multipliers used in the guaranteed tax base
formulas under 20-9-366 and in the formula for school major maintenance aid under 20-9-525 to the nearest
whole number by an amount calculated by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of
guaranteed tax base aid and school major maintenance aid distributed to eligible counties and school districts
equal to 55% of the increase in the calculated amount between the 2 years in the following order, with any
amount exceeding the caps under subsections (3)(b)(i) through (3)(b)(iii) flowing to the next mechanism:
(i) first, the multiplier used in calculating the statewide mill value per elementary and high school
ANB for retirement purposes, not to exceed 305%;
(ii) second, the multiplier used in calculating the amount of state school major maintenance aid
support for each dollar of local effort, not to exceed 365%; and
(iii) third, the multiplier used in calculating the facility guaranteed mill value per ANB for school
facility entitlement guaranteed tax base purposes, not to exceed 300%.
(c) If the forecasted amount in subsection (3)(a) is greater than the amount determined through
the same calculation in the prior fiscal year, the superintendent, using an amount equal to 50% of the
forecasted revenue growth up to revenue growth of 105% of the prior fiscal year revenue plus all forecasted
revenue growth above 105% of the prior fiscal year revenue, shall:
(i) first increase the multiplier used to calculate statewide mill value per elementary and high
school ANB for retirement purposes under 20-9-366, not to exceed 305%, to the nearest whole number

determined by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed
to eligible counties as close as mathematically possible to the excess amount determined in subsection (3)(c);
and
(ii) if there is an excess amount remaining after the 305% cap is hit under subsection (3)(c)(i),
then:
(A) the superintendent shall increase the percentages of the basic and per-ANB entitlements in 20-
9-306(2)(b) and (3)(a) by whole numbers not to exceed 45.3% and 90% respectively, then the multiplier used to
calculate the statewide elementary and high school guaranteed tax base ratios used for guaranteed tax base
funding for the countywide levy for BASE funding support under 20-9-366 by whole numbers in a manner
determined by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed
to eligible counties as close as mathematically possible to the excess amount remaining without an increase in
the amount of countywide BASE funding levies on a statewide basis; and
(B) in making the calculations under subsection (3)(c)(ii)(A) and in calculating the guaranteed tax
base aid ratios under 20-9-366 for the ensuing school fiscal year, the superintendent shall utilize a GTBA
budget area for the prior year based on the adjusted percentages of the basic and per-ANB entitlements.
(4) (a) The adjustments to the multipliers and percentages under subsection (3) are applicable to
state equalization aid distributions in the fiscal year following the adjustment.
(b) Adjustments to the multipliers and percentages made under subsection (3) remain in effect in
subsequent years unless further changed under 20-9-366 or subsection (3) of this section or as otherwise
provided by law."
