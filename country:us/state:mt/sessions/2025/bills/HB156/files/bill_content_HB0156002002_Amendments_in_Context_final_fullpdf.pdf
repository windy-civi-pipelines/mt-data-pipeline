11 right to its portion of protested taxes on centrally assessed property and on industrial property that is assessed

18 belongs, less a pro rata deduction for the costs of administration of the protest fund and related expenses
19 charged to the local government units.
20 (b) (i) If the action is finally determined adversely to the governmental entity levying the tax, then

23 to the person in whose favor the judgment is rendered the amount of the protested portions of the property tax
24 or fee that the person holding the judgment is entitled to recover, together with interest from the date of
25 payment under protest. The department shall refund from the school district property tax protest state special
26 revenue fund the protested portions of property taxes and interest to a taxpayer in a school district in which the

10 industrial property that is annually assessed by the department is less than 75% of the department's original

12 taxes equivalent to the difference between the final determined assessed value and 75% of the original
13 assessed value.
14 (B) For industrial property under subsection (6)(d)(i)(A) in which the school district has elected to

16 district property tax protest state special revenue fund the protested portions of property taxes and interest to a
17 taxpayer.
18 (C)(B) The provisions of subsection (6)(d)(i)(A) do not apply to protested taxes for which the taxpayer
19 protests the classification of the property.
20 (ii) If the protest action is decided adversely to a taxing jurisdiction and the amount retained in the

22 local government units are responsible, the treasurer shall bill and the taxing jurisdiction shall refund to the
23 treasurer that portion of the taxpayer refund, including tax payments and costs, for which the taxing jurisdiction
24 is proratably responsible. The treasurer is not responsible for the amount required to be refunded by the state
25 treasurer as provided in subsection (6)(b).
26 (iii) For an adverse protest action against the state for centrally assessed property, the department
27 shall refund from the centrally assessed property tax state special revenue fund the amount of protested taxes

2 for an adverse protested action from the centrally assessed property tax state special revenue fund may not
3 exceed the amount of protested taxes or fees required to be deposited for that action pursuant to subsections
4 (4)(b)(ii) and (4)(b)(iii). If the amount available for the adverse protested action in the centrally assessed
5 property tax state special revenue fund is insufficient to refund the tax payments to which the taxpayer is

7 proportionally from the state general fund and from money deposited in the state special revenue fund levied
8 pursuant to 15-10-109.
9 (e) In satisfying the requirements of subsection (6)(d), the taxing jurisdiction, including the state, is

19 (c) proceeds from the sale of bonds issued by a county, city, or school district for the purpose of
20 deriving revenue for the repayment of tax protests lost by the taxing jurisdiction. The governing body of a
21 county, city, or school district is authorized to issue the bonds pursuant to procedures established by law. The
22 bonds may be issued without being submitted to an election. Property taxes may be levied to amortize the
23 bonds.

8 "20-9-336. School equalization and property tax reduction account -- uses. (1) There is a school
9 equalization and property tax reduction account in the state special revenue fund. Contingent on appropriation
10 by the legislature, money in the account is for distribution to school districts as the second source of funding for
11 state equalization aid as provided in 20-9-343. At fiscal yearend, any fund balance in the account exceeding
12 what was appropriated must be transferred to the guarantee account established in 20-9-622.
13 (2) The account receives revenue as described in 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360.
14 (3) (a) Beginning in fiscal year 2025 2027, each December the superintendent of public instruction
15 shall forecast the amount of revenue the account will receive in that fiscal year by dividing the sum of the
16 taxable value of all property in the state reported by the department of revenue pursuant to 20-9-369 by 1,000
17 to determine a statewide value mill and then multiplying that amount by 95 mills, or the number of mills

21 same calculation in the prior fiscal year by $2 million or more and is:
22 (a) less by an amount greater than $2 million, then the superintendent shall:
23 (i) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school guaranteed
24 tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets guaranteed tax base ratio for the countywide levy for BASE
25 funding support under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number determined by the superintendent to result in a
26 decrease in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed to eligible school districts counties equal to 85%

7 formulas under 20-9-366 and in the formula for school major maintenance aid under 20-9-525 to the nearest
8 whole number by an amount calculated by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of

11 amount exceeding the caps under subsections (3)(b)(i) through (3)(b)(iii) flowing to the next mechanism:

17 facility entitlement guaranteed tax base purposes, not to exceed 300%.
18 (c) If the forecasted amount in subsection (3)(a) is greater than the amount determined through
19 the same calculation in the prior fiscal year, the superintendent, using an amount equal to 50% of the
20 forecasted revenue growth up to revenue growth of 105% of the prior fiscal year revenue plus all forecasted
21 revenue growth above 105% of the prior fiscal year revenue, shall:
22 (i) first increase the multiplier used to calculate statewide mill value per elementary and high
23 school ANB for retirement purposes under 20-9-366, not to exceed 305%, to the nearest whole number
24 determined by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed
25 to eligible counties as close as mathematically possible to the excess amount determined in subsection (3)(c);

8 the amount of countywide BASE funding levies on a statewide basis; and
9 (B) in making the calculations under subsection (3)(c)(ii)(A) and in calculating the guaranteed tax
10 base aid ratios under 20-9-366 for the ensuing school fiscal year, the superintendent shall utilize a GTBA
11 budget area for the prior year based on the adjusted percentages of the basic and per-ANB entitlements.
12 (4) (a) The adjustments to the multipliers and percentages under subsection (3) are applicable to
13 state equalization aid distributions in the fiscal year following the adjustment.
