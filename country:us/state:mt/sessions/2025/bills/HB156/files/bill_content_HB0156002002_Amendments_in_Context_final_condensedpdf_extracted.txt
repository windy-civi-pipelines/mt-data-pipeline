8 "20-9-336. School equalization and property tax reduction account -- uses. (1) There is a school
9 equalization and property tax reduction account in the state special revenue fund. Contingent on appropriation
10 by the legislature, money in the account is for distribution to school districts as the second source of funding for
11 state equalization aid as provided in 20-9-343. At fiscal yearend, any fund balance in the account exceeding
12 what was appropriated must be transferred to the guarantee account established in 20-9-622.
13 (2) The account receives revenue as described in 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360.
14 (3) (a) Beginning in fiscal year 2025 2027, each December the superintendent of public instruction
15 shall forecast the amount of revenue the account will receive in that fiscal year by dividing the sum of the
16 taxable value of all property in the state reported by the department of revenue pursuant to 20-9-369 by 1,000
17 to determine a statewide value mill and then multiplying that amount by 95 mills, or the number of mills
18 calculated by the department of revenue under 15-10-420(8) for the applicable fiscal year the total number of
19 mills specified in 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360.
20 (b) If the forecasted amount in subsection (3)(a) differs from the amount determined through the
21 same calculation in the prior fiscal year by $2 million or more and is:
22 (a) less by an amount greater than $2 million, then the superintendent shall:
23 (i) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school guaranteed
24 tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets guaranteed tax base ratio for the countywide levy for BASE
25 funding support under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number determined by the superintendent to result in a
26 decrease in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed to eligible school districts counties equal to 85%

3 determined by the superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of retirement guaranteed tax base aid
4 distributed to eligible school districts counties equal to 15% of the decrease in the calculated amount between
5 the 2 years;
6 (b) more, then the superintendent shall increase the multipliers used in the guaranteed tax base
7 formulas under 20-9-366 and in the formula for school major maintenance aid under 20-9-525 to the nearest
8 whole number by an amount calculated by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of
9 guaranteed tax base aid and school major maintenance aid distributed to eligible counties and school districts
10 equal to 55% of the increase in the calculated amount between the 2 years in the following order, with any
11 amount exceeding the caps under subsections (3)(b)(i) through (3)(b)(iii) flowing to the next mechanism:
12 (i) first, the multiplier used in calculating the statewide mill value per elementary and high school
13 ANB for retirement purposes, not to exceed 305%;

15 support for each dollar of local effort, not to exceed 365%; and
16 (iii) third, the multiplier used in calculating the facility guaranteed mill value per ANB for school
17 facility entitlement guaranteed tax base purposes, not to exceed 300%.
18 (c) If the forecasted amount in subsection (3)(a) is greater than the amount determined through
19 the same calculation in the prior fiscal year, the superintendent, using an amount equal to 50% of the
20 forecasted revenue growth up to revenue growth of 105% of the prior fiscal year revenue plus all forecasted
21 revenue growth above 105% of the prior fiscal year revenue, shall:
22 (i) first increase the multiplier used to calculate statewide mill value per elementary and high
23 school ANB for retirement purposes under 20-9-366, not to exceed 305%, to the nearest whole number
24 determined by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed
25 to eligible counties as close as mathematically possible to the excess amount determined in subsection (3)(c);

8 the amount of countywide BASE funding levies on a statewide basis; and
9 (B) in making the calculations under subsection (3)(c)(ii)(A) and in calculating the guaranteed tax
10 base aid ratios under 20-9-366 for the ensuing school fiscal year, the superintendent shall utilize a GTBA
11 budget area for the prior year based on the adjusted percentages of the basic and per-ANB entitlements.
12 (4) (a) The adjustments to the multipliers and percentages under subsection (3) are applicable to
13 state equalization aid distributions in the fiscal year following the adjustment.
14 (b) Adjustments to the multipliers and percentages made under subsection (3) remain in effect in
