13 Child Welfare Act provided for in Title 41, chapter 3, part 13], the department may, at any time during an abuse
14 and neglect proceeding, make a request for a determination that preservation or reunification services need not
15 be provided. If an indigent parent is not already represented by counsel, the court shall immediately provide for

2 (a) contribute to the support of the child for an aggregate period of 1 year, although able to do so;
3 (b) establish a substantial relationship with the child. A substantial relationship is demonstrated by:
4 (i) visiting the child at least monthly when physically and financially able to do so; or
5 (ii) having regular contact with the child or with the person or agency having the care and custody
6 of the child when physically and financially able to do so; and
7 (iii) manifesting an ability and willingness to assume legal and physical custody of the child if the
8 child was not in the physical custody of the other parent.

13 (4) A judicial finding that preservation or reunification services are not necessary under this section
14 must be supported by clear and convincing evidence proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
15 (5) If the court finds that preservation or reunification services are not necessary pursuant to
16 subsection (2) or (3), a permanency hearing must be held within 30 days of that determination and reasonable
17 efforts, including consideration of both in-state and out-of-state permanent placement options for the child, must
18 be made to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan and to complete
19 whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.
20 (6) If reasonable efforts have been made to prevent removal of a child from the home or to return a
21 child to the child's home but continuation of the efforts is determined by the court to be inconsistent with the
22 permanency plan for the child, the department shall make reasonable efforts to place the child in a timely
23 manner in accordance with the permanency plan, including, if appropriate, placement in another state, and to
24 complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child. Reasonable efforts to
25 place a child permanently for adoption or to make an alternative out-of-home permanent placement may be
26 made concurrently with reasonable efforts to return a child to the child's home. Concurrent planning, including
27 identifying in-state and out-of-state placements, may be used.

2 reasonable time, the court shall enter a finding that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship will likely
3 result in continued abuse or neglect or that the conduct or the condition of the parents renders the parents unfit,
4 unable, or unwilling to give the child adequate parental care. In making the determinations, the court shall
5 consider but is not limited to the following:
6 (a) emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent of a duration or nature as to
7 render the parent unlikely to care for the ongoing physical, mental, and emotional needs of the child within a
8 reasonable time;

18 (b) two medical doctors or clinical psychologists submit testimony that the parent cannot assume
19 the role of parent within a reasonable time;
20 (c) the parent is or will be incarcerated for more than 1 year and reunification of the child with the
21 parent is not in the best interests of the child because of the child's circumstances, including placement options,
22 age, and developmental, cognitive, and psychological needs; or
23 (d) the death or serious bodily injury, as defined in 45-2-101, of a child caused by abuse or neglect
24 by the parent has occurred.
25 (5) If a proceeding under this chapter involves an Indian child and is subject to the federal Indian
26 Child Welfare Act, a qualified expert witness is required to testify that the continued custody of the child by the

17 (4) (a) If, after considering the parent's fitness and interest in reinstatement of parental rights, the

19 order that a hearing on the merits of the petition be held.
20 (b) The court shall provide prior notice of a hearing under subsection (4)(a) to:

6 (c) in accordance with subsection (7), reinstatement of parental rights is in the child's best interest.
7 (6) In determining whether the child has achieved the child's permanency plan or is likely to
8 achieve the child's permanency plan, the court shall review information provided by the department related to
9 any efforts to achieve the permanency plan, including efforts to achieve adoption or a permanent guardianship.
10 (7) In determining whether reinstatement of parental rights is in the child's best interests, the court
11 shall consider but is not limited to the following:
12 (a) whether the parent whose rights are to be reinstated is a fit parent and has remedied the
13 parent's deficiencies documented in the record of the termination proceedings and in the termination order;
14 (b) whether the child is able to express the child's preference;
15 (c) whether the reinstatement of parental rights will present a risk to the child's health, welfare, or
16 safety;
17 (d) whether the benefit to the child of reinstatement of parental rights outweighs the potential lack
18 of permanency for the child; and
19 (e) whether other material changes in circumstances exist that would warrant reinstating parental
20 rights.
21 (8) (a) If the court conditionally grants the petition under subsection (7), the proceedings must be
22 continued for 6 months and a temporary order of reinstatement must be entered.
23 (b) Except as provided in subsection (8)(c), during this time:

28 parent, the department shall petition the court for an order dismissing the temporary reinstatement of parental

1 rights. The court shall grant the petition based on a preponderance of the evidenceclear and convincing
2 evidence that the child has been abused or neglected.
3 (9) (a) After the child has successfully been placed with the parent for 6 months, the court shall
4 enter a final order reinstating parental rights that restores all rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties, and
5 obligations of the parent to the child, including those relating to custody, control, and, subject to subsection
6 (9)(c), support of the child. The court shall direct the clerk of court to provide a certified copy of the final order of
7 reinstatement of parental rights to the parent at no cost.
8 (b) The reinstatement of parental rights pursuant to subsection (9)(a) does not vacate or otherwise
9 affect the validity of the original termination order.
10 (c) A parent whose rights are reinstated under subsection (9)(a) may not be held liable for any
11 child support owed to the department or costs of other services provided to the child for the period beginning on
12 the date parental rights were terminated and ending on the date parental rights were reinstated.
13 (10) This section may not be construed to create a cause of action against the state or its
14 employees concerning the original termination."

2 (b) Copies of all other petitions must be served upon the person or the person's attorney of record

8 agency having legal custody, the court shall immediately provide for the appointment or assignment of an

20 (b) A foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative of the child who is caring for or a relative of the

23 presented on those subjects provided for in 41-3-437(4), determines that the intervention of the person is in the
24 best interests of the child. A person granted intervention pursuant to this subsection is entitled to participate in
25 the adjudicatory hearing held pursuant to 41-3-437 and to notice and participation in subsequent proceedings
26 held pursuant to this chapter involving the custody of the child.

10 425.
11 (12) At any stage of the proceedings considered appropriate by the court, the court may order an
12 alternative dispute resolution proceeding or the parties may voluntarily participate in an alternative dispute
13 resolution proceeding. An alternative dispute resolution proceeding under this chapter may include a family
14 engagement meeting, mediation, or a settlement conference. If a court orders an alternative dispute resolution
15 proceeding, a party who does not wish to participate may file a motion objecting to the order. If the department
16 is a party to the original proceeding, a representative of the department who has complete authority to settle the
17 issue or issues in the original proceeding must be present at any alternative dispute resolution proceeding.
18 (13) Service of a petition under this section must be accompanied by a written notice advising the
19 child's parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child of the:

6 (15) A court may appoint a standing master to conduct hearings and propose decisions and orders
7 to the court for court consideration and action. A standing master may not conduct a proceeding to terminate

2 certified mail, the department must receive a return receipt signed by the person to whom the notice was mailed
3 for the service to be effective. Service of the notice is considered to be effective if, in the absence of a return
4 receipt, the person to whom the notice was mailed appears at the hearing.
5 (7) If personal service cannot be made upon the parents or parent, guardian, or other person or
6 agency having legal custody, the court shall immediately provide for the appointment or assignment of an
7 attorney as provided for in 41-3-425 to represent the unavailable party when, in the opinion of the court, the
8 interests of justice require. If personal service cannot be made upon a putative father, the court may not provide
9 for the appointment or assignment of counsel as provided for in 41-3-425 to represent the father unless, in the
10 opinion of the court, the interests of justice require counsel to be appointed or assigned.

12 guardian, and if there is no guardian, the court shall appoint one.
13 (9) (a) Any person interested in any cause under this chapter has the right to appear. Any foster
14 parent, preadoptive parent, or relative caring for the child must be given legal notice by the attorney filing the
15 petition of all judicial hearings for the child and has the right to be heard. The right to appear or to be heard
16 does not make that person a party to the action. Any foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative caring for the
17 child must be given notice of all reviews by the reviewing body.
18 (b) A foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative of the child who is caring for or a relative of the
19 child who has cared for a child who is the subject of the petition who appears at a hearing set pursuant to this
20 section may be allowed by the court to intervene in the action if the court, after a hearing in which evidence is
21 presented on those subjects provided for in 41-3-437(4), determines that the intervention of the person is in the
22 best interests of the child. A person granted intervention pursuant to this subsection is entitled to participate in
23 the adjudicatory hearing held pursuant to 41-3-437 and to notice and participation in subsequent proceedings
24 held pursuant to this chapter involving the custody of the child.
25 (c) Whenever a child is placed with a foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative, the department

13 Child Welfare Act provided for in Title 41, chapter 3, part 13], the department may, at any time during an abuse
14 and neglect proceeding, make a request for a determination that preservation or reunification services need not
15 be provided. If an indigent parent is not already represented by counsel, the court shall immediately provide for

10 has not been:
11 (i) adjudicated in Montana to be the father of the child for the purposes of child support; or
12 (ii) recorded on the child's birth certificate as the child's father.
13 (4) A judicial finding that preservation or reunification services are not necessary under this section
14 must be supported by clear and convincing evidence proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

19 whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.
20 (6) If reasonable efforts have been made to prevent removal of a child from the home or to return a
21 child to the child's home but continuation of the efforts is determined by the court to be inconsistent with the
22 permanency plan for the child, the department shall make reasonable efforts to place the child in a timely
23 manner in accordance with the permanency plan, including, if appropriate, placement in another state, and to
24 complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child. Reasonable efforts to
25 place a child permanently for adoption or to make an alternative out-of-home permanent placement may be
26 made concurrently with reasonable efforts to return a child to the child's home. Concurrent planning, including
27 identifying in-state and out-of-state placements, may be used.

2 (2) At least 3 working days prior to the permanency hearing, the department shall submit a report
3 regarding the child to the entity that will be conducting the hearing for review. The report must address the
4 department's efforts to effectuate the permanency plan for the child, address the options for the child's
5 permanent placement, examine the reasons for excluding higher priority options, and set forth the proposed
6 plan to carry out the placement decision, including specific times for achieving the plan.
7 (3) At least 3 working days prior to the permanency hearing, the guardian ad litem or an attorney
8 or advocate for a parent or guardian may submit an informational report to the entity that will be conducting the

1 (f) other necessary steps that the department is required to take to effectuate the terms of the
2 plan.
3 (7) In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best
4 interests of the child that does not conflict with the options provided in subsection (8) and that does not require
5 an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
6 expenditures are reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
7 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
8 (8) Permanency options include:
9 (a) reunification of the child with the child's parent or guardian;
10 (b) permanent placement of the child with the noncustodial parent, superseding any existing

18 (ii) the child has an emotional or mental handicap that is so severe that the child cannot function in
19 a family setting and the best interests of the child are served by placement in a residential or group setting;
20 (iii) the child is at least 16 years of age and is participating in an independent living program and
21 that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;

23 continued, frequent contact with the parent, indicate that it would not be in the best interests of the child to
24 terminate parental rights of that parent; or
25 (v) the child meets the following criteria:
26 (A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
27 (B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by
28 the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be

2 (C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been
3 considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
4 (D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
5 long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that
6 placement.
7 (9) For a child 14 years of age or older, the permanency plan must:

10 specialist for the child;
11 (b) identify one person from the case management team, who is selected by the child, to be
12 designated as the child's advisor and advocate for the application of the reasonable and prudent parenting
13 standard; and
14 (c) include services that will be needed to transition the child from foster care to adulthood.
15 (10) A permanency hearing must document the intensive, ongoing, and unsuccessful efforts made
16 by the department to return the child to the child's home or to secure a permanent placement of the child with a
17 relative, legal guardian, or adoptive parent.
18 (11) The court may terminate a planned permanent living arrangement upon petition of the birth
19 parents or the department if the court finds that the circumstances of the child or family have substantially
20 changed and the best interests of the child are no longer being served."

19 (e) whether other material changes in circumstances exist that would warrant reinstating parental
20 rights.
