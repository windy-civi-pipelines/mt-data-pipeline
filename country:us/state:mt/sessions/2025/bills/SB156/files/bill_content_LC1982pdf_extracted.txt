14 shall in good faith:

3 welfare of the child;
4 (viii) identify community resources, including housing, financial, transportation, mental health,
5 substance abuse, and peer support services, and actively assist the parents or, when appropriate, the child's

14 Child Welfare Act provided for in Title 41, chapter 3, part 13], the department may, at any time during an abuse
15 and neglect proceeding, make a request for a determination that preservation or reunification services need not
16 be provided. If an indigent parent is not already represented by counsel, the court shall immediately provide for

1 (3) Preservation or reunification services are not required for a putative father, as defined in 42-2-
2 201, if the court makes a finding that the putative father has failed to do any of the following:
3 (a) contribute to the support of the child for an aggregate period of 1 year, although able to do so;
4 (b) establish a substantial relationship with the child. A substantial relationship is demonstrated by:
5 (i) visiting the child at least monthly when physically and financially able to do so; or
6 (ii) having regular contact with the child or with the person or agency having the care and custody
7 of the child when physically and financially able to do so; and

9 child was not in the physical custody of the other parent.

14 (4) A judicial finding that preservation or reunification services are not necessary under this section
15 must be supported by clear and convincing evidence proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
16 (5) If the court finds that preservation or reunification services are not necessary pursuant to
17 subsection (2) or (3), a permanency hearing must be held within 30 days of that determination and reasonable
18 efforts, including consideration of both in-state and out-of-state permanent placement options for the child, must
19 be made to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan and to complete
20 whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.
21 (6) If reasonable efforts have been made to prevent removal of a child from the home or to return a
22 child to the child's home but continuation of the efforts is determined by the court to be inconsistent with the
23 permanency plan for the child, the department shall make reasonable efforts to place the child in a timely
24 manner in accordance with the permanency plan, including, if appropriate, placement in another state, and to
25 complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child. Reasonable efforts to
26 place a child permanently for adoption or to make an alternative out-of-home permanent placement may be
27 made concurrently with reasonable efforts to return a child to the child's home. Concurrent planning, including
28 identifying in-state and out-of-state placements, may be used.

5 (7) In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best
6 interests of the child that does not conflict with the options provided in subsection (8) and that does not require
7 an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
8 expenditures are reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
9 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
10 (8) Permanency options include:

5 considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
6 (D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
7 long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that

20 (11) The court may terminate a planned permanent living arrangement upon petition of the birth
21 parents or the department if the court finds that the circumstances of the child or family have substantially
22 changed and the best interests of the child are no longer being served."

24 age, and developmental, cognitive, and psychological needs; or
25 (d) the death or serious bodily injury, as defined in 45-2-101, of a child caused by abuse or neglect
26 by the parent has occurred.

17 (c) whether the reinstatement of parental rights will present a risk to the child's health, welfare, or

20 of permanency for the child; and
21 (e) whether other material changes in circumstances exist that would warrant reinstating parental
22 rights.
23 (8) (a) If the court conditionally grants the petition under subsection (7), the proceedings must be

20 child must be given notice of all reviews by the reviewing body.
21 (b) A foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative of the child who is caring for or a relative of the

24 presented on those subjects provided for in 41-3-437(4), determines that the intervention of the person is in the
25 best interests of the child. A person granted intervention pursuant to this subsection is entitled to participate in
26 the adjudicatory hearing held pursuant to 41-3-437 and to notice and participation in subsequent proceedings

11 425.
12 (12) At any stage of the proceedings considered appropriate by the court, the court may order an
13 alternative dispute resolution proceeding or the parties may voluntarily participate in an alternative dispute
14 resolution proceeding. An alternative dispute resolution proceeding under this chapter may include a family
15 engagement meeting, mediation, or a settlement conference. If a court orders an alternative dispute resolution
16 proceeding, a party who does not wish to participate may file a motion objecting to the order. If the department
17 is a party to the original proceeding, a representative of the department who has complete authority to settle the
18 issue or issues in the original proceeding must be present at any alternative dispute resolution proceeding.
19 (13) Service of a petition under this section must be accompanied by a written notice advising the
20 child's parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child of the:
21 (a) right, pursuant to 41-3-425, to appointment or assignment of counsel if the person is indigent or

1 (b) Copies of all other petitions must be served upon the person or the person's attorney of record
2 by certified mail, by personal service, or by publication as provided in 41-3-428 and 41-3-429. If service is by
3 certified mail, the department must receive a return receipt signed by the person to whom the notice was mailed
4 for the service to be effective. Service of the notice is considered to be effective if, in the absence of a return
5 receipt, the person to whom the notice was mailed appears at the hearing.
6 (7) If personal service cannot be made upon the parents or parent, guardian, or other person or
7 agency having legal custody, the court shall immediately provide for the appointment or assignment of an
8 attorney as provided for in 41-3-425 to represent the unavailable party when, in the opinion of the court, the
9 interests of justice require. If personal service cannot be made upon a putative father, the court may not provide
10 for the appointment or assignment of counsel as provided for in 41-3-425 to represent the father unless, in the
11 opinion of the court, the interests of justice require counsel to be appointed or assigned.

15 parent, preadoptive parent, or relative caring for the child must be given legal notice by the attorney filing the

17 does not make that person a party to the action. Any foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative caring for the
18 child must be given notice of all reviews by the reviewing body.
19 (b) A foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative of the child who is caring for or a relative of the
20 child who has cared for a child who is the subject of the petition who appears at a hearing set pursuant to this
21 section may be allowed by the court to intervene in the action if the court, after a hearing in which evidence is
22 presented on those subjects provided for in 41-3-437(4), determines that the intervention of the person is in the
23 best interests of the child. A person granted intervention pursuant to this subsection is entitled to participate in
24 the adjudicatory hearing held pursuant to 41-3-437 and to notice and participation in subsequent proceedings
25 held pursuant to this chapter involving the custody of the child.

12 resolution proceeding. An alternative dispute resolution proceeding under this chapter may include a family
13 engagement meeting, mediation, or a settlement conference. If a court orders an alternative dispute resolution
14 proceeding, a party who does not wish to participate may file a motion objecting to the order. If the department

16 issue or issues in the original proceeding must be present at any alternative dispute resolution proceeding.

10 (c) In determining preservation or reunification services to be provided and in making reasonable
11 efforts at providing preservation or reunification services, the child's health and safety are of paramount

20 whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.
21 (6) If reasonable efforts have been made to prevent removal of a child from the home or to return a
22 child to the child's home but continuation of the efforts is determined by the court to be inconsistent with the

24 manner in accordance with the permanency plan, including, if appropriate, placement in another state, and to
25 complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child. Reasonable efforts to
26 place a child permanently for adoption or to make an alternative out-of-home permanent placement may be

14 provided in 41-3-1010:
15 (A) within 30 days of a determination that reasonable efforts to provide preservation or reunification

20 until the child is permanently placed in either an adoptive or a guardianship placement, the court or the court-
21 approved entity holding the permanency hearing shall conduct a hearing and the court shall issue a finding as

27 this part or with a review held pursuant to 41-3-115 or 41-3-1010 if held within the applicable time limits. If a

4 (2) At least 3 working days prior to the permanency hearing, the department shall submit a report
5 regarding the child to the entity that will be conducting the hearing for review. The report must address the
6 department's efforts to effectuate the permanency plan for the child, address the options for the child's
7 permanent placement, examine the reasons for excluding higher priority options, and set forth the proposed
8 plan to carry out the placement decision, including specific times for achieving the plan.
9 (3) At least 3 working days prior to the permanency hearing, the guardian ad litem or an attorney
10 or advocate for a parent or guardian may submit an informational report to the entity that will be conducting the
11 hearing for review.
12 (4) In a permanency hearing, the court or other entity conducting the hearing shall consult, in an
13 age-appropriate manner, with the child regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan for the child.

20 recommendations, the court may adopt the recommendations as findings with no additional hearing required. In
21 this case, the court shall issue written findings within 10 days of receipt of the written recommendations.
22 (6) The court shall approve a specific permanency plan for the child and make written findings on:
23 (a) whether the child has been asked about the desired permanency outcome;
24 (b) whether the permanency plan is in the best interests of the child;
25 (c) whether the department has made reasonable efforts to effectuate the permanency plan for the
26 individual child;

2 (ii) be placed for adoption, with a legal guardian, or with a fit and willing relative; and
3 (f) other necessary steps that the department is required to take to effectuate the terms of the
4 plan.
5 (7) In its discretion, the court may enter any other order that it determines to be in the best
6 interests of the child that does not conflict with the options provided in subsection (8) and that does not require
7 an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
8 expenditures are reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
9 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
10 (8) Permanency options include:
11 (a) reunification of the child with the child's parent or guardian;
12 (b) permanent placement of the child with the noncustodial parent, superseding any existing

19 (i) the child is being cared for by a fit and willing relative;
20 (ii) the child has an emotional or mental handicap that is so severe that the child cannot function in
21 a family setting and the best interests of the child are served by placement in a residential or group setting;
22 (iii) the child is at least 16 years of age and is participating in an independent living program and
23 that termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child;

25 continued, frequent contact with the parent, indicate that it would not be in the best interests of the child to
26 terminate parental rights of that parent; or
27 (v) the child meets the following criteria:
28 (A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;
- 21 - LC 1982

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1982
1 (B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by
2 the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be
3 contrary to the best interests of the child;
4 (C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been
5 considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and
6 (D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the
7 long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that
8 placement.
9 (9) For a child 14 years of age or older, the permanency plan must:
10 (a) be developed in consultation with the child and in consultation with up to two members of the
11 child's case planning team who are chosen by the child and who are not a foster parent or child protection
12 specialist for the child;
13 (b) identify one person from the case management team, who is selected by the child, to be
14 designated as the child's advisor and advocate for the application of the reasonable and prudent parenting
15 standard; and
16 (c) include services that will be needed to transition the child from foster care to adulthood.
17 (10) A permanency hearing must document the intensive, ongoing, and unsuccessful efforts made
18 by the department to return the child to the child's home or to secure a permanent placement of the child with a
19 relative, legal guardian, or adoptive parent.
20 (11) The court may terminate a planned permanent living arrangement upon petition of the birth
21 parents or the department if the court finds that the circumstances of the child or family have substantially
22 changed and the best interests of the child are no longer being served."

14 (2) In determining whether the conduct or condition of the parents is unlikely to change within a

16 result in continued abuse or neglect or that the conduct or the condition of the parents renders the parents unfit,
17 unable, or unwilling to give the child adequate parental care. In making the determinations, the court shall
18 consider but is not limited to the following:
