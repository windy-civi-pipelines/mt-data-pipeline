3 Section 6. Section 30-2-102, MCA, is amended to read:
4 "30-2-102. Scope -- certain security and other transactions excluded from this chapter. (1)
5 Unless the context otherwise requires, and except as provided in subsection (3), this chapter applies to
6 transactions in goods; it does not apply to any transaction which although in the form of an unconditional
7 contract to sell or present sale is intended to operate only as a security transaction nor does this chapter impair
8 or repeal any statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers and, in the
9 case of a hybrid transaction, it applies to the extent provided in subsection (2).
10 (2) In a hybrid transaction:
11 (a) if the sale-of-goods aspects do not predominate, only the provisions of this chapter that relate
12 primarily to the sale-of-goods aspects of the transaction apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to the
13 transaction as a whole do not apply;
14 (b) if the sale-of-goods aspects predominate, this chapter applies to the transaction but does not
15 preclude application in appropriate circumstances of other law to aspects of the transaction that do not relate to
16 the sale of goods.
17 (3) This chapter does not:
18 (a) apply to a transaction that, even though in the form of an unconditional contract to sell or
19 present sale, operates only to create a security interest; or
20 (b) impair or repeal a statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers, or other specified classes of
21 buyers."

25 sale" -- "conforming" to contract -- "termination" -- "cancellation" -- "hybrid transaction". (1) In this
26 chapter unless the context otherwise requires "contract" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the
27 present or future sale of goods. "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell
28 goods at a future time. A "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price ( 30-2-
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – SB 426
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 426.1
1 401). A "present sale" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.
2 (2) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are "conforming" or conform to the
3 contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.
4 (3) "Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts
5 an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all obligations which are still executory on
6 both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.
7 (4) "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and
8 its effect is the same as that of "termination" except that the canceling party also retains any remedy for breach
9 of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.
10 (5) “Hybrid transaction” means a single transaction involving a sale of goods and:
11 (a) the provision of services;
12 (b) a lease of other goods; or

15 Section 8. Section 30-2-201, MCA, is amended to read:
16 "30-2-201. Formal requirements -- statute of frauds. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this
17 section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or
18 defense unless there is some writing a record sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made
19 between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by the party's authorized
20 agent or broker. A writing record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but
21 the contract is not enforceable under this subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in the writing record.
22 (2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing record in confirmation of the contract
23 and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it
24 satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) against the party unless written notice in a record of objection to its
25 contents is given within 10 days after it is received.
26 (3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) but which is valid in other
27 respects is enforceable:
28 (a) if the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to
- 10 - Authorized Print Version – SB 426

1 others in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and
2 under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial
3 beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or
4 (b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in the party's pleading, testimony, or
5 otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision
6 beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or
7 (c) with respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or which have been
8 received and accepted ( 30-2-606)."
9
10 Section 9. Section 30-2-202, MCA, is amended to read:
11 "30-2-202. Final written expression -- parol or extrinsic evidence. Terms with respect to which the
12 confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing record intended by
13 the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not
14 be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be
15 explained or supplemented:
16 (a) (1) by course of dealing or usage of trade ( 30-1-205) or by course of performance ( 30-2-208);
17 and
18 (b) (2) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been
19 intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement."
20
21 Section 10. Section 30-2-203, MCA, is amended to read:
22 "30-2-203. Seals inoperative. The affixing of a seal to a writing record evidencing a contract for sale
23 or an offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the writing record a sealed instrument and the law with
24 respect to sealed instruments does not apply to such a contract or offer."

11 (2) Any description of leased goods or of the lease term is sufficient and satisfies subsection (1)(b),
12 whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described.
13 (3) A writing record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon, but
14 the lease contract is not enforceable under subsection (1)(b) beyond the lease term and the quantity of goods
15 shown in the writing record.
16 (4) A lease contract that does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1), but which is valid in
17 other respects, is enforceable:

19 of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of verifying that a payment order or communication
20 amending or canceling a payment order is that of the customer or detecting error in the transmission or the
21 content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an obligation on the
22 receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words, or
23 numbers, symbols, sounds, biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.
24 Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the

69th Legislature 2025 SB 426.1
1 "30-4A-202. Authorized and verified payment orders. (1) A payment order received by the
2 receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is
3 otherwise bound by it under the law of agency.
4 (2) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the
5 bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order
6 received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if the
7 security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment
8 orders and the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the bank's
9 obligations under the security procedure and any written agreement or instruction of the customer, evidenced
10 by a record, restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not
11 required to follow an instruction that violates a written an agreement with the customer, evidenced by a record,
12 or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act
13 on it before the payment order is accepted.
14 (3) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by
15 considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the
16 bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank,
17 alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers
18 and receiving banks similarly situated. A security procedure is considered to be commercially reasonable if:
19 (a) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer
20 refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer; and
21 (b) the customer expressly agreed in writing a record to be bound by any payment order, whether
22 or not authorized, issued in the customer's name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank's
23 obligation under the security procedure chosen by the customer.
24 (4) The term "sender" in this chapter includes the customer in whose name a payment order is
25 issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection (1) or if it is effective as the order of

4 Section 30. Section 30-4A-203, MCA, is amended to read:
5 "30-4A-203. Unenforceability of certain verified payment orders. (1) If an accepted payment order
6 is not, under 30-4A-202(1), an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective as an order
7 of the customer pursuant to 30-4A-202(2), the following rules apply:
8 (a) By express written agreement evidenced by a record, the receiving bank may limit the extent to
9 which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order.
10 (b) (i) The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the
11 customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person:
12 (A) entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the
13 security procedure; or
14 (B) who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source
15 controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the
16 security procedure, regardless of how the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault.
17 (ii) Information includes any access device, computer software, or the like.

21 Section 31. Section 30-4A-207, MCA, is amended to read:

23 received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number, or other identification of the beneficiary
24 refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order
25 and acceptance of the order cannot occur.
26 (2) If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name
27 and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the
28 following rules apply:
- 30 - Authorized Print Version – SB 426
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 426.1
1 (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the
2 name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the
3 beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the
4 same person.
5 (b) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and
6 number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the
7 beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no
8 person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.
9 (3) If a payment order described in subsection (2) is accepted, the originator's payment order
10 described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and the beneficiary's bank pays the person
11 identified by number as permitted by subsection (2)(a), the following rules apply:
12 (a) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.
13 (b) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled
14 to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank
15 proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment
16 order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank
17 account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made
18 by any admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the originator,
19 before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record stating the information to which the notice
20 relates.
21 (4) In a case governed by subsection (2)(a), if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person
22 identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the amount paid
23 may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution as
24 follows:
25 (a) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (3), the originator
26 has the right to recover.
27 (b) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the originator's bank
28 has the right to recover."

3 "30-4A-208. Misdescription of intermediary bank or beneficiary's bank. (1) This subsection
4 applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying
5 number as follows:
6 (a) The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or
7 beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank.
8 (b) The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by
9 the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.
10 (2) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's
11 bank, both by name and an identifying number, if the name and number identify different persons as follows:
12 (a) If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification
13 of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not
14 know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the
15 name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to
16 compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its
17 reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.
18 (b) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment
19 order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of
20 the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name,
21 the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by subsection (2)(a), as though
22 the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies
23 the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record
24 stating the information to which the notice relates.
25 (c) Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the
26 proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the
27 sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need

5 Section 33. Section 30-4A-210, MCA, is amended to read:
6 "30-4A-210. Rejection of payment order. (1) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a
7 notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing a record. A notice of rejection
8 need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or
9 will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means
10 that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable,
11 rejection is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes
12 the means to be used to reject a payment order:
13 (a) any means complying with the agreement is reasonable; and
14 (b) any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice
15 resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.
16 (2) This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a
17 payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized
18 account of the sender sufficient to cover the order. If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order
19 on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to
20 pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date
21 to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to 30-4A-211(4) or the day the sender receives notice or
22 learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day. If the
23 withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest is
24 reduced accordingly.
25 (3) If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to it are
26 considered rejected at the time the bank suspends payments.
27 (4) Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order. Rejection of a payment
28 order precludes a later acceptance of the order."

2 Section 34. Section 30-4A-211, MCA, is amended to read:
3 "30-4A-211. Cancellation and amendment of payment order. (1) A communication of the sender of
4 a payment order canceling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally,
5 electronically, or in writing a record. If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving
6 bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified
7 pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.
8 (2) Subject to subsection (1), a communication by the sender canceling or amending a payment
9 order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a
10 manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank
11 accepts the payment order.
12 (3) After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not
13 effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment
14 without agreement of the bank as follows:
15 (a) With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's
16 bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the
17 payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made.
18 (b) (i) With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or
19 amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order or
20 because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer that resulted in the issuance of a payment order:
21 (A) that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender;
22 (B) that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator; or
23 (C) that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to
24 receive from the originator.
25 (ii) If the payment order is canceled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from
26 the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and
27 restitution.

1 transfer business day of the receiving bank after the execution date or payment date of the order.
2 (5) A canceled payment order cannot be accepted. If an accepted payment order is canceled, the
3 acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance. Amendment of a
4 payment order is considered to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and issue of a
5 new payment order in the amended form at the same time.
6 (6) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if
7 the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the
8 sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's
9 agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss
10 and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or
11 amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment.
12 (7) A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal incapacity of the sender unless the
13 receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of competent jurisdiction and
14 has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order.
15 (8) A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with subsection (3)(b)."

21 beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided in

23 (2) If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of 30-4A-302 results in
24 noncompletion of the funds transfer, failure to use an intermediary bank designated by the originator, or

7 contract to sell or present sale is intended to operate only as a security transaction nor does this chapter impair
8 or repeal any statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers and, in the
9 case of a hybrid transaction, it applies to the extent provided in subsection (2).
10 (2) In a hybrid transaction:
11 (a) if the sale-of-goods aspects do not predominate, only the provisions of this chapter that relate

18 defense unless there is some writing a record sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made
19 between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by the party's authorized
20 agent or broker. A writing record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but
21 the contract is not enforceable under this subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in the writing record.

23 and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it

20 amending or canceling a payment order is that of the customer or detecting error in the transmission or the
21 content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an obligation on the
22 receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words, or
23 numbers, symbols, sounds, biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.
24 Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the
25 customer or requiring a payment order to be sent from a known e-mail address, IP address, or telephone

1 "30-4A-202. Authorized and verified payment orders. (1) A payment order received by the
2 receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is
3 otherwise bound by it under the law of agency.
4 (2) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the
5 bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order
6 received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if the
7 security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment
8 orders and the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the bank's
9 obligations under the security procedure and any written agreement or instruction of the customer, evidenced
10 by a record, restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not
11 required to follow an instruction that violates a written an agreement with the customer, evidenced by a record,
12 or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act
13 on it before the payment order is accepted.
14 (3) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by
15 considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the
16 bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank,
17 alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers
18 and receiving banks similarly situated. A security procedure is considered to be commercially reasonable if:
19 (a) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer
20 refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer; and
21 (b) the customer expressly agreed in writing a record to be bound by any payment order, whether
22 or not authorized, issued in the customer's name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank's
23 obligation under the security procedure chosen by the customer.
24 (4) The term "sender" in this chapter includes the customer in whose name a payment order is
25 issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection (1) or if it is effective as the order of
26 the customer under subsection (2).

7 of the customer pursuant to 30-4A-202(2), the following rules apply:

9 which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order.
10 (b) (i) The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the
11 customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person:
12 (A) entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the
13 security procedure; or
14 (B) who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source
15 controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the

23 received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number, or other identification of the beneficiary
24 refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order
25 and acceptance of the order cannot occur.
26 (2) If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name
27 and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the
28 following rules apply:

69th Legislature 2025 SB 426.1
1 (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the
2 name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the
3 beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the
4 same person.
5 (b) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and
6 number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the
7 beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no
8 person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.
9 (3) If a payment order described in subsection (2) is accepted, the originator's payment order
10 described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and the beneficiary's bank pays the person
11 identified by number as permitted by subsection (2)(a), the following rules apply:
12 (a) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.
13 (b) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled
14 to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank
15 proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment
16 order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank
17 account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made
18 by any admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the originator,
19 before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record stating the information to which the notice
20 relates.
21 (4) In a case governed by subsection (2)(a), if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person
22 identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the amount paid
23 may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution as
24 follows:
25 (a) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (3), the originator
26 has the right to recover.
27 (b) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the originator's bank
28 has the right to recover."

3 "30-4A-208. Misdescription of intermediary bank or beneficiary's bank. (1) This subsection
4 applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying
5 number as follows:
6 (a) The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or
7 beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank.
8 (b) The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by
9 the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.
10 (2) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's
11 bank, both by name and an identifying number, if the name and number identify different persons as follows:
12 (a) If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification
13 of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not
14 know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the
15 name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to
16 compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its
17 reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.
18 (b) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment
19 order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of
20 the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name,
21 the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by subsection (2)(a), as though
22 the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies
23 the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record
24 stating the information to which the notice relates.
25 (c) Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the
26 proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the
27 sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need

5 Section 33. Section 30-4A-210, MCA, is amended to read:
6 "30-4A-210. Rejection of payment order. (1) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a
7 notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing a record. A notice of rejection
8 need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or
9 will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means
10 that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable,
11 rejection is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes
12 the means to be used to reject a payment order:
13 (a) any means complying with the agreement is reasonable; and
14 (b) any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice
15 resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.
16 (2) This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a
17 payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized
18 account of the sender sufficient to cover the order. If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order
19 on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to
20 pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date
21 to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to 30-4A-211(4) or the day the sender receives notice or
22 learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day. If the
23 withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest is
24 reduced accordingly.
25 (3) If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to it are
26 considered rejected at the time the bank suspends payments.
27 (4) Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order. Rejection of a payment
28 order precludes a later acceptance of the order."

2 Section 34. Section 30-4A-211, MCA, is amended to read:
3 "30-4A-211. Cancellation and amendment of payment order. (1) A communication of the sender of
4 a payment order canceling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally,
5 electronically, or in writing a record. If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving
6 bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified
7 pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.
8 (2) Subject to subsection (1), a communication by the sender canceling or amending a payment
9 order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a
10 manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank
11 accepts the payment order.
12 (3) After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not
13 effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment
14 without agreement of the bank as follows:
15 (a) With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's
16 bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the
17 payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made.
18 (b) (i) With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or
19 amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order or
20 because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer that resulted in the issuance of a payment order:
21 (A) that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender;
22 (B) that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator; or
23 (C) that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to
24 receive from the originator.
25 (ii) If the payment order is canceled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from
26 the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and

2 (5) A canceled payment order cannot be accepted. If an accepted payment order is canceled, the
3 acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance. Amendment of a
4 payment order is considered to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and issue of a
5 new payment order in the amended form at the same time.
6 (6) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if
7 the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the
8 sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's
9 agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss
10 and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or
11 amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment.
12 (7) A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal incapacity of the sender unless the
13 receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of competent jurisdiction and
14 has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order.
15 (8) A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with subsection (3)(b)."

21 beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided in

23 (2) If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of 30-4A-302 results in
