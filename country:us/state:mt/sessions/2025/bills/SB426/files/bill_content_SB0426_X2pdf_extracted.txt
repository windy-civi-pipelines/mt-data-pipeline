transactions in goods; it does not apply to any transaction which although in the form of an unconditional
contract to sell or present sale is intended to operate only as a security transaction nor does this chapter impair
or repeal any statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers and, in the
case of a hybrid transaction, it applies to the extent provided in subsection (2).
(2) In a hybrid transaction:
(a) if the sale-of-goods aspects do not predominate, only the provisions of this chapter that relate
primarily to the sale-of-goods aspects of the transaction apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to the
transaction as a whole do not apply;
(b) if the sale-of-goods aspects predominate, this chapter applies to the transaction but does not
preclude application in appropriate circumstances of other law to aspects of the transaction that do not relate to
the sale of goods.
(3) This chapter does not:

contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.

an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all obligations which are still executory on
both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.
(4) "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and
its effect is the same as that of "termination" except that the canceling party also retains any remedy for breach
of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.
(5) “Hybrid transaction” means a single transaction involving a sale of goods and:
(a) the provision of services;
(b) a lease of other goods; or
(c) a sale, lease, or license of property other than goods."

Section 11:
section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or
defense unless there is some writing a record sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made
between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by the party's authorized
agent or broker. A writing record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but
the contract is not enforceable under this subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in the writing record.
(2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing record in confirmation of the contract
and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it
satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) against the party unless written notice in a record of objection to its
contents is given within 10 days after it is received.
(3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) but which is valid in other
respects is enforceable:

others in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and
under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial
beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or
(b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in the party's pleading, testimony, or
otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision

Section 12:
Section 9. Section 30-2-202, MCA, is amended to read:

confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing record intended by
the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not
be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be
explained or supplemented:
(a)(1) by course of dealing or usage of trade ( 30-1-205) or by course of performance ( 30-2-208);
and
(b)(2) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been
intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement."

Section 13:
Section 10. Section 30-2-203, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-2-203. Seals inoperative. The affixing of a seal to a writing record evidencing a contract for sale
or an offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the writing record a sealed instrument and the law with
respect to sealed instruments does not apply to such a contract or offer."

months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the
offeror."

Section 15:
Section 12. Section 30-2-209, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-2-209. Modification, rescission and waiver. (1) An agreement modifying a contract within this
chapter needs no consideration to be binding.
(2) A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing or
other signed record cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a
requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.
(3) The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this chapter ( 30-2-201) must be satisfied if
the contract as modified is within its provisions.
(4) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of
subsection (2) or (3) it can operate as a waiver.
(5) A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may retract the
waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term
waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver."

(b) there is a writing record, signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by that
party's authorized agent, sufficient to indicate that a lease contract has been made between the parties and to
describe the goods leased and the lease term.
(2) Any description of leased goods or of the lease term is sufficient and satisfies subsection (1)(b),
whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described.
(3) A writing record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon, but
the lease contract is not enforceable under subsection (1)(b) beyond the lease term and the quantity of goods
shown in the writing record.
(4) A lease contract that does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1), but which is valid in
other respects, is enforceable:
(a) if the goods are to be specially manufactured or obtained for the lessee and are not suitable for
lease or sale to others in the ordinary course of the lessor's business and the lessor, before notice of
repudiation is received and under circumstances that reasonably indicate that the goods are for the lessee, has
made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement;
(b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony, or
otherwise in court that a lease contract was made but the lease contract is not enforceable under this provision
beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or

record may not be otherwise modified or rescinded, but, except as between merchants, such a requirement on
a form supplied by a merchant must be separately signed by the other party.
(3) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of
subsection (2), it may operate as a waiver.
(4) A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of a lease contract may retract
the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any
term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the

Section 31:
Section 28. Section 30-4A-201, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-201. Security procedure. "Security procedure" means a procedure established by agreement
of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of verifying that a payment order or communication
amending or canceling a payment order is that of the customer or detecting error in the transmission or the
content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an obligation on the
receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words, or
numbers, symbols, sounds, biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.
Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the
customer or requiring a payment order to be sent from a known e-mail address, IP address, or telephone
number is not by itself a security procedure."

Section 32:
Section 29. Section 30-4A-202, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-202. Authorized and verified payment orders. (1) A payment order received by the
receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is
otherwise bound by it under the law of agency.
(2) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the
bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order
received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if the
security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment
orders and the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the bank's
obligations under the security procedure and any written agreement or instruction of the customer, evidenced
by a record, restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not
required to follow an instruction that violates a written an agreement with the customer, evidenced by a record,
or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act
on it before the payment order is accepted.
(3) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by
considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the
bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank,
alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers
and receiving banks similarly situated. A security procedure is considered to be commercially reasonable if:
(a) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer
refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer; and
(b) the customer expressly agreed in writing a record to be bound by any payment order, whether
or not authorized, issued in the customer's name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank's
obligation under the security procedure chosen by the customer.
(4) The term "sender" in this chapter includes the customer in whose name a payment order is
issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection (1) or if it is effective as the order of
the customer under subsection (2).
(5) This section applies to amendments and cancellations of payment orders to the same extent it

applies to payment orders.
(6) Except as provided in this section and in 30-4A-203(1)(a), rights and obligations arising under
this section or 30-4A-203 may not be varied by agreement."

Section 33:
Section 30. Section 30-4A-203, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-203. Unenforceability of certain verified payment orders. (1) If an accepted payment order
is not, under 30-4A-202(1), an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective as an order
of the customer pursuant to 30-4A-202(2), the following rules apply:
(a) By express written agreement evidenced by a record, the receiving bank may limit the extent to
which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order.
(b) (i) The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the
customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person:
(A) entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the
security procedure; or
(B) who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source
controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the
security procedure, regardless of how the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault.
(ii) Information includes any access device, computer software, or the like.
(2) This section applies to amendments of payment orders to the same extent it applies to
payment orders."

received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number, or other identification of the beneficiary
refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order
and acceptance of the order cannot occur.
(2) If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name
and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the
- 30 - Authorized Print Version – SB 426
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 426
following rules apply:
(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the
name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the
beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the
same person.
(b) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and
number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the
beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no
person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.
(3) If a payment order described in subsection (2) is accepted, the originator's payment order
described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and the beneficiary's bank pays the person
identified by number as permitted by subsection (2)(a), the following rules apply:
(a) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.
(b) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled
to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank
proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment
order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank
account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made
by any admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the originator,
before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record stating the information to which the notice
relates.
(4) In a case governed by subsection (2)(a), if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person
identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the amount paid
may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution as
follows:
(a) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (3), the originator
has the right to recover.
(b) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the originator's bank

has the right to recover."

Section 35:
Section 32. Section 30-4A-208, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-208. Misdescription of intermediary bank or beneficiary's bank. (1) This subsection
applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying
number as follows:
(a) The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or
beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank.
(b) The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by
the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.
(2) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's
bank, both by name and an identifying number, if the name and number identify different persons as follows:
(a) If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification
of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not
know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the
name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to
compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its
reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.
(b) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment
order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of
the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name,
the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by subsection (2)(a), as though
the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies
the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record
stating the information to which the notice relates.
(c) Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the
proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the
sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need

not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.
(d) If the receiving bank knows that the name and number identify different persons, reliance on
either the name or the number in executing the sender's payment order is a breach of the obligation stated in
30-4A-302(1)(a)."

Section 36:
Section 33. Section 30-4A-210, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-210. Rejection of payment order. (1) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a
notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing a record. A notice of rejection
need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or
will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means
that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable,
rejection is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes
the means to be used to reject a payment order:
(a) any means complying with the agreement is reasonable; and
(b) any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice
resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.
(2) This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a
payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized
account of the sender sufficient to cover the order. If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order
on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to
pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date
to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to 30-4A-211(4) or the day the sender receives notice or
learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day. If the
withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest is
reduced accordingly.
(3) If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to it are
considered rejected at the time the bank suspends payments.
(4) Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order. Rejection of a payment

order precludes a later acceptance of the order."

Section 37:
Section 34. Section 30-4A-211, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-211. Cancellation and amendment of payment order. (1) A communication of the sender of
a payment order canceling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally,
electronically, or in writing a record. If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving
bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified
pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.
(2) Subject to subsection (1), a communication by the sender canceling or amending a payment
order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a
manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank
accepts the payment order.
(3) After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not
effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment
without agreement of the bank as follows:
(a) With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's
bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the
payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made.
(b) (i) With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or
amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order or
because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer that resulted in the issuance of a payment order:
(A) that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender;
(B) that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator; or
(C) that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to
receive from the originator.
(ii) If the payment order is canceled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from
the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and
restitution.

69th Legislature 2025 SB 426
(4) An unaccepted payment order is canceled by operation of law at the close of the fifth funds-
transfer business day of the receiving bank after the execution date or payment date of the order.
(5) A canceled payment order cannot be accepted. If an accepted payment order is canceled, the
acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance. Amendment of a
payment order is considered to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and issue of a
new payment order in the amended form at the same time.
(6) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if
the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the
sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's
agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss
and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or
amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment.
(7) A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal incapacity of the sender unless the
receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of competent jurisdiction and
has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order.
(8) A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with subsection (3)(b)."

Section 38:
Section 35. Section 30-4A-305, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-305. Liability for late or improper execution or failure to execute payment order. (1) If a
funds transfer is completed but execution of a payment order by the receiving bank in breach of 30-4A-302
results in delay in payment to the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to pay interest to either the originator or the
beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided in
subsection (3), additional damages are not recoverable.
(2) If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of 30-4A-302 results in
noncompletion of the funds transfer, failure to use an intermediary bank designated by the originator, or
issuance of a payment order that does not comply with the terms of the payment order of the originator, the
bank is liable to the originator for its expenses in the funds transfer and for incidental expenses and interest
losses, to the extent not covered by subsection (1), resulting from the improper execution. Except as provided
- 35 - Authorized Print Version – SB 426

in subsection (3), additional damages are not recoverable.
(3) In addition to the amounts payable under subsections (1) and (2), damages, including
consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the
receiving bank, evidenced by a record.
(4) If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment order it was obliged by express agreement to
execute, the receiving bank is liable to the sender for its expenses in the transaction and for incidental
expenses and interest losses resulting from the failure to execute. Additional damages, including consequential
damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank,
evidenced by a record, but are not otherwise recoverable.
(5) Reasonable attorney fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (1) or
(2) is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim. If a claim is made for breach of an agreement
under subsection (4) and the agreement does not provide for damages, reasonable attorney fees are
recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (4) is made and refused before an action is brought
on the claim.
(6) Except as stated in this section, the liability of a receiving bank under subsections (1) and (2)
may not be varied by agreement."

Section 40:
Section 37. Section 30-5-136, MCA, is amended to read:

(2) Unless subsection (1) applies, the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action
or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the person is located. The person is considered
to be located at the address indicated in the person's undertaking. If more than one address is indicated, the
person is considered to be located at the address from which the person's undertaking was issued.
(3) For the purpose of jurisdiction, choice of law, and recognition of interbranch letters of credit, but
not enforcement of a judgment, all branches of a bank are considered separate juridical entities and a bank is
considered to be located at the place where its relevant branch is considered to be located under this
subsection (4).
(4) A branch of a bank is considered to be located at the address indicated in the branch’s
undertaking. If more than one address is indicated, the branch is considered to be located at the address from
which the undertaking was issued.
(3)(5) (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the liability of an issuer, nominated person,
or adviser is governed by any rules of custom or practice, such as the Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits, to which the letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking is expressly made subject.
(b) The rules of custom and practice govern except to the extent of any conflict with the
nonvariable provisions specified in 30-5-123(3) if:
(i) this chapter would govern the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser under
subsection (1) or (2);
(ii) the relevant undertaking incorporates rules of custom or practice; and
(iii) there is conflict between this chapter and those rules as applied to that undertaking.
(4)(6) If there is conflict between this chapter and chapter 3, 4, 4A, or 9A, this chapter governs.

"30-1-301. Territorial applicability -- parties power to choose applicable law. (1) Except as
otherwise provided in this section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to this state and also to
another state or nation, the parties may agree that the law either of this state or of the other state or nation shall
govern their rights and duties.
(2) In the absence of an agreement effective under subsection (1) and except as provided in

(h) [Section 100]."
Section 6. Section 30-2-102, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-2-102. Scope -- certain security and other transactions excluded from this chapter. (1)
Unless the context otherwise requires, and except as provided in subsection (3), this chapter applies to
transactions in goods; it does not apply to any transaction which although in the form of an unconditional
contract to sell or present sale is intended to operate only as a security transaction nor does this chapter impair
or repeal any statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers and, in the
case of a hybrid transaction, it applies to the extent provided in subsection (2).
(2) In a hybrid transaction:
(a) if the sale-of-goods aspects do not predominate, only the provisions of this chapter that relate
primarily to the sale-of-goods aspects of the transaction apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to the
transaction as a whole do not apply;
(b) if the sale-of-goods aspects predominate, this chapter applies to the transaction but does not
preclude application in appropriate circumstances of other law to aspects of the transaction that do not relate to
the sale of goods.
(3) This chapter does not:
(a) apply to a transaction that, even though in the form of an unconditional contract to sell or
present sale, operates only to create a security interest; or
(b) impair or repeal a statute regulating sales to consumers, farmers, or other specified classes of
buyers."
Section 7. Section 30-2-106, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-2-106. Definitions -- "contract" -- "agreement" -- "contract for sale" -- "sale" -- "present
sale" -- "conforming" to contract -- "termination" -- "cancellation" -- "hybrid transaction". (1) In this
chapter unless the context otherwise requires "contract" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the
present or future sale of goods. "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell
- 9 - Authorized Print Version – SB 426

69th Legislature 2025 SB 426
goods at a future time. A "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price ( 30-2-
401). A "present sale" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.
(2) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are "conforming" or conform to the
contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.
(3) "Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts
an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all obligations which are still executory on
both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.
(4) "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and
its effect is the same as that of "termination" except that the canceling party also retains any remedy for breach
of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.
(5) “Hybrid transaction” means a single transaction involving a sale of goods and:
(a) the provision of services;
(b) a lease of other goods; or
(c) a sale, lease, or license of property other than goods."
Section 8. Section 30-2-201, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-2-201. Formal requirements -- statute of frauds. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this
section a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or
defense unless there is some writing a record sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made
between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by the party's authorized
agent or broker. A writing record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but
the contract is not enforceable under this subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in the writing record.
(2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing record in confirmation of the contract

others in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and
under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial
beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or

(b) there is a writing record, signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by that
party's authorized agent, sufficient to indicate that a lease contract has been made between the parties and to

(2) Any description of leased goods or of the lease term is sufficient and satisfies subsection (1)(b),
whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described.
(3) A writing record is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon, but
the lease contract is not enforceable under subsection (1)(b) beyond the lease term and the quantity of goods

(4) A lease contract that does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1), but which is valid in
other respects, is enforceable:

of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of verifying that a payment order or communication
amending or canceling a payment order is that of the customer or detecting error in the transmission or the
content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an obligation on the
receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words, or
numbers, symbols, sounds, biometrics, encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices.
Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the
customer or requiring a payment order to be sent from a known e-mail address, IP address, or telephone
number is not by itself a security procedure."

Section 29. Section 30-4A-202, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-202. Authorized and verified payment orders. (1) A payment order received by the
receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is
otherwise bound by it under the law of agency.
(2) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the
bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order
received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if the
security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment
orders and the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the bank's
obligations under the security procedure and any written agreement or instruction of the customer, evidenced
by a record, restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not
required to follow an instruction that violates a written an agreement with the customer, evidenced by a record,
or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act
on it before the payment order is accepted.
(3) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by
considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the
bank, including the size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank,
alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and security procedures in general use by customers
and receiving banks similarly situated. A security procedure is considered to be commercially reasonable if:
(a) the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer
refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer; and
(b) the customer expressly agreed in writing a record to be bound by any payment order, whether
or not authorized, issued in the customer's name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank's
obligation under the security procedure chosen by the customer.
(4) The term "sender" in this chapter includes the customer in whose name a payment order is
issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection (1) or if it is effective as the order of
the customer under subsection (2).
(5) This section applies to amendments and cancellations of payment orders to the same extent it

69th Legislature 2025 SB 426
applies to payment orders.
(6) Except as provided in this section and in 30-4A-203(1)(a), rights and obligations arising under
this section or 30-4A-203 may not be varied by agreement."
Section 30. Section 30-4A-203, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-203. Unenforceability of certain verified payment orders. (1) If an accepted payment order
is not, under 30-4A-202(1), an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective as an order
of the customer pursuant to 30-4A-202(2), the following rules apply:
(a) By express written agreement evidenced by a record, the receiving bank may limit the extent to
which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order.
(b) (i) The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the
customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person:
(A) entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the
security procedure; or
(B) who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source
controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the
security procedure, regardless of how the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault.
(ii) Information includes any access device, computer software, or the like.
(2) This section applies to amendments of payment orders to the same extent it applies to
payment orders."
Section 31. Section 30-4A-207, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-207. Misdescription of beneficiary. (1) Subject to subsection (2), if, in a payment order
received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number, or other identification of the beneficiary
refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order
and acceptance of the order cannot occur.
(2) If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name
and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the
- 30 - Authorized Print Version – SB 426
ENROLLED BILL

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 426
following rules apply:
(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3), if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the
name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the
beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the
same person.
(b) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and
number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the
beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no
person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.
(3) If a payment order described in subsection (2) is accepted, the originator's payment order
described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number, and the beneficiary's bank pays the person
identified by number as permitted by subsection (2)(a), the following rules apply:
(a) If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.
(b) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled
to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank
proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment
order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank
account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made
by any admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the originator,
before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record stating the information to which the notice
relates.
(4) In a case governed by subsection (2)(a), if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person
identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the amount paid
may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution as
follows:
(a) If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection (3), the originator
has the right to recover.
(b) If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the originator's bank

has the right to recover."
Section 32. Section 30-4A-208, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-208. Misdescription of intermediary bank or beneficiary's bank. (1) This subsection
applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying
number as follows:
(a) The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or
beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank.
(b) The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by
the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.
(2) This subsection applies to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's
bank, both by name and an identifying number, if the name and number identify different persons as follows:
(a) If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification
of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not
know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the
name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to
compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its
reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.
(b) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment
order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of
the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name,
the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by subsection (2)(a), as though
the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies
the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record
stating the information to which the notice relates.
(c) Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the
proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the
sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need

not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.
(d) If the receiving bank knows that the name and number identify different persons, reliance on
either the name or the number in executing the sender's payment order is a breach of the obligation stated in
30-4A-302(1)(a)."
Section 33. Section 30-4A-210, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-210. Rejection of payment order. (1) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a
notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing a record. A notice of rejection
need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or
will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means
that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable,
rejection is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes
the means to be used to reject a payment order:
(a) any means complying with the agreement is reasonable; and
(b) any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice
resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.
(2) This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a
payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized
account of the sender sufficient to cover the order. If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order
on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to
pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date
to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to 30-4A-211(4) or the day the sender receives notice or
learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day. If the
withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest is
reduced accordingly.
(3) If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to it are
considered rejected at the time the bank suspends payments.
(4) Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order. Rejection of a payment

order precludes a later acceptance of the order."
Section 34. Section 30-4A-211, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-211. Cancellation and amendment of payment order. (1) A communication of the sender of
a payment order canceling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally,
electronically, or in writing a record. If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving
bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified
pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.
(2) Subject to subsection (1), a communication by the sender canceling or amending a payment
order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a
manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank
accepts the payment order.
(3) After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not
effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment
without agreement of the bank as follows:
(a) With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's
bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the
payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made.
(b) (i) With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or
amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order or
because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer that resulted in the issuance of a payment order:
(A) that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender;
(B) that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator; or
(C) that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to
receive from the originator.
(ii) If the payment order is canceled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from
the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and
restitution.

69th Legislature 2025 SB 426
(4) An unaccepted payment order is canceled by operation of law at the close of the fifth funds-
transfer business day of the receiving bank after the execution date or payment date of the order.
(5) A canceled payment order cannot be accepted. If an accepted payment order is canceled, the
acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance. Amendment of a
payment order is considered to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and issue of a
new payment order in the amended form at the same time.
(6) Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if
the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the
sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's
agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss
and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or
amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment.
(7) A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal incapacity of the sender unless the
receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of competent jurisdiction and
has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order.
(8) A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with subsection (3)(b)."
Section 35. Section 30-4A-305, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-4A-305. Liability for late or improper execution or failure to execute payment order. (1) If a
funds transfer is completed but execution of a payment order by the receiving bank in breach of 30-4A-302
results in delay in payment to the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to pay interest to either the originator or the
beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided in
subsection (3), additional damages are not recoverable.
(2) If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of 30-4A-302 results in
noncompletion of the funds transfer, failure to use an intermediary bank designated by the originator, or
issuance of a payment order that does not comply with the terms of the payment order of the originator, the
bank is liable to the originator for its expenses in the funds transfer and for incidental expenses and interest
losses, to the extent not covered by subsection (1), resulting from the improper execution. Except as provided

in subsection (3), additional damages are not recoverable.
(3) In addition to the amounts payable under subsections (1) and (2), damages, including
consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the
receiving bank, evidenced by a record.
(4) If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment order it was obliged by express agreement to
execute, the receiving bank is liable to the sender for its expenses in the transaction and for incidental
expenses and interest losses resulting from the failure to execute. Additional damages, including consequential
damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank,
evidenced by a record, but are not otherwise recoverable.
(5) Reasonable attorney fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (1) or
(2) is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim. If a claim is made for breach of an agreement
under subsection (4) and the agreement does not provide for damages, reasonable attorney fees are
recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection (4) is made and refused before an action is brought
on the claim.
(6) Except as stated in this section, the liability of a receiving bank under subsections (1) and (2)
may not be varied by agreement."
Section 36. Section 30-5-124, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-5-124. Formal requirements. A letter of credit, confirmation, advice, transfer, amendment, or
cancellation may be issued in any form that is a signed record and is authenticated:
(1) by a signature; or
(2) in accordance with the agreement of the parties or the standard practice referred to in 30-5-
128(5)."
Section 37. Section 30-5-136, MCA, is amended to read:
"30-5-136. Choice of law and forum. (1) The liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for

signed or otherwise authenticated by the affected parties in the manner provided in 30-5-124or by a provision in

(2) Unless subsection (1) applies, the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action
or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the person is located. The person is considered
to be located at the address indicated in the person's undertaking. If more than one address is indicated, the
person is considered to be located at the address from which the person's undertaking was issued.
(3) For the purpose of jurisdiction, choice of law, and recognition of interbranch letters of credit, but
not enforcement of a judgment, all branches of a bank are considered separate juridical entities and a bank is
considered to be located at the place where its relevant branch is considered to be located under this
subsection (4).
(4) A branch of a bank is considered to be located at the address indicated in the branch’s
undertaking. If more than one address is indicated, the branch is considered to be located at the address from
which the undertaking was issued.
(3)(5) (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the liability of an issuer, nominated person,
or adviser is governed by any rules of custom or practice, such as the Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits, to which the letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking is expressly made subject.
(b) The rules of custom and practice govern except to the extent of any conflict with the
nonvariable provisions specified in 30-5-123(3) if:
(i) this chapter would govern the liability of an issuer, nominated person, or adviser under
subsection (1) or (2);
(ii) the relevant undertaking incorporates rules of custom or practice; and
(iii) there is conflict between this chapter and those rules as applied to that undertaking.
(4)(6) If there is conflict between this chapter and chapter 3, 4, 4A, or 9A, this chapter governs.
(5)(7) The forum for settling disputes arising out of an undertaking within this chapter may be chosen
in the manner and with the binding effect that governing law may be chosen in accordance with subsection (1)."

purposes.
(4) In a consumer transaction, if a record evidences the account debtor's obligation, law other than
this chapter requires that the record provide a statement to the effect that the account debtor's recovery against
an assignee with respect to claims and defenses against the assignor may not exceed amounts paid by the
account debtor under the record, and the record does not provide such a statement, the extent to which a claim

after, the account debtor receives a notification, authenticated signed by the assignor or the assignee, that the
amount due or to become due has been assigned and that payment is to be made to the assignee. After receipt
of the notification, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignee and may not
discharge the obligation by paying the assignor.

complies, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignor, even if the account debtor

of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right
of termination, or remedy under the account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note.
(5) Subsection (4) does not apply to the sale of a payment intangible or promissory note, other
