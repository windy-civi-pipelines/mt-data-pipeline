4 (i) a person born with external biological sex characteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous,

18 chromosomes and produces or would produce relatively large, relatively immobile gametes, or eggs, during her
19 life cycle and has a reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An
20 individual who would otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is female for

23 female.
