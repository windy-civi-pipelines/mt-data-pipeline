1 Subsections (4)(a) and (4)(b) do not apply for other purposes, including:
2 (a) treatment for a person born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development, including:
3 (i) a person born with external biological sex characteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous,
4 including an individual born with 46 XX chromosomes with virilization, an individual born with 46 XY
5 chromosomes with undervirilization, or an individual having both ovarian and testicular tissue; and
6 (ii) a person whom a physician has otherwise diagnosed with a disorder of sexual development in
7 which the physician has determined through genetic or biochemical testing that the person does not have
8 normal sex chromosome structure, sex steroid hormone production, or sex steroid hormone action for a male or
9 female; and
10 (b) treatment of any infection, injury, disease, or disorder that has been caused or exacerbated by
11 a medical treatment listed in subsection (4)(a) or (4)(b), whether or not the medical treatment was performed in
12 accordance with state and federal law and whether or not funding for the medical treatment is permissible
13 under state and federal law.
14 (6) As used in this section, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the following definitions
15 apply:
16 (a) "Female" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XX
17 chromosomes and produces or would produce relatively large, relatively immobile gametes, or eggs, during her
18 life cycle and has a reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An
19 individual who would otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is female for
20 the purposes of this section.
21 (b) "Gender" means the psychological, behavioral, social, and cultural aspects of being male or
22 female.
23 (c) "Health care professional" means a person who is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized
24 by the laws of this state to administer health care in the ordinary course of the practice of the person's
25 profession.

27 chromosomes and produces or would produce small, mobile gametes, or sperm, during his life cycle and has a
28 reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An individual who would

1 otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is male for the purposes of this
2 section.
3 (e) "Physician" means a person who is licensed to practice medicine in this state.
4 (f) "Sex" means the organization of body parts and gametes for reproduction in human beings and
5 other organisms. In human beings, there are exactly two sexes, male and female, with two corresponding types
6 of gametes. The sexes are determined by the biological and genetic indication of male or female, including sex
7 chromosomes, naturally occurring sex chromosomes, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and external
8 genitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual's psychological, behavioral, social, cultural, chosen, or
