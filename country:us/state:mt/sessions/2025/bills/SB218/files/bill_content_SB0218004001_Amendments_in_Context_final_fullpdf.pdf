1 (ii) a person whom a physician has otherwise diagnosed with a disorder of sexual development in
2 which the physician has determined through genetic or biochemical testing that the person does not have
3 normal sex chromosome structure, sex steroid hormone production, or sex steroid hormone action for a male or
4 female; and and
5 (b) treatment of any infection, injury, disease, or disorder that has been caused or exacerbated by
6 a medical treatment listed in subsection (4)(a) or (4)(b), whether or not the medical treatment was performed in

8 under state and federal law.; OR
9 (C) ANY OTHER CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE OR EVIDENCE-BASED BASIS FOR THE TREATMENT.
10 (6) As used in this section, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the following definitions
11 apply:
12 (a) "Female" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XX
13 chromosomes and produces or would produce relatively large, relatively immobile gametes, or eggs, during her
14 life cycle and has a reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An
15 individual who would otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is female for
16 the purposes of this section, when used to refer to a natural person, an individual who naturally has, had, will
17 have, or would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive
18 system that at some point produces, transports, and utilizes the large gamete, or ova, for fertilization.
19 (b) "Gender" means the psychological, behavioral, social, and cultural aspects of being male or
20 female, when the term is used alone to refer to a male, female, or the natural differences between a male and
21 female:
22 (i) may not be considered a synonym for sex;
23 (ii) may not be considered a synonym or short-hand expression for gender identity, experienced
24 gender, gender expression, or gender role; and
25 (iii) does not apply when it is used in conjunction with other words or as an adjective to modify
26 other words, or when context or explicit definition in preexisting state law, administrative rules, or guidelines
27 indicate otherwise.
28 (c) "Health care professional" means a person who is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized

1 by the laws of this state to administer health care in the ordinary course of the practice of the person's
2 profession.
3 (d) "Male" means a member of the human species who, under normal development, has XY
4 chromosomes and produces or would produce small, mobile gametes, or sperm, during his life cycle and has a
5 reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An individual who would
6 otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is male for the purposes of this
7 section, when the term is used to refer to a natural person, an individual who naturally has, had, will have, or
8 would have, but for a congenital anomaly or intentional or unintentional disruption, the reproductive system that
9 at some point produces, transports, and utilizes the small gamete, or sperm, for fertilization.
10 (e) "Physician" means a person who is licensed to practice medicine in this state.
11 (f) "Sex" means the organization of body parts and gametes for reproduction in human beings and
12 other organisms. In human beings, there are exactly two sexes, male and female, with two corresponding types
13 of gametes. The sexes are determined by the biological and genetic indication of male or female, including sex
14 chromosomes, naturally occurring sex chromosomes, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and external
15 genitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual's psychological, behavioral, social, cultural, chosen, or
16 subjective experience of gender whether someone is male or female, which is distinguished based on the type
17 of gamete, sperm or eggs, they are capable of or expected to produce, as dictated by their primary sexual
18 anatomy. Because there are only two types of gametes, sperm and ova, with two corresponding reproductive
19 systems, there are only two sexes: male and female. An individual’s sex is rooted in reproductive anatomy and
20 is in no way influenced or defined by one’s psychological state, behavior, expression, or personal identity.

9 under the age of 4 on the date of the minor's injury, the period of limitations in subsection (1) begins to run
10 when the minor reaches the minor's eighth birthday or dies, whichever occurs first, and the time for
11 commencement of the action is tolled during any period during which the minor does not reside with a parent or
12 guardian.
13 (3) (a) In an action brought for an injury described in [section 1], the time limitation in subsection
14 (1) is tolled until the plaintiff reaches the age of 30 or until the plaintiff discovers both the injury and the causal
15 relationship between the medical treatment and the injury, whichever is later.
16 (b) The time limitations in this section and in [section 1] for an injury described in [section 1] do not
17 prohibit a plaintiff from commencing an action before the plaintiff reaches the age of 30."
