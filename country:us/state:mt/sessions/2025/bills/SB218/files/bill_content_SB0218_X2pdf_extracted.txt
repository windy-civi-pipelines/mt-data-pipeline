including:
(a) treatment for a person born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development, including:
(i) a person born with external biological sex characteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous,
including an individual born with 46 XX chromosomes with virilization, an individual born with 46 XY

chromosomes and produces or would produce relatively large, relatively immobile gametes, or eggs, during her
life cycle and has a reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of those gametes. An
individual who would otherwise fall within this definition, but for a biological or genetic condition, is female for

(f) "Sex" means the organization of body parts and gametes for reproduction in human beings and
other organisms. In human beings, there are exactly two sexes, male and female, with two corresponding types

genitalia present at birth, without regard to an individual's psychological, behavioral, social, cultural, chosen, or
subjective experience of gender.

period during which there has been a failure to disclose any act, error, or omission upon which an action is
based and that is known to the defendant or through the use of reasonable diligence subsequent to the act,
error, or omission would have been known to the defendant.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-2-401, in an action for death or injury of a minor who was
under the age of 4 on the date of the minor's injury, the period of limitations in subsection (1) begins to run
when the minor reaches the minor's eighth birthday or dies, whichever occurs first, and the time for
