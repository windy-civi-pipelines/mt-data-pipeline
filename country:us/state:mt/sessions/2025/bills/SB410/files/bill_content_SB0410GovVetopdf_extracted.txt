Re: S.B. 410 – Veto Request
Governor Gianforte:
potential unintended consequences this legislation may have on access to clinical research trials for the
citizens of Montana.
We understand Senator Zolnikov’s sincere intentions behind this bill and the need to protect the
genomic information of Montanans. However, we fear that, as written, S.B. 410 will limit or possibly
eliminate much of the medical research conducted by our facilities. Provisions within the bill limit the
ability to access genetic information from outside of the United States and prohibit the storage of such
data outside of the US. Much of the research done by Billings Clinic revolves around industry trials
which involve some component of genetic information. As the field of medicine moves towards
personalized precision care, we have become more dependent on genomic data to guide individual
treatment plans. These studies are generally international in nature, meaning that there is a high
probability that some genetic information is being stored and or accessed from outside the United
States.
Examples of research done by Billings Clinic, likely to be impacted, include the following:
 Billings Clinic is currently participating in a cystic fibrosis study that involves sending samples to
Italy. While this study only has a few participants in MT, it is impactful to their quality of life.
 Novartis, based in Switzerland, is one of our primary sponsors of research at Billings Clinic. We
are currently participating in a Multiple Sclerosis trial with a small number of patients.
 We are currently screening candidates for a consortium study involving breast cancer that
requires us to send tissue to Canada.
 One recently completed international study looked at early detection of cancer, offering high-
risk individuals who have a family or personal history of cancer access to genetic testing for
cancer susceptibility mutations in a randomized trial. This trial included more than 5500 Billings
Clinic primary care patients.
In addition to those listed above, Billings Clinic participates in multiple studies in Oncology, Cardiology,
Neurology, Infectious Disease and other specialties. We have also participated in studies where patients
from other countries travel to us to participate in a study. These clinical trials allow our patients early
access to cutting edge treatments which often become standards of care after completion of the trial.
Many of these patients have exhausted other treatment options and these trials offer new hope to the
Montanans we serve. SB 410 would severely impede our ability to do this work. Patients will likely be
forced to choose between traveling to major metropolitan areas in other states such as Denver or
Seattle or forgoing participation altogether.
Senator Zolnikov was gracious enough to come to Billings Clinic and meet with us regarding our
concerns. We have committed to collaborating with him to fine tune the bill language in the interim to
address the unintended consequences and produce a bill for next session that protects the genomic
information of Montanans while allowing the valuable international collaborations around critical
medical research.
Thank you for your consideration of our veto request.

Re: S.B. 410 – Veto Request
Governor Gianforte:
Johnson & Johnson (J&J) respectfully urges you to veto S.B. 410 due to the potential
unintended consequences that its implementation may have on both clinical research
and patient care.
We recognize and appreciate the sponsor’s intent and concern regarding the utilization
of foreign genetic sequencers. However, other provisions of S.B. 410, as passed by the
legislature, would severely restrict the ability of companies to collaborate in research
with international partners, including Canada. The potential signing of this legislation
could hinder innovation, stall investment, and result in negative outcomes for patients in
Montana.
Our primary concern lies in the data storage and access stipulations in Section 5, which
mandates that “all genetic sequencing data from the state must be restricted to the
geographic location of the United States. Except for open data, genetic sequencing data
from the state may not be accessed remotely from outside the United States unless
explicit written approval is obtained from the individuals whose data would be accessed.”
Cutting edge biomedical research requires collaboration between some of the world's
most knowledgeable scientists and physicians and consequently requires international
collaboration among experts. At Johnson & Johnson, we take seriously the security of
our research participants’ data, and comply with a complex series of laws, regulations,
and professional and company standards and policies to ensure protection of sensitive
data. If enacted, we have concerns about our ability to continue to conduct cancer-
related research in Montana.
We propose an amendment that would restrict genetic sequencing data storage and
access specifically in foreign adversary countries. This amendment would facilitate
ongoing research collaborations with international partners while preventing the sharing
of genetic sequencing data with foreign adversaries, aligning with what we believe is the
original intent of the bill. Similar language has already been integrated into legislation in
several states, including Utah, Texas, Kansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Arkansas.
In line with this approach, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a final rule on January
8, 2025, which addresses the safeguarding of Americans’ personal data from “countries
of concern” as mandated by Executive Order 14117. This rule prohibits the transfer of
bulk sensitive data, including genetic information, to China and other designated
countries of concern. Importantly, even in those instances, the DOJ rule incorporates
carefully tailored exceptions to ensure that Americans’ access to health care is not
needlessly impacted as a result of these restrictions. These exceptions are not included
in Senate Bill 410.
Lastly, we have concerns regarding Section 6 (Penalties for non-compliance) in that
cutting-edge healthcare companies may be forced to invest their clinical research,
precision medicine and advanced technology dollars in states where doing so does not
risk a significant monetary penalty each and every time data is accessed to do their job
to advance patient care.
In conclusion, if enacted, this legislation may position Montana as an outlier and lead to
unintended consequences that could negatively impact critical, lifesaving research and
patient treatment options.
For these reasons, we respectfully request that you consider vetoing Senate Bill 410.
Thank you for considering our perspective.

Re: SB 410 – Veto Request
Governor Gianforte:
This correspondence will serve as a follow up to our initial letter dated May 12, 2025,
which respectfully requested your veto of SB 410 due to the potential unintended
consequences that its implementation may have on both clinical research and patient
care.
We appreciated the opportunity to meet with Rachel Green and Mark Blasdel on May 27,
2025, and hope that the information contained in this letter will offer some additional
follow up information regarding some excellent questions raised during our discussion.
As we stated in our initial letter, we very much appreciate the sponsor’s intent and
concern regarding the utilization of foreign genetic sequencers, as we take the protection
of patient data to be of the utmost importance. While SB 410 would establish that
genetic sequencing data must be secured by “reasonable encryption methods,
restrictions on access, and other cybersecurity best practices,” Montanans can rest
assured that existing state and federal law already protect their genetic data to this
standard.
• Section 7(b) of the Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act already requires that
a company "(b) establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative,
technical, and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality,
integrity, and accessibility of personal data appropriate to the volume and nature
of the personal data at issue." Genetic data is universally considered to be
among the most sensitive types of data, subject to the highest security
requirements. The Attorney General is empowered to enforce this law.
• At the federal level, most genetic data collected by and through health care
providers is covered by the HIPAA Security Rule, which is widely regarded as
among the most strict and prescriptive security standards. In addition, the FTC
regularly brings enforcement actions under Section 5 of the FTC Act against
companies for failing to secure health data, including genetic data.
Moreover, at both the state and federal level, breach notification laws place significant
pressure on companies to secure genetic and other health data in order to avoid the
consequences of a data breach. Indeed, when a data breach occurs, companies must
notify individuals, State regulators, and Federal regulators, giving rise to enforcement
risks and class actions.
Lastly, it is important to note that US Department of Justice published a Final Rule (28
CFR Part 202 "Access to U.S. Sensitive Personal Data and Government-related
Data by Countries of Concern or Covered Persons," which was made effective on
April 18, 2025) which criminalizes the transfer of covered genetic data (100 records or
more) to countries of concern and individuals working in those countries or for
companies domiciled there. This means that – with certain narrow exceptions, including
importantly for FDA-regulated clinical trial activity – existing federal regulations already
prohibit the sharing of genetic data of Montanans with people in adversarial countries.”
If SB 410 is signed into law, these restrictions will extend to non-adversarial countries,
including Canada and the European Union, and to contexts where such restrictions are
likely NOT in the best interest of those whose data is being used (eg, clinical trials).
Attached to this letter is a spreadsheet created from clinicaltrials.gov which lists all
planned and currently enrolling clinical trials (n=258), as well as recently completed
studies (n=2,724), which include patients and sites in Montana. These are examples of
clinical research (and patient care) that will – very unfortunately - be at risk to
continue/move to completion upon the enactment of SB 410 (or are examples of studies
in Montana that would have been impacted by enactment).
Lastly, in our previous correspondence, we noted our commitment to work with the bill
sponsor on an amendment that would restrict genetic sequencing data storage and
access specifically in foreign adversary countries but would allow for ongoing research
collaborations with international partners. We mentioned several states’ legislative
activity in our May 12, 2025 correspondence that could be considered, but one specific
example for reference is Tennessee (HB25-395), which was enacted on April 4, 2025.
68-30-205. (a) A medical facility or research facility shall not store genetic
sequencing data within a foreign adversary. The medical facility or research
facility shall not allow remote access to genetic sequencing data storage within
its direction or control, other than open data, to a foreign adversary, unless
approved in writing by the commissioner of health.
Cutting edge biomedical research requires collaboration between some of the world's
most knowledgeable scientists and physicians and consequently requires international
collaboration among experts. At Johnson & Johnson, we take seriously the security of
our research participants’ data, and comply with a complex existing series of laws,
regulations, and professional and company standards and policies to ensure protection
2
of sensitive data. If enacted, we have concerns about our ability to continue to conduct
cancer-related research in Montana.
I hope this additional information is useful to you and your staff in your consideration of
our veto request of SB 410. Thank you for considering our perspective.

RE: Veto Request for Senate Bill 410 – Montana Genomic Security Act
Dear Governor Gianforte,
On behalf of the Montana Bioscience Alliance and the many researchers, entrepreneurs, and
small businesses we represent across our state, I respectfully urge you to veto Senate Bill 410.
Montana has long been a quiet leader in bioscience innovation. From the foundational work of
Dr. Maurice Hilleman to the world-class infectious disease research at NIH’s Rocky Mountain
Laboratories in Hamilton, our state has contributed to global health breakthroughs while
supporting the growth of local companies working on diagnostics, therapeutics, and public
health solutions.
SB 410, as currently written, threatens to undermine that progress.
While we support the bill’s intent to protect sensitive data from foreign adversaries, its overly
broad data storage and access restrictions, particularly the mandate that genetic sequencing
data from Montana cannot be stored or accessed outside the United States, would have
immediate and harmful effects on Montana’s research and business community.
Across our state, small companies and startups depend on international collaboration to remain
competitive and to scale innovation. Many of our bioscience entrepreneurs are engaged in
research partnerships and clinical trials with trusted institutions and companies in Canada, the
United Kingdom, Spain, Australia, Denmark, Japan, Taiwan, and other allied nations. SB 410
would abruptly disrupt these joint efforts, cutting off access to shared genetic data platforms,
delaying research, and jeopardizing both public and private investments in Montana’s
bioscience sector.
Montana cannot afford to isolate itself from global scientific advancement. These partnerships
are not only vital to curing disease and improving health outcomes—they also bring federal
grants, foreign investment, and high-wage jobs to our communities. Emerging companies in
places like Bozeman, Missoula, Hamilton, and Great Falls rely on cloud-based tools and
data-sharing platforms that span international boundaries. Limiting them to only U.S.-based
systems places them at a disadvantage, particularly against competitors in other states that
have taken a more targeted approach.
Furthermore, SB 410 could inadvertently undermine Montana's recently expanded Right to Try
Act, which aims to provide patients with access to experimental therapies that have passed
Phase I clinical trials but are not yet approved by the FDA. Many of these investigational
treatments are developed through international collaborations and may involve data storage or
analysis outside the United States. By restricting such data interactions, SB 410 could limit the
very access to experimental treatments that the Right to Try Act seeks to provide, thereby
conflicting with the state's commitment to patient autonomy and access to cutting-edge medical
care.
Key Statistics Highlighting the Impact:
● Since 2004, over 1,287 clinical trials have been conducted or are ongoing in Montana.
● As of 2022, 116 clinical trials are currently open in the state.
● In 2017 alone, 133 active trials supported an estimated 3,242 Montanans participating
in clinical research.
● The biopharmaceutical industry supports more than 4,600 jobs across Montana.
● It contributes to $1.1 billion in annual economic activity, including direct industry
output and local supplier and vendor spending.
As drafted, SB 410 would send a chilling signal to our research institutions and innovators: that
Montana is not a safe or practical place to conduct bioscience work with global impact. This bill
would make Montana an outlier, isolated at a time when collaboration and data-sharing are key
drivers of medical and scientific progress.
We respectfully ask that you veto SB 410 for the future of our bioscience industry and for the
health and economy of all Montanans.
Sincerely,
Cassandra Sunell

Governor Gianforte:
The Montana Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests that you veto S.B. 410 due to the
potential unintended consequences this legislation may have on clinical research and the
entrepreneurship it supports.
We acknowledge and appreciate Senator Zolnikov’s genuine concerns regarding the use of
foreign genetic sequencers. However, other provisions within S.B. 410 would significantly limit the
ability of some of our members, including hospitals and manufacturers, to engage in research
collaborations with international partners, including those in Canada. The enactment of this
legislation could stifle medical-technology entrepreneurship and innovation in Montana.
SB 410’s rigid data restrictions could create significant barriers for small companies and startups
looking to establish or expand in Montana. These companies often rely on global research
collaborations and flexible data-sharing to bring innovative technologies to market.
By imposing strict limitations on data access and storage, the bill creates an environment that
could disincentivize emerging medical technology companies from investing or locating in
Montana, ultimately stifling job growth and economic development.
Our foremost concern involves Section 5, which prohibits storing data outside the US, and
stipulates that “genetic sequencing data from the state may not be accessed remotely from
outside the United States unless explicit written approval is obtained from the individuals whose
data would be accessed.”
Advancements in biomedical research rely heavily on collaboration among some of the leading
scientists and physicians globally, necessitating international partnerships with experts. Our
member providers and companies are committed to safeguarding the data of our research
participants and adhere to a comprehensive array of laws, regulations, and company standards to
ensure the protection of sensitive information. If this bill is enacted, they have concerns about their
capacity to continue conducting research in Montana.
SB 410 may not only harm patients by preventing Montanans from accessing lifesaving research
and treatment options, it will also stymie your efforts and our own to promote entrepreneurship
and startups in our state.
We have discussed our concerns with Senator Zolnikov and shared enacted language from other
states that should address his concerns while keeping Montana open for business.

RE: Senate Bill 410: Montana Genomic Security Act
Dear Governor Gianforte:
The Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) urges you to VETO Senate Bill (SB) 410,
which is currently on your desk. BIO shares the goal of protecting sensitive data from nefarious
access by foreign adversaries. However, as currently written, SB 410 would inadvertently block
vital, legitimate partnerships and scientific advances that depend on lawful, regulated
international data access. This will slow access to innovative and life-saving health solutions for
patients in Montana.
BIO is the world's largest trade association representing biotechnology companies, academic
institutions, state biotechnology centers and related organizations across the United States and
in more than 30 other nations. BIO’s members develop medical products and technologies to
treat patients afflicted with serious diseases, delay their onset, or prevent them in the first place.
In that way, our members’ novel therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics not only have improved
health outcomes, but also have reduced healthcare expenditures due to fewer physician office
visits, hospitalizations, and surgical interventions. BIO membership includes biologics and
vaccine manufacturers and developers who have worked closely with stakeholders across the
spectrum, including the public health and advocacy communities, to support policies that help
ensure access to innovative and life- saving medicines and vaccines for all individuals.
Genome sequencing and gene editing are critical tools in modern biotechnology. Researchers
are now exploring the use of genome editing to treat or prevent genetically defined diseases,
such as sickle cell disease, and many others. The human genome – our biological instructional
manual - contains about 20,000 genes. More than 6,000 human diseases are currently known
to have genetic basis. Restricting responsible access to genetic sequencing data will stifle
promising research aimed at tackling these diseases.
BIO has concerns regarding provisions in SB 410 that mandate domestic storage of all genetic
sequencing data and prohibit access to this data from outside of the United States.
This overly broad restriction would hinder essential biomedical research by our members by
impeding data sharing and collaboration with trusted research partners and institutions located
outside the United States. BIO’s members are global companies that rely on international
collaboration, including the use of secure data platforms developed by domestic and global
partners, to conduct cutting-edge research that benefits patients in Montana and the rest of the
United States.
We urge a more narrowly tailored approach that protects data from nefarious access by foreign
adversary governments while preserving the ability to engage with trusted international research
partners.
For these reasons, we respectfully oppose SB 410 in its current form and urge you to
VETO this measure. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at
pcastro@bio.org.

Re: SB 410 – Veto Request
Governor Gianforte:
On behalf of AdvaMed, the medtech association, I am writing to request your veto
of Senate Bill 410. We understand the goal behind this bill, however as currently
drafted there are major unintended consequences for clinical research.
AdvaMed is the largest medical technology association, representing the innovators
and manufacturers transforming health care through earlier disease detection, less
invasive procedures, and more effective treatments. Our over 600 members range
from emerging companies to large multinationals, and include traditional device,
diagnostic, medical imaging, and digital health technology companies.
We appreciate the author’s intent and concern around the use of foreign genetic
sequencers and agree this is an important issue. SB 410, as passed by the
legislature, would have a significant impact on a company's ability to conduct
research with partners outside of the United States. The impact of this legislation
being signed could stifle innovation and lead to unintended consequences for
Montana patients.
Specifically, our concern is the data storage and access requirements in Section 5
that requires “storage of all genetic sequencing data from the state must be
restricted to the geographic location of the United States. Other than open
data, genetic sequencing data from the state may not be remotely accessed
from outside the United States unless approved in writing by the individuals
whose data would be accessed.”
Genetic information and data used in medical research is often deidentified and
shared with clinical research partners in other countries. The sharing of this
information is incredibly important for clinical trials needed for FDA device
approvals and continuing the important work to advance medical technology
innovations.
advamed.org :: @AdvaMedUpdate :: AdvaMed 1 ::

Page 2 of 2
Our suggested amendment would have prohibited genetic sequencing data storage
in and access by foreign adversary countries. This would have allowed research to
continue with partners outside of the United States but would have prevented
genetic sequencing data from being shared with foreign adversaries, which we
believe was the goal of the bill. This language has been incorporated into similar
legislation in states like Utah, Texas, Kansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Arkansas.
Consistent with this approach, the U.S. Department of Justice recently issued a final
rule,1 carrying out Executive Order 14117, which addresses Americans’ personal
data and access by “countries of concern” that became effective on April 8, 2025.
Specifically, the Data Security Program prohibits the transfer of bulk sensitive data,
including genetic data, to China and other countries of concern.
In closing, this legislation makes Montana an outlier and may have unintended
consequences on data used for critical, lifesaving research. For these reasons, we
respectfully request that you veto Senate Bill 410.

restrictions on access, and other cybersecurity best practices,” Montanans can rest
assured that existing state and federal law already protect their genetic data to this
standard.
• Section 7(b) of the Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act already requires that
a company "(b) establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative,
technical, and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality,
integrity, and accessibility of personal data appropriate to the volume and nature
of the personal data at issue." Genetic data is universally considered to be
among the most sensitive types of data, subject to the highest security
requirements. The Attorney General is empowered to enforce this law.
• At the federal level, most genetic data collected by and through health care
providers is covered by the HIPAA Security Rule, which is widely regarded as
among the most strict and prescriptive security standards. In addition, the FTC
regularly brings enforcement actions under Section 5 of the FTC Act against
companies for failing to secure health data, including genetic data.

Moreover, at both the state and federal level, breach notification laws place significant
pressure on companies to secure genetic and other health data in order to avoid the
consequences of a data breach. Indeed, when a data breach occurs, companies must
notify individuals, State regulators, and Federal regulators, giving rise to enforcement
risks and class actions.
Lastly, it is important to note that US Department of Justice published a Final Rule (28
CFR Part 202 "Access to U.S. Sensitive Personal Data and Government-related
Data by Countries of Concern or Covered Persons," which was made effective on
April 18, 2025) which criminalizes the transfer of covered genetic data (100 records or
more) to countries of concern and individuals working in those countries or for
companies domiciled there. This means that – with certain narrow exceptions, including
importantly for FDA-regulated clinical trial activity – existing federal regulations already
prohibit the sharing of genetic data of Montanans with people in adversarial countries.”
If SB 410 is signed into law, these restrictions will extend to non-adversarial countries,
including Canada and the European Union, and to contexts where such restrictions are
likely NOT in the best interest of those whose data is being used (eg, clinical trials).
Attached to this letter is a spreadsheet created from clinicaltrials.gov which lists all
planned and currently enrolling clinical trials (n=258), as well as recently completed
studies (n=2,724), which include patients and sites in Montana. These are examples of
clinical research (and patient care) that will – very unfortunately - be at risk to
continue/move to completion upon the enactment of SB 410 (or are examples of studies
in Montana that would have been impacted by enactment).
Lastly, in our previous correspondence, we noted our commitment to work with the bill
sponsor on an amendment that would restrict genetic sequencing data storage and
access specifically in foreign adversary countries but would allow for ongoing research
collaborations with international partners. We mentioned several states’ legislative
activity in our May 12, 2025 correspondence that could be considered, but one specific
example for reference is Tennessee (HB25-395), which was enacted on April 4, 2025.
68-30-205. (a) A medical facility or research facility shall not store genetic
sequencing data within a foreign adversary. The medical facility or research
facility shall not allow remote access to genetic sequencing data storage within
its direction or control, other than open data, to a foreign adversary, unless
approved in writing by the commissioner of health.
Cutting edge biomedical research requires collaboration between some of the world's
most knowledgeable scientists and physicians and consequently requires international
collaboration among experts. At Johnson & Johnson, we take seriously the security of
our research participants’ data, and comply with a complex existing series of laws,
regulations, and professional and company standards and policies to ensure protection
2

of sensitive data. If enacted, we have concerns about our ability to continue to conduct
cancer-related research in Montana.
I hope this additional information is useful to you and your staff in your consideration of
our veto request of SB 410. Thank you for considering our perspective.

Governor of the State of Montana
State Capitol
P.O. Box 200801

RE: Veto Request for Senate Bill 410 – Montana Genomic Security Act
Dear Governor Gianforte,
On behalf of the Montana Bioscience Alliance and the many researchers, entrepreneurs, and
small businesses we represent across our state, I respectfully urge you to veto Senate Bill 410.
Montana has long been a quiet leader in bioscience innovation. From the foundational work of
Dr. Maurice Hilleman to the world-class infectious disease research at NIH’s Rocky Mountain
Laboratories in Hamilton, our state has contributed to global health breakthroughs while
supporting the growth of local companies working on diagnostics, therapeutics, and public
health solutions.
SB 410, as currently written, threatens to undermine that progress.
While we support the bill’s intent to protect sensitive data from foreign adversaries, its overly
broad data storage and access restrictions, particularly the mandate that genetic sequencing
data from Montana cannot be stored or accessed outside the United States, would have
immediate and harmful effects on Montana’s research and business community.
Across our state, small companies and startups depend on international collaboration to remain
competitive and to scale innovation. Many of our bioscience entrepreneurs are engaged in
research partnerships and clinical trials with trusted institutions and companies in Canada, the
United Kingdom, Spain, Australia, Denmark, Japan, Taiwan, and other allied nations. SB 410
would abruptly disrupt these joint efforts, cutting off access to shared genetic data platforms,
delaying research, and jeopardizing both public and private investments in Montana’s
bioscience sector.
Montana cannot afford to isolate itself from global scientific advancement. These partnerships
are not only vital to curing disease and improving health outcomes—they also bring federal
grants, foreign investment, and high-wage jobs to our communities. Emerging companies in
places like Bozeman, Missoula, Hamilton, and Great Falls rely on cloud-based tools and

data-sharing platforms that span international boundaries. Limiting them to only U.S.-based
systems places them at a disadvantage, particularly against competitors in other states that
have taken a more targeted approach.
Furthermore, SB 410 could inadvertently undermine Montana's recently expanded Right to Try
Act, which aims to provide patients with access to experimental therapies that have passed
Phase I clinical trials but are not yet approved by the FDA. Many of these investigational
treatments are developed through international collaborations and may involve data storage or
analysis outside the United States. By restricting such data interactions, SB 410 could limit the
very access to experimental treatments that the Right to Try Act seeks to provide, thereby
conflicting with the state's commitment to patient autonomy and access to cutting-edge medical
care.
Key Statistics Highlighting the Impact:
● Since 2004, over 1,287 clinical trials have been conducted or are ongoing in Montana.
● As of 2022, 116 clinical trials are currently open in the state.
● In 2017 alone, 133 active trials supported an estimated 3,242 Montanans participating
in clinical research.
● The biopharmaceutical industry supports more than 4,600 jobs across Montana.
● It contributes to $1.1 billion in annual economic activity, including direct industry
output and local supplier and vendor spending.
As drafted, SB 410 would send a chilling signal to our research institutions and innovators: that
Montana is not a safe or practical place to conduct bioscience work with global impact. This bill
would make Montana an outlier, isolated at a time when collaboration and data-sharing are key
drivers of medical and scientific progress.
We respectfully ask that you veto SB 410 for the future of our bioscience industry and for the
health and economy of all Montanans.
Sincerely,
Cassandra Sunell
Executive Director
Montana Bioscience Alliance
Executive Director

Governor Gianforte:
The Montana Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests that you veto S.B. 410 due to the
potential unintended consequences this legislation may have on clinical research and the
entrepreneurship it supports.
We acknowledge and appreciate Senator Zolnikov’s genuine concerns regarding the use of
foreign genetic sequencers. However, other provisions within S.B. 410 would significantly limit the
ability of some of our members, including hospitals and manufacturers, to engage in research
collaborations with international partners, including those in Canada. The enactment of this
legislation could stifle medical-technology entrepreneurship and innovation in Montana.
SB 410’s rigid data restrictions could create significant barriers for small companies and startups
looking to establish or expand in Montana. These companies often rely on global research
collaborations and flexible data-sharing to bring innovative technologies to market.
By imposing strict limitations on data access and storage, the bill creates an environment that
could disincentivize emerging medical technology companies from investing or locating in
Montana, ultimately stifling job growth and economic development.
Our foremost concern involves Section 5, which prohibits storing data outside the US, and
stipulates that “genetic sequencing data from the state may not be accessed remotely from
outside the United States unless explicit written approval is obtained from the individuals whose
data would be accessed.”
Advancements in biomedical research rely heavily on collaboration among some of the leading
scientists and physicians globally, necessitating international partnerships with experts. Our
member providers and companies are committed to safeguarding the data of our research
participants and adhere to a comprehensive array of laws, regulations, and company standards to
ensure the protection of sensitive information. If this bill is enacted, they have concerns about their
capacity to continue conducting research in Montana.
SB 410 may not only harm patients by preventing Montanans from accessing lifesaving research
and treatment options, it will also stymie your efforts and our own to promote entrepreneurship
and startups in our state.
We have discussed our concerns with Senator Zolnikov and shared enacted language from other
states that should address his concerns while keeping Montana open for business.

RE: Senate Bill 410: Montana Genomic Security Act
Dear Governor Gianforte:
The Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) urges you to VETO Senate Bill (SB) 410,
which is currently on your desk. BIO shares the goal of protecting sensitive data from nefarious
access by foreign adversaries. However, as currently written, SB 410 would inadvertently block
vital, legitimate partnerships and scientific advances that depend on lawful, regulated
international data access. This will slow access to innovative and life-saving health solutions for
patients in Montana.
BIO is the world's largest trade association representing biotechnology companies, academic
institutions, state biotechnology centers and related organizations across the United States and
in more than 30 other nations. BIO’s members develop medical products and technologies to
treat patients afflicted with serious diseases, delay their onset, or prevent them in the first place.
In that way, our members’ novel therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics not only have improved
health outcomes, but also have reduced healthcare expenditures due to fewer physician office
visits, hospitalizations, and surgical interventions. BIO membership includes biologics and
vaccine manufacturers and developers who have worked closely with stakeholders across the
spectrum, including the public health and advocacy communities, to support policies that help
ensure access to innovative and life- saving medicines and vaccines for all individuals.
Genome sequencing and gene editing are critical tools in modern biotechnology. Researchers
are now exploring the use of genome editing to treat or prevent genetically defined diseases,
such as sickle cell disease, and many others. The human genome – our biological instructional
manual - contains about 20,000 genes. More than 6,000 human diseases are currently known
to have genetic basis. Restricting responsible access to genetic sequencing data will stifle
promising research aimed at tackling these diseases.
BIO has concerns regarding provisions in SB 410 that mandate domestic storage of all genetic
sequencing data and prohibit access to this data from outside of the United States.
This overly broad restriction would hinder essential biomedical research by our members by
impeding data sharing and collaboration with trusted research partners and institutions located
outside the United States. BIO’s members are global companies that rely on international
collaboration, including the use of secure data platforms developed by domestic and global

partners, to conduct cutting-edge research that benefits patients in Montana and the rest of the
United States.
We urge a more narrowly tailored approach that protects data from nefarious access by foreign
adversary governments while preserving the ability to engage with trusted international research
partners.
For these reasons, we respectfully oppose SB 410 in its current form and urge you to
VETO this measure. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at
pcastro@bio.org.

Re: SB 410 – Veto Request
Governor Gianforte:
On behalf of AdvaMed, the medtech association, I am writing to request your veto
of Senate Bill 410. We understand the goal behind this bill, however as currently
drafted there are major unintended consequences for clinical research.
AdvaMed is the largest medical technology association, representing the innovators
and manufacturers transforming health care through earlier disease detection, less
invasive procedures, and more effective treatments. Our over 600 members range
from emerging companies to large multinationals, and include traditional device,
diagnostic, medical imaging, and digital health technology companies.
We appreciate the author’s intent and concern around the use of foreign genetic
sequencers and agree this is an important issue. SB 410, as passed by the
legislature, would have a significant impact on a company's ability to conduct
research with partners outside of the United States. The impact of this legislation
being signed could stifle innovation and lead to unintended consequences for
Montana patients.
Specifically, our concern is the data storage and access requirements in Section 5
that requires “storage of all genetic sequencing data from the state must be
restricted to the geographic location of the United States. Other than open
data, genetic sequencing data from the state may not be remotely accessed
from outside the United States unless approved in writing by the individuals
whose data would be accessed.”
Genetic information and data used in medical research is often deidentified and
shared with clinical research partners in other countries. The sharing of this
information is incredibly important for clinical trials needed for FDA device
approvals and continuing the important work to advance medical technology
innovations.

Our suggested amendment would have prohibited genetic sequencing data storage
in and access by foreign adversary countries. This would have allowed research to
continue with partners outside of the United States but would have prevented
genetic sequencing data from being shared with foreign adversaries, which we
believe was the goal of the bill. This language has been incorporated into similar
legislation in states like Utah, Texas, Kansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Arkansas.
Consistent with this approach, the U.S. Department of Justice recently issued a final
rule,1 carrying out Executive Order 14117, which addresses Americans’ personal
data and access by “countries of concern” that became effective on April 8, 2025.
Specifically, the Data Security Program prohibits the transfer of bulk sensitive data,
including genetic data, to China and other countries of concern.
In closing, this legislation makes Montana an outlier and may have unintended
consequences on data used for critical, lifesaving research. For these reasons, we
respectfully request that you veto Senate Bill 410.
Sincerely,
Darbi Gottlieb
