7 surcharge rate, applicable to all employers enrolled in compensation plan No. 2 or plan No. 3, must be
8 calculated annually by the department by not later than April 30. The resulting rate, expressed as a percentage,
9 is levied against the premium paid by each employer enrolled under compensation plan No. 2 or plan No. 3 in

17 shall pay to the department all money collected as a premium surcharge within 20 days of the end of the
18 calendar quarter in which the money was collected. If an insurer fails to timely pay to the department the
19 premium surcharge collected under this section, the department may impose on the insurer an administrative
20 fine of $500 plus interest on the delinquent amount at the annual interest rate of 12%. Administrative fines and
21 interest must be deposited in the workers' compensation administration fund and may be used to pay the
22 reimbursement of premiums required under 39-71-319.
23 (e) If an employer fails to remit to an insurer the total amount due for the premium and premium
24 surcharge, the amount received by the insurer must be applied to the premium surcharge first and the
25 remaining amount applied to the premium due.
26 (f) The amount actually collected as a premium surcharge in a given year must be compared to
27 the assessment on the paid losses paid in the preceding year. Any excess amount collected must be deducted
28 from the amount to be collected as a premium surcharge in the following year. The amount collected that is less

27 the assessment on the paid losses paid in the preceding year. Any excess amount collected must be deducted
