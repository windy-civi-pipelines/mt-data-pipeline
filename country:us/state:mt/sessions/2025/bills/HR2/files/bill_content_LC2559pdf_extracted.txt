7
8 WHEREAS, critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are necessary for many vital applications,
9 including but not limited to high-performance and quantum computing, renewable and traditional energy
10 development, electric vehicles and batteries, medical imaging and technology, electronics, and high-strength
11 magnets, and for use by our nation's military, from special forces gear and munitions to tanks and fighter jets;
12 and
13 WHEREAS, the United States Geological Survey and the United States Department of Energy have
14 designated lists of these critical minerals and materials used for these purposes that are at risk of supply chain
15 disruption; and
16 WHEREAS, the United States currently imports a majority of its critical minerals for these purposes,
17 including from its geopolitical adversaries, mainly China, which controls more than 50% of the mining and over
18 90% of the processing, refining, and recycling and reuse for certain critical elements; and
19 WHEREAS, China has restricted and/or banned the export of certain critical minerals and rare earth
20 elements to the United States and its allies, including the technology used to produce them; and
21 WHEREAS, the White House and Congress have developed a myriad of programs, orders, and
22 initiatives to address these supply chain risks and are investing billions of dollars in domestic and allied critical
23 minerals mining, processing, refining, recycling and reuse, and manufacturing projects; and
24 WHEREAS, Montana has significant deposits of these listed critical minerals in its geology, both at
25 existing mines and at abandoned legacy sites; and
26 WHEREAS, Montana is home to the nation's only platinum group metals-producing mines, the
27 Stillwater and East Boulder mines, and has mines and processing facilities that produce or have historically
28 produced critical minerals, including copper, molybdenum, nickel, manganese, zinc, tungsten, antimony,

1 chromium, and aluminum, and is therefore uniquely poised to help America secure its critical minerals supply
2 chains; and
3 WHEREAS, Montana desires to responsibly develop its mineral resources and to expand and establish
4 mining, processing, refining, recycling and reuse, and manufacturing facilities for critical minerals, which would
5 advance its economy and be for the mutual benefit of our nation's technological, energy, and economic
6 advancements, and allow for our nation's continued security and defense; and
7 WHEREAS, critical minerals mining, processing, refining, recycling and reuse, and manufacturing done
8 in Montana and domestically, in accordance with our global-leading labor, safety, public engagement, and
9 environmental standards, provides responsible development assurances that result in major global
10 environmental and humanitarian benefits when compared to projects if they are conducted in China, Russia,
11 and many other developing countries; and
12 WHEREAS, the United States government, including its Department of Defense, and Montana's
13 Congressional Delegation have continued to support the advancement of critical minerals projects in Montana.

16 MONTANA:
17 That the 69th Legislature urges the state, federal, tribal, and local jurisdictions across Montana to
18 acknowledge the information provided here and to support the further study, identification, exploration, and
19 responsible and appropriate development, processing, refining, and recycling and reuse of critical minerals and
20 materials in Montana for the benefit of its local communities and economies and to strengthen America's
21 domestic supply chains for achieving its technological, economic, and energy transition goals and to secure its
22 national defense.
23 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State send copies of this resolution to the
24 President of the United States and his cabinet, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the
25 Majority Leader of the United States Senate, and the Montana Congressional Delegation.
