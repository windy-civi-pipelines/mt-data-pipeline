9
10 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Prohibiting weather modification BY GEOENGINEERING. (1) THE
11 LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT GEOENGINEERING POSES RISKS TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH DUE TO ITS
12 EXPERIMENTAL NATURE AND POTENTIAL FOR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.
13 (2) Except as FOR WEATHER MODIFICATION BY CLOUD SEEDING AS prescribed in 85-3-101 through 85-
14 3- 424 TITLE 85, CHAPTER 3, a person may not intentionally inject, release, or disperse chemicals, chemical
15 compounds, substances, or apparatuses within the borders of Montana expressly for: GEOENGINEERING.
16 (a) engaging in weather modification and control;
17 (b) affecting temperature; or
18 (c) affecting the intensity of the sunlight.
19 (2)(3) As used in this section:
20 (a) "chemical compounds" means any combination of any number of chemicals;
21 (b) "chemicals" means industrial substances, whether simple, compound, or obtained through the
22 process of the science and art of chemistry, whether of organic or inorganic origin; and
23 (c) "weather modification and control" means changing or controlling or attempting to change or
24 control, by artificial methods, the natural development of atmospheric cloud forms or precipitation forms that
25 occur in the troposphere.
26 (A) "CLOUD SEEDING" MEANS A PROVEN METHOD OF INCREASING PRECIPITATION WITHIN EXISTING CLOUD
27 SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT EFFORTS, INCLUDING FOR AGRICULTURE AND SNOW MAKING.
28 (B) "GEOENGINEERING" MEANS LARGE-SCALE, INTENTIONAL INTERVENTIONS IN THE EARTH'S CLIMATE
