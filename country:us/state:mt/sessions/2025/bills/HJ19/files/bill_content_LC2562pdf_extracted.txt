8 WHEREAS, it is the custom of the Montana Legislature to recognize official weeks that are set aside to
9 increase awareness of conditions that affect the lives of citizens of Montana; and
10 WHEREAS, attendant to such concern, it is the sense of the Montana Legislature to proclaim the last
11 full week of September as Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD) Awareness Week in the State of Montana, in
12 conjunction with the observance of World FTD Awareness Week; and
13 WHEREAS, FTD is identified in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease as a related
14 dementia and included as a priority in the goals and strategies of the plan to achieve the vision of a nation free
15 of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias; and
16 WHEREAS, a primary goal of the Montana Alzheimer’s and Dementia State Plan is to promote public
17 awareness and understanding of dementia related diseases; and
18 WHEREAS, the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) reports that frontotemporal
19 degeneration (FTD) is a terminal and incurable neurodegenerative disease affecting the frontal and temporal
20 lobes, causing impairments to speech, personality, behavior, and motor skills, which constitutes a major public
21 health concern; and
22 WHEREAS, it takes an average of 3.6 years from the onset of symptoms to get an accurate diagnosis
23 of FTD with average life expectancy of 7-13 years after start of symptoms; and
24 WHEREAS, FTD strikes people as young as 21 and old as 80 with the largest percentage of those
25 affected being in their 40s to 60s, rendering people in the prime of life unable to work or function normally; and
26 WHEREAS, FTD represents an estimated 5 to 15 percent of all dementia cases and is the most
27 common form of dementia for people under 60 years of age; and
28 WHEREAS, FTD is often misdiagnosed as a psychiatric problem or other neurodegenerative disease

69th Legislature 2025 LC 2562
1 because of the wide range of cognitive and behavioral symptoms and their young onset; and
2 WHEREAS, FTD imposes average annual costs associated with care and living with the disease that
3 are approximately double those of Alzheimer’s disease; and
4 WHEREAS, FTD often affects a person’s ability to express emotions and to show affection and
5 empathy for loved ones; and
6 WHEREAS, in the behavioral variant of FTD, a person’s sense of social graces and appropriate
7 behavior can be lost, and their personality may be significantly changed; and
8 WHEREAS, in the language variants of FTD (primary progressive aphasia), a person may have trouble
9 producing speech and understanding grammar, lose the meaning of words or become hesitant in their speech,
10 and may eventually become mute; and
11 WHEREAS, in the movement variants of FTD, a person may experience muscle weakness, falling, loss
12 of balance, difficulty making speech, difficulty swallowing, or choking; and
13 WHEREAS, while there has never been a global epidemiology study of FTD, it is estimated that more
14 than 60,000 people are affected in the United States today; and
15 WHEREAS, AFTD is the leading national organization exclusively focused on the spectrum of FTD
16 disorders with a mission to improve the quality of life of people affected by FTD and drive research to a cure;
17 and
18 WHEREAS, it is imperative that there be greater awareness of this serious disease, and more must be
19 done to increase activity at the local, state, and national levels.
