4 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT GENERALLY REVISING LAWS RELATING TO DRUGS;
5 PROHIBITING DISADVANTAGING OR DISCOURAGING MEDICAID AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE
6 COVERAGE FOR NONOPIOID DRUGS AS PRESCRIBED; APPLYING TO MEDICAID; APPLYING TO
7 COMMERCIAL INSURANCE; INCLUDING CERTAIN PLANS UNDER THE ACT; AND AMENDING SECTIONS

10 WHEREAS, Montana has acted proactively to combat opioid addiction and overdose deaths from
11 opioids; however, work remains to be done to decrease and prevent opioid addiction. Patients, especially those
12 with risk factors for opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose, should have equal access to nonopioid drugs and
13 prescribers should not be prevented from prescribing either a nonopioid or opioid drug; and
14 WHEREAS, formulary placement and utilization management barriers are used to limit prescribers and
15 patients from accessing pain management treatment alternatives; and
16 THEREFORE, it is the intent of the Legislature to ensure prescribers and patients have the necessary
17 tools available to comprehensively approach pain management by equalizing access between nonopioid and
18 opioid prescriptions and preventing systems that disadvantage pain management prescription drugs.

20 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
21
22 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Pain relief parity in medicaid. (1) In establishing and maintaining the
23 formulary and preferred drug list, the Montana department of public health and human services shall ensure
24 that nonopioid drugs approved by the federal food and drug administration for the treatment or management of
25 pain may not be disadvantaged or discouraged, with respect to medicaid coverage, for an opioid or narcotic
26 drug for the treatment or management of pain on the formulary and preferred drug list.
27 (2) This section applies to a nonopioid drug immediately on approval by the federal food and drug
28 administration for the treatment or management of pain, regardless of whether the drug has been reviewed by

2 provided under a contract between the department and any managed care organization.
3 (3) For the purposes of this section, the terms "disadvantaged" and "discouraged" include but are
4 not limited to:
5 (a) designating a nonopioid drug as a nonpreferred drug if an opioid or narcotic drug is designated
6 as a preferred drug; or
7 (b) establishing more restrictive or more extensive utilization controls, including but not limited to
8 more restrictive or more extensive prior authorization or step therapy requirements, for a nonopioid drug than
9 the least restrictive or extensive utilization controls applicable to an opioid or narcotic drug. Nothing in this
10 section precludes one opioid drug from being preferred over another opioid drug or one nonopioid drug from
11 being preferred over another nonopioid drug.
12
13 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Pain relief parity in commercial insurance. (1) In establishing and
14 maintaining its formulary and preferred drug list, any commercial insurance policy, certificate, or contract that is
15 delivered, issued for delivery, or renewed in this state, or any self-funded employee benefit plan, to the extent
16 not preempted by federal law, must ensure that nonopioid drugs approved by the federal food and drug
17 administration for the treatment or management of pain may not be disadvantaged or discouraged, with respect
18 to coverage or cost sharing, for an opioid or narcotic drug for the treatment or management of pain on the
19 formulary and preferred drug list.
20 (2) This section applies to a nonopioid drug immediately on approval by the federal food and drug
21 administration for the treatment or management of pain.
22 (3) If any commercial insurance policy, certificate, or contract that is delivered, issued for delivery,
23 or renewed in this state, or any self-funded employee benefit plan, to the extent not preempted by federal law,
24 restricts coverage of a nonopioid prescription drug for the treatment or management of pain, including through
25 utilization management policies, such as prior authorization or step therapy, the prescribing health care provider
26 must be granted an exception to the restriction if the prescribing health care provider confirms that, based on
27 the provider's professional judgment, the nonopioid prescription drug is appropriate for the treatment of the
28 patient.

4 coverage criteria imposed on an opioid or narcotic drug;

6 more restrictive or more extensive prior authorization or step therapy requirements, for a nonopioid drug than
7 the least restrictive or extensive utilization controls applicable to an opioid or narcotic drug; or

9 or renewed in this state, or any self-funded employee benefit plan, to the extent not preempted by federal law,
10 maintains a formulary grouped into tiers for the purposes of determining cost-sharing, placing a nonopioid drug
11 on a tier that requires a cost-sharing responsibility that exceeds the lowest cost-sharing responsibility required
