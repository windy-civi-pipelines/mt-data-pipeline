13 resolution proceeding. An alternative dispute resolution proceeding under this chapter may include a family
14 engagement meeting, mediation, or a settlement conference. If a court orders an alternative dispute resolution

12 alternative dispute resolution proceeding or the parties may voluntarily participate in an alternative dispute
13 resolution proceeding. An alternative dispute resolution proceeding under this chapter may include a family
14 engagement meeting, mediation, or a settlement conference. If a court orders an alternative dispute resolution

18 (13) Service of a petition under this section must be accompanied by a written notice advising the
19 child's parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child of the:
