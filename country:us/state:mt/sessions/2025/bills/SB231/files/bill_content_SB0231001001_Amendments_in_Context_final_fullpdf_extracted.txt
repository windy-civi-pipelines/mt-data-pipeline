22 child must be given notice of all reviews by the reviewing body.
23 (b) A foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative of the child who is caring for or a relative of the

16 alternative dispute resolution proceeding or the parties may voluntarily participate in an alternative dispute
17 resolution proceeding. An alternative dispute resolution proceeding under this chapter may include a family
18 engagement meeting, mediation, or a settlement conference. If a court orders an alternative dispute resolution
19 proceeding, a party who does not wish to participate may file a motion objecting to the order. If the department
20 is a party to the original proceeding, a representative of the department who has complete authority to settle the
21 issue or issues in the original proceeding must be present at any alternative dispute resolution proceeding.
22 (13) Service of a petition under this section must be accompanied by a written notice advising the
23 child's parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child of the:

11 (15) A court may appoint a standing master to conduct hearings and propose decisions and orders

25 whereabouts of the parents, guardian, or nearest adult relative, and any other matters the court considers

26 presented on those subjects provided for in 41-3-437(4), determines that the intervention of the person is in the

14 425.
15 (12) At any stage of the proceedings considered appropriate by the court, the court may order an
16 alternative dispute resolution proceeding or the parties may voluntarily participate in an alternative dispute
17 resolution proceeding. An alternative dispute resolution proceeding under this chapter may include a family
18 engagement meeting, mediation, or a settlement conference. If a court orders an alternative dispute resolution
19 proceeding, a party who does not wish to participate may file a motion objecting to the order. If the department
20 is a party to the original proceeding, a representative of the department who has complete authority to settle the
21 issue or issues in the original proceeding must be present at any alternative dispute resolution proceeding.
22 (13) Service of a petition under this section must be accompanied by a written notice advising the
23 child's parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child of the:

9 terminate parental rights; and
10 (c) completion of a treatment plan does not guarantee the return of a child.
11 (15) A court may appoint a standing master to conduct hearings and propose decisions and orders

4 foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative caring for the child must be given legal notice by the attorney filing
5 the petition of all judicial hearings for the child and has the right to be heard. The right to appear or to be heard

11 presented on those subjects provided for in 41-3-437(4), determines that the intervention of the person is in the
12 best interests of the child. A person granted intervention pursuant to this subsection (12)(b) (10)(b) is entitled to
13 participate in the adjudicatory hearing held pursuant to 41-3-437 and to notice and participation in subsequent
14 proceedings held pursuant to this chapter involving the custody of the child.

2 dispute resolution proceeding. An alternative dispute resolution proceeding under this chapter may include a
3 family engagement meeting, mediation, or a settlement conference. If a court orders an alternative dispute
4 resolution proceeding, a party who does not wish to participate may file a motion objecting to the order. If the
5 department is a party to the original proceeding, a representative of the department who has complete authority
6 to settle the issue or issues in the original proceeding must be present at any alternative dispute resolution
7 proceeding.
8 (13)(16)(14) Service of a petition under this section must be accompanied by a written notice
9 advising the child's parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child of the:
10 (a) right, pursuant to 41-3-425, to appointment or assignment of counsel if the person is indigent or
11 if appointment or assignment of counsel is required under the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, if applicable;
12 (b) right to contest the allegations in the petition; and
13 (c) timelines for hearings and determinations required under this chapter.
14 (14)(17)(15) If appropriate, orders issued under this chapter must contain a notice provision
15 advising a child's parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child that:
16 (a) the court is required by federal and state laws to hold a permanency hearing to determine the
17 permanent placement of a child no later than 12 months after a judge determines that the child has been
18 abused or neglected or 12 months after the first 60 days that the child has been removed from the child's home;
19 (b) if a child has been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months, state law presumes that
20 termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child and the state is required to file a petition to
21 terminate parental rights; and
22 (c) completion of a treatment plan does not guarantee the return of a child.
23 (15)(18)(16) A court may appoint a standing master to conduct hearings and propose decisions and
24 orders to the court for court consideration and action. A standing master may not conduct a proceeding to
25 terminate parental rights. A standing master must be a member of the state bar of Montana and must be
26 knowledgeable in the area of child abuse and neglect laws."

19 (i) which allegations of the petition have been proved or admitted, if any;
