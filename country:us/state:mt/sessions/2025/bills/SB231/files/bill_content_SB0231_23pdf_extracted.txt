13 alternative dispute resolution proceeding or the parties may voluntarily participate in an alternative dispute
14 resolution proceeding. An alternative dispute resolution proceeding under this chapter may include a family

18 issue or issues in the original proceeding must be present at any alternative dispute resolution proceeding.
19 (13) Service of a petition under this section must be accompanied by a written notice advising the
20 child's parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child of the:

25 (b) whether the child was placed or allowed to remain by the parents with another person for the
26 care of the child, and, if so, then the court shall accept evidence regarding:

1 residence, schooling, and activities outside of the home; and
2 (iii) the circumstances under which the child was placed or allowed to remain with that other
3 person, including:
4 (A) whether a parent requesting return of the child was previously prevented from doing so as a
5 result of an order issued pursuant to Title 40, chapter 15, part 2, or of a conviction pursuant to 45-5-206; and
6 (B) whether the child was originally placed with the other person to allow the parent to seek
7 employment or attend school.
8 (5) In all civil and criminal proceedings relating to abuse or neglect, the privileges related to the
9 examination or treatment of the child do not apply, except the attorney-client privilege granted by 26-1-803 and
10 the mediation privilege granted by 26-1-813.
11 (6) (a) If the court determines that the child is not an abused or neglected child, the petition must
12 be dismissed and any order made pursuant to 41-3-427 or 41-3-432 must be vacated.
13 (b) If the child is adjudicated a youth in need of care, the court shall set a date for a dispositional
14 hearing to be conducted within 20 days, as provided in 41-3-438(1), and order any necessary or required
15 investigations. The court may issue a temporary dispositional order pending the dispositional hearing. The
16 temporary dispositional order may provide for any of the forms of relief listed in 41-3-427(2).
17 (7) (a) Before making an adjudication, the court may make oral findings, and following the
18 adjudicatory hearing, the court shall make written findings on issues, including but not limited to the following:
19 (i) which allegations of the petition have been proved or admitted, if any;
20 (ii) whether there is a legal basis for continued court and department intervention; and
21 (iii) whether the department has made reasonable efforts to avoid protective placement of the child
22 or to make it possible to safely return the child to the child's home.
23 (b) The court may order:
24 (i) terms for visitation, support, and other intrafamily communication pending disposition if the
25 child is to be placed or to remain in temporary out-of-home care prior to disposition;
26 (ii) examinations, evaluations, or counseling of the child or parents in preparation for the
27 disposition hearing that does not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds
28 after notice and a hearing that the expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The

1 department is the payor of last resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
2 (iii) the department to evaluate the noncustodial parent or relatives as possible caretakers, if not
3 already done;
4 (iv) the perpetrator of the alleged child abuse or neglect to be removed from the home to allow the
5 child to remain in the home; and
6 (v) the department to continue efforts to notify noncustodial parents.
7 (8) If a proceeding under this chapter involves an Indian child and is subject to the federal Indian

12 Montana Rules of Civil Procedure and the Montana Rules of Evidence apply except as modified in this chapter.
13 Proceedings under a petition are not a bar to criminal prosecution.

19 does not make that person a party to the action. Any foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative caring for the
20 child must be given notice of all reviews by the reviewing body.
21 (b) A foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative of the child who is caring for or a relative of the

24 presented on those subjects provided for in 41-3-437(4), determines that the intervention of the person is in the
25 best interests of the child. A person granted intervention pursuant to this subsection is entitled to participate in
26 the adjudicatory hearing held pursuant to 41-3-437 and to notice and participation in subsequent proceedings

12 (12) At any stage of the proceedings considered appropriate by the court, the court may order an
13 alternative dispute resolution proceeding or the parties may voluntarily participate in an alternative dispute
14 resolution proceeding. An alternative dispute resolution proceeding under this chapter may include a family
15 engagement meeting, mediation, or a settlement conference. If a court orders an alternative dispute resolution
16 proceeding, a party who does not wish to participate may file a motion objecting to the order. If the department
17 is a party to the original proceeding, a representative of the department who has complete authority to settle the
18 issue or issues in the original proceeding must be present at any alternative dispute resolution proceeding.
19 (13) Service of a petition under this section must be accompanied by a written notice advising the
20 child's parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child of the:

7 (15) A court may appoint a standing master to conduct hearings and propose decisions and orders
