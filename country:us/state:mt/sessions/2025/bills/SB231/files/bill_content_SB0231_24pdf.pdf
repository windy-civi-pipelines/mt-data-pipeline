13 alternative dispute resolution proceeding or the parties may voluntarily participate in an alternative dispute
14 resolution proceeding. An alternative dispute resolution proceeding under this chapter may include a family
15 engagement meeting, mediation, or a settlement conference. If a court orders an alternative dispute resolution
16 proceeding, a party who does not wish to participate may file a motion objecting to the order. If the department

18 issue or issues in the original proceeding must be present at any alternative dispute resolution proceeding.
19 (13) Service of a petition under this section must be accompanied by a written notice advising the
20 child's parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child of the:

3 result of an order issued pursuant to Title 40, chapter 15, part 2, or of a conviction pursuant to 45-5-206; and
4 (B) whether the child was originally placed with the other person to allow the parent to seek

7 examination or treatment of the child do not apply, except the attorney-client privilege granted by 26-1-803 and
8 the mediation privilege granted by 26-1-813.

10 be dismissed and any order made pursuant to 41-3-427 or 41-3-432 must be vacated.
11 (b) If the child is adjudicated a youth in need of care, the court shall set a date for a dispositional
12 hearing to be conducted within 20 days, as provided in 41-3-438(1), and order any necessary or required
13 investigations. The court may issue a temporary dispositional order pending the dispositional hearing. The
14 temporary dispositional order may provide for any of the forms of relief listed in 41-3-427(2).
15 (7) (a) Before making an adjudication, the court may make oral findings, and following the

17 (i) which allegations of the petition have been proved or admitted, if any;
18 (ii) whether there is a legal basis for continued court and department intervention; and
19 (iii) whether the department has made reasonable efforts to avoid protective placement of the child
20 or to make it possible to safely return the child to the child's home.
21 (b) The court may order:
22 (i) terms for visitation, support, and other intrafamily communication pending disposition if the
23 child is to be placed or to remain in temporary out-of-home care prior to disposition;
24 (ii) examinations, evaluations, or counseling of the child or parents in preparation for the
25 disposition hearing that does not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds
26 after notice and a hearing that the expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The
27 department is the payor of last resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
28 (iii) the department to evaluate the noncustodial parent or relatives as possible caretakers, if not

6 Child Welfare Act, a qualified expert witness is required to testify that the continued custody of the child by the
7 parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child."
