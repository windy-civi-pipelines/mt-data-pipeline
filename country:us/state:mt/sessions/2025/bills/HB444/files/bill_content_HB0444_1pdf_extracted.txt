19 of the tenancy.
20 (3) Cleaning charges may not be imposed for normal maintenance performed on a cyclical basis
21 by the landlord as noted by the landlord at the time that the tenant occupies the space unless the landlord is

1 the tenant, or mailed with a certificate of mailing or by certified mail to the tenant at the place indicated by the
2 tenant as the place for receipt of the communication or, in the absence of a designation, to the tenant's last-
3 known address. If notice is transmitted by electronic mail, it is complete on receipt of a read receipt generated
4 by an electronic mail system or an electronic mail reply other than an automatically generated electronic mail
5 reply. If notice is mailed by certified mail, service of the notice is considered to have been made 3 days after the
6 date of the mailing. A tenant who fails to notify the landlord of the intent to vacate or who vacates the premises
7 without notice relieves the landlord of the requirement of giving notice and allows the landlord to deduct the
8 cleaning charges from the deposit, or the landlord may leave a copy of the notice in a conspicuous location in
9 the rental unit and notify the tenant by e-mail, phone, or text, and notice is considered delivered.
10 (4) A person may not deduct or withhold from the security deposit any amount for purposes other
11 than those set forth in this section."

19 provisions of 70-25-201 have been followed, with regard to the leasehold premises that the landlord alleges are
20 the responsibility of the tenant. Delivery of the list must be accompanied by payment of the difference, if any,
21 between the security deposit and the permitted charges set forth in 70-25-201. Delivery must be accomplished
22 by transmitting the list to an electronic mail address provided by the tenant in the rental agreement and the

1 address provided by the tenant or, if a new address is not provided, to the tenant's last-known address.
2 (c) It is not a wrongful withholding of security deposit funds if the landlord mails the funds to the
3 last-known address of a tenant who has departed and the tenant does not receive the funds because the tenant

11 to provide the landlord with a new address in writing upon termination of the tenancy or upon surrender and
12 acceptance of the leasehold premises, whichever occurs first, does not bar the tenant from recovering the
13 amount owing to the tenant by the landlord.
14 (2) A landlord must be entitled to return a security deposit owing to a tenant by an electronic funds
15 transfer to an account designated by the tenant or on behalf of the tenant for recovering the amount owing to
