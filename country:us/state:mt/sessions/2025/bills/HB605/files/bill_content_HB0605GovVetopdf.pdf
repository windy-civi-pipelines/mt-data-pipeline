RE: HB 605 Veto Request
Dear Governor Gianforte:
On behalf of the board of directors of the Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (MSPOA), I am writing
to recommend and request that HB 605 be vetoed.
HB 605 was brought at the request of a particular county sheriff. In its original form, HB 605 was a good piece of
legislation that was broadly supported by sheriffs and detention center commanders. The bill would have enhanced
security and safety in detention centers by reducing the incidences and amount of dangerous drugs and other
contraband that infiltrates into county operated detention centers across the state. In fact, MSPOA appeared at the
hearing of the bill in both the House Judiciary Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee and recommended
passage of the bill.
However, the bill was amended in the Senate Judiciary Committee and the version that passed both chambers of the
Legislature does more harm than good, and it should be vetoed.
Subsection (3) of the bill requires each and every county to pay $250 to the Montana DOJ to “assist in the
development of guidelines for conducting strip searches.” Requiring each and every county to pay, regardless of a
county’s budget and regardless of whether a county operates a detention center, is arbitrary.1
Further, if guidelines for strip searches within county detention centers were needed, such guidelines could be
developed by the Montana DOJ within existing resources. There is also question as to whether this is an appropriate
role to assign the DOJ. As county operated facilities, each county attorney is already tasked with providing legal
guidance to the county sheriff on how to operate detention centers, including the intake and searching of detained
persons. While collaboration with the Montana DOJ is always welcome, it does not make sense for each county to
pay any amount to create guidance where counties already have attorneys to advise on the issue.
The MSPOA has reviewed the version of HB 605 that passed, and the board unanimously recommends that the bill
be vetoed.
Thank you for your time and attention.
Sincerely,
Nanette Gilbertson, Executive Director
Montana Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association
1 37 of Montana’s 56 counties operate detention centers. HB 605 requires those 19 that do not operate a detention center to
fund the development of guidelines.
