9 (c) The department of environmental quality shall promulgate rules specifying procedures,
10 including timeframes for certification application, and definitions necessary to identify air and water pollution
11 control and carbon capture equipment for certification and compliance. The department of revenue shall
12 promulgate rules pertaining to the valuation of qualifying air and water pollution control and carbon capture
