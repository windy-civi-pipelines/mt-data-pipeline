12 Section 2. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
14 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
15 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
16 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
17 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
18 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
19 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
20 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
21 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
22 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
23 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
24 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
25 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
26 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
27 labor.
28 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483

69th Legislature 2025 HB 483.1
1 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,

4 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
5 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
6 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
7 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
8 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
9 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
10 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
11 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
12 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
13 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
14 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
15 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
16 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
17 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
18 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
19 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
20 following tax year.
21 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
22 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
23 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
24 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
25 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
26 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
27 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) This section does not apply to:

3 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
4 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
5 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
6 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
7 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
8 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
9 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
10 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
11 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
12 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
13 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
14 (9)(8) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
15 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

12 (a) the sum of the maximum reimbursable expenditures for all approved school bus routes
13 maintained by the district (to determine the maximum reimbursable expenditure, multiply the applicable rate for
14 each bus mile by the total number of miles to be traveled during the ensuing school fiscal year on each bus
15 route approved by the county transportation committee and maintained by the district); plus
16 (b) the total of all individual transportation per diem reimbursement rates for the district as
17 determined from the contracts submitted by the district multiplied by the number of pupil-instruction days
18 scheduled for the ensuing school attendance year; plus
19 (c) any estimated costs for supervised home study or supervised correspondence study for the
20 ensuing school fiscal year; plus
21 (d) the amount budgeted in the budget for the contingency amount permitted in 20-10-143, except

7 any remaining amount of district revenue and fund balance reappropriated must be used to reduce the county
8 financing obligation in subsection (2)(a)(ii) and, if the county financing obligations are reduced to zero, to
9 reduce the state financial obligation in subsection (2)(a)(i).
10 (c) The county revenue requirement for a joint district, after the application of any district money
11 under subsection (2)(b), must be prorated to each county incorporated by the joint district in the same
12 proportion as the ANB of the joint district is distributed by pupil residence in each county.

3 fiscal year by the trustees from the end-of-the-year fund balance in the transportation fund. The operating
4 reserve may not be more than 20% of the final transportation fund budget for the ensuing school fiscal year and
5 is for the purpose of paying transportation fund warrants issued by the district under the final transportation fund
6 budget.
7 (4) The district levy requirement for each district's transportation fund must be computed by:

9 transportation budget amount; and
10 (b) subtracting the amount of money available to reduce the property tax on the district, as
11 determined in subsection (3), from the amount determined in subsection (4)(a).

12 Section 2. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
13 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
14 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
15 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
16 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
17 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
18 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
19 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
20 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
21 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
22 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
23 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
24 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
25 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
26 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
27 labor.
28 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any

69th Legislature 2025 HB 483.1

4 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
5 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
6 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
7 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
8 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
9 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
10 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
11 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
12 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
13 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
14 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
15 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
16 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
17 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
18 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
19 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
20 following tax year.
21 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
22 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
23 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
24 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
25 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
26 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
27 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) This section does not apply to:
28 (a) mills imposed under 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, or 20-25-439;

3 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
4 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
5 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
6 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
7 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
8 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
9 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
10 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
11 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
12 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
13 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
14 (9)(8) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
15 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

25 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
26 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.

11 nonbus miles within its own district or approved service area but may not claim reimbursement for the mileage.
12 Any vehicle, the operation of which is reimbursed for bus mileage under the rate provisions of this schedule,
13 must be a school bus, as defined by this title, driven by a qualified driver on a bus route approved by the county
14 transportation committee and the superintendent of public instruction.

24 (b) Nonbus mileage, as provided in subsection (1), must be reimbursed at a rate of 50 cents $1.00
25 a mile.
26 (3) The rated capacity is the number of passenger seating positions of a school bus as determined
27 under the policy adopted by the board of public education. If modification of a school bus to accommodate

12 (a) the sum of the maximum reimbursable expenditures for all approved school bus routes
13 maintained by the district (to determine the maximum reimbursable expenditure, multiply the applicable rate for
14 each bus mile by the total number of miles to be traveled during the ensuing school fiscal year on each bus
15 route approved by the county transportation committee and maintained by the district); plus
16 (b) the total of all individual transportation per diem reimbursement rates for the district as
17 determined from the contracts submitted by the district multiplied by the number of pupil-instruction days
18 scheduled for the ensuing school attendance year; plus
19 (c) any estimated costs for supervised home study or supervised correspondence study for the
20 ensuing school fiscal year; plus

4 reserve may not be more than 20% of the final transportation fund budget for the ensuing school fiscal year and
5 is for the purpose of paying transportation fund warrants issued by the district under the final transportation fund
