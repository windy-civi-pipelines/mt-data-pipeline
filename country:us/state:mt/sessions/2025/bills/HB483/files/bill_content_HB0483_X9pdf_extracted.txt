Section 1. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
"15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 483
number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
(b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
(c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
labor.
(2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
including newly taxable property.
(3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
(i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
(ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
(iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
(iv) subdivision of real property; and
(v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
(b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
(4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
(i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
(ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
(iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
(b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 483
required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
following tax year.
(c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
(d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
(5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) This section does not apply to:
(a) mills imposed under 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, or 20-25-439;
(a)(b) school district levies established in Title 20 or any other title of the Montana Code Annotated; or
(b)(c) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
(6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
(7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
(a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
(b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
(8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
(9)(8) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
(i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
(viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
(ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) (8)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the
authority.
(b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) (8)(a) may not be included in the amount of property
taxes actually assessed in a subsequent year.
(10)(9) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated
operating funds by a county or municipality during that time.

tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number determined by the
superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed to eligible school
districts equal to 85% of the decrease in the calculated amount between the 2 years; and
(ii) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school mill value
per ANB for school retirement guaranteed tax base purposes under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number
determined by the superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of retirement guaranteed tax base aid
distributed to eligible school districts counties equal to 15% of the decrease in the calculated amount between

formulas under 20-9-366 and in the formula for school major maintenance aid under 20-9-525 to the nearest
whole number by an amount calculated by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of

(b) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year greater than or equal to
97% of the district's general fund maximum budget in the prior year, the amount determined in subsection
(3)(a)(iv) rounded to the nearest cent is the amount of school major maintenance aid per dollar of local effort,
not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the district's school
major maintenance amount.
(c) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year less than 97% of the
district's maximum budget in the prior year, multiply the amount determined in subsection (3)(a)(iv) by the ratio
of the district's adopted general fund budget in the prior year to the district's maximum general fund budget in

any school fiscal year are less than the amount for which school districts would otherwise qualify, the
superintendent of public instruction shall proportionally prorate the aid distributed to ensure that the distributions
do not exceed the appropriated or available funds.
(6) If in any fiscal year the amount of revenue in the school major maintenance aid account is
sufficient to fund school major maintenance aid without a proration reduction pursuant to subsection (5) and if in
that same fiscal year the amount of revenue available in the school facility and technology account established
in 20-9-516 will result in a proration reduction in debt service assistance pursuant to 20-9-346(2)(b) for that

reserve may not be more than 20% of the final transportation fund budget for the ensuing school fiscal year and
is for the purpose of paying transportation fund warrants issued by the district under the final transportation fund
budget.
(4) The district levy requirement for each district's transportation fund must be computed by:
(a) subtracting the schedule amount calculated in subsection (1) from the total preliminary
transportation budget amount; and

levy requirements for the district, and the levy must be made by the county commissioners in accordance with
20-9-142."

Section 20:
Section 15. Section 20-10-145, MCA, is amended to read:
"20-10-145. State transportation reimbursement. (1) A district providing school bus transportation
or individual transportation in accordance with this title, board of public education transportation policy, and
superintendent of public instruction transportation rules must receive a state reimbursement of its transportation
expenditures under the transportation reimbursement rate provisions of 20-10-141 and 20-10-142. The state
transportation reimbursement is one-half three-fourths of the reimbursement amounts established in 20-10-141
and 20-10-142 or one-half of the district's transportation fund budget, whichever is smaller, and must be
computed on the basis of the number of days the transportation services were actually rendered to transport
eligible transportees, as defined in 20-10-101, to or from school to participate in the minimum aggregate hours
of instruction required pursuant to 20-1-301. In determining the amount of the state transportation
reimbursement, an amount claimed by a district may not be considered for reimbursement unless the amount
has been paid in the regular manner provided for the payment of other financial obligations of the district.
(2) Requests for the state transportation reimbursement must be made by each district
semiannually during the school fiscal year on the claim forms and procedure promulgated by the
superintendent of public instruction. The claims for state transportation reimbursements must be routed by the
district to the county superintendent, who after reviewing the claims shall send them to the superintendent of
public instruction. The superintendent of public instruction shall establish the validity and accuracy of the claims
for the state transportation reimbursements by determining compliance with this title, board of public education
transportation policy, and the transportation rules of the superintendent of public instruction. After making any
necessary adjustments to the claims, the superintendent of public instruction shall order a disbursement from
the state money appropriated by the legislature of the state of Montana for the state transportation
reimbursement.
(3) The superintendent of public instruction shall make the disbursement to each school district
- 26 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 483
according to the following schedule:
(a) By September 1 of each year, the superintendent of public instruction shall make a payment
equal to 50% of the state transportation reimbursement paid to the district in the previous school year.
(b) By March 31 of each year, the superintendent of public instruction shall make a payment to the
district equal to the approved amount of state reimbursement for first semester transportation claims less the
amount distributed to the district under subsection (3)(a).
(c) By June 30 of each year, the superintendent of public instruction shall make a payment to the
district to pay the balance of the approved amount due to the district for first and second semester
transportation.
(4) Unless authorized for payment to a school district investment account established under 20-9-
235, the payment of all the district's claims within one county must be made to the county treasurer of the
county, and the county superintendent shall apportion the payment in accordance with the apportionment order
supplied by the superintendent of public instruction.
(5) After adopting a budget amendment for the transportation fund in accordance with 20-9-161
through 20-9-166, the district shall send to the superintendent of public instruction a copy of each new or
amended individual transportation contract and each new or amended bus route form to which the budget
amendment applies. State reimbursement for the additional obligations must be paid as provided in subsection
(1)."

Section 21:
Section 16. Section 20-10-146, MCA, is amended to read:

transportation reimbursement by the county superintendent for school bus transportation or individual
transportation that is actually rendered by a district in accordance with this title, board of public education
transportation policy, and the transportation rules of the superintendent of public instruction must be the same
as one-third the amount of the state transportation reimbursement payment, except that:
(a) if any cash was used to reduce the budgeted county transportation reimbursement under the
provisions of 20-10-144(2)(b), the annual apportionment is limited to the budget amount;
(b) when the county transportation reimbursement for a school bus has been prorated between
- 27 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 483
two or more counties because the school bus is conveying pupils of more than one district located in the
counties, the apportionment of the county transportation reimbursement must be adjusted to pay the amount
computed under the proration; and
(c) when county transportation reimbursement is required under the mandatory attendance
agreement provisions of 20-5-321.
(2) The county transportation net levy requirement for the financing of the county transportation
fund reimbursements to districts is computed by:
(a) totaling the net requirement for all districts of the county, including reimbursements to a special
education cooperative or prorated reimbursements to joint districts or reimbursements under the mandatory
attendance agreement provisions of 20-5-321;
(b) determining the sum of the money available to reduce the county transportation net levy
requirement by adding:
(i) anticipated money that may be realized in the county transportation fund during the ensuing
school fiscal year;
(ii) oil and natural gas production taxes;
(iii) coal gross proceeds taxes under 15-23-703;
(iv) any fund balance available for reappropriation from the end-of-the-year fund balance in the
county transportation fund;
(v) federal forest reserve funds allocated under the provisions of 17-3-213; and
(vi) other revenue anticipated that may be realized in the county transportation fund during the
ensuing school fiscal year; and
(c) subtracting the money available, as determined in subsection (2)(b), to reduce the levy
requirement from the county transportation net levy requirement.
(3) The net levy requirement determined in subsection (2)(c) must be reported to the county
commissioners on or before the later of the first Tuesday in September or within 30 calendar days after
receiving certified taxable values by the county superintendent, and a levy must be set by the county
commissioners in accordance with 20-9-142.
(4) The county superintendent of each county shall submit a report of the revenue amounts used
- 28 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 483
to establish the levy requirements to the superintendent of public instruction on or before September 15. The
report must be completed on forms supplied by the superintendent of public instruction.
(5) The county superintendent shall apportion the county transportation reimbursement from the
proceeds of the county transportation fund. The county superintendent shall order the county treasurer to make
the apportionments in accordance with 20-9-212(2) and after the receipt of the semiannual state transportation
reimbursement payments."

vocational-technical education on the basis of budgets approved by the board of regents."

Section 23:
Section 18. Section 90-6-403, MCA, is amended to read:
"90-6-403. Jurisdictional revenue disparity -- conditioned exemption and reallocation of certain
taxable valuation. (1) When an impact plan for a large-scale mineral development approved pursuant to 90-6-
307 identifies a jurisdictional revenue disparity, the board shall promptly notify the developer, all affected local
government units, and the department of revenue of the disparity. Except as provided in 90-6-404 and this

Section 24:
section, the increase in taxable valuation of the mineral development that occurs after the issuance and
validation of a permit under 82-4-335 is not subject to the usual application of county and school district
property tax mill levies. This increase in taxable valuation must be allocated to local government units as
provided in 90-6-404. The increase in taxable valuation allocated as provided in 90-6-404 is subject to 15-10-
420 and the application of property tax mill levies in the local government unit to which it is allocated. The
increase in taxable valuation allocated to the local government unit is considered newly taxable property in the
recipient local government unit as provided in 15-10-420.
(2) Subject to 15-10-420, the The total taxable valuation of a large-scale mineral development
- 29 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 483
remains subject to the statewide mill levies and basic county levies for elementary and high school BASE
funding programs as provided in 20-9-331 and 20-9-333.
(3) The provisions of subsection (1) remain in effect until the large-scale mineral development
ceases operations or until the existence of the jurisdictional revenue disparity ceases, as determined by the
board."

Section 25:
Section 19. Adjustments to guaranteed tax base multipliers and calculations to mitigate
impacts of reappraisal on property tax relief. (1) The department of revenue and the office of public
instruction shall annually collaborate and jointly assess how reappraisal affects, on a statewide basis, the
portions of funding between guaranteed tax base aid and local property tax responsibilities for the general fund
BASE budgets of school districts and the countywide school retirement funds budgets of counties.
(2) After completing the analysis under subsection (1) and by the May 1 deadline for finalizing
guaranteed tax base aid ratios under 20-9-369, the office of public instruction shall annually adjust the
guaranteed tax base multipliers and calculations outlined in sections 20-9-366 through 20-9-368 to prevent any
statewide increase in property taxes due to the combined effects of reappraisal and the standard guaranteed
tax base aid formulas for the general fund BASE budgets of school districts and the countywide school
retirement funds budgets of counties.

Section 26:
Section 20. School funding adjustments following 2025 legislative session -- duties of
superintendent of public instruction and department of revenue. (1) Following the conclusion of the 2025

superintendent of public instruction an estimate of the revenue in excess of $441.624 million expected to be
generated by the county and statewide school equalization levies under 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360 in
fiscal year 2026.
(2) If the amount reported under subsection (1) is greater than $0 and less than $24.5 million, the

(b) increase the school transportation mileage rates in 20-10-141(2)(a) and (2)(b), as amended by
[this act], by the same percentage, not to exceed 200%, to rates that result in an increase in the distribution of
total state transportation reimbursements to school districts in fiscal year 2026 equal to the amount reported
under subsection (1) of this section. Adjustments to the rates made under this subsection (2)(b) remain in effect
in subsequent fiscal years.
(3) If the amount reported under subsection (1) is equal to or greater than $24.5 million, the
superintendent shall:
(a) increase the school transportation mileage rates pursuant to subsection (2)(b); and
(b) subtract $24.5 million from the amount reported under subsection (1) and use the remainder for
the calculations in subsection (4).
(4) Using the amount determined under subsection (3)(b), the superintendent of public instruction
shall calculate:
(a) first, an increase in the multiplier used in calculating the statewide mill value per elementary
and high school ANB for retirement purposes under 20-9-366, as amended by [this act], for fiscal year 2026
that results in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid for retirement distributed to counties in
fiscal year 2026 that is equal to the amount determined under subsection (3)(b), not to exceed $7.7 million;
(b) then, if money remains, an increase in the multiplier used in calculating the statewide
elementary and high school guaranteed tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets under 20-9-366, as
amended by [this act], for fiscal year 2026 that results in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid
distributed to school districts in fiscal year 2026 that is equal to the amount remaining, not to exceed $17.9
million.

403, MCA; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE AND AN APPLICABILITY DATE.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
Section 1. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
"15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 483
number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
(b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
(c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
labor.
(2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
including newly taxable property.
(3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
(i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
(ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
(iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
(iv) subdivision of real property; and
(v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
(b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
(4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
(i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
(ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
(iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
(b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 483
required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
following tax year.
(c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
(d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
(5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) This section does not apply to:
(a) mills imposed under 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, or 20-25-439;
(a)(b) school district levies established in Title 20 or any other title of the Montana Code Annotated; or
(b)(c) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
(6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
(7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
(a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
(b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
(8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
(9)(8) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
(i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
(ii) a levy to repay taxes paid under protest as provided in 15-1-402;

major maintenance aid account, the superintendent of public instruction shall administer the distribution of
school major maintenance aid from the school major maintenance aid account for deposit in the subfund of the
building reserve fund provided for in 20-9-502(3)(e). Subject to proration under subsection (5) of this section,
aid must be annually distributed no later than the last working day of May to a school district imposing a levy
pursuant to 20-9-502(3) in the current school fiscal year, with the amount of state support per dollar of local
effort of the applicable elementary and high school program of each district determined as follows:

and the district's mill value; and
(iv) divide the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) by the difference resulting from
subtracting the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) from the district's school major maintenance
amount.
(b) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year greater than or equal to
97% of the district's general fund maximum budget in the prior year, the amount determined in subsection
(3)(a)(iv) rounded to the nearest cent is the amount of school major maintenance aid per dollar of local effort,
not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the district's school
major maintenance amount.
(c) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year less than 97% of the
district's maximum budget in the prior year, multiply the amount determined in subsection (3)(a)(iv) by the ratio
of the district's adopted general fund budget in the prior year to the district's maximum general fund budget in
the prior year. The result, rounded to the nearest cent, is the amount of state school major maintenance aid per
dollar of local effort, not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the
district's school major maintenance amount.

amount for the current school year no later than July 31.
(5) If the appropriation from or the available funds in the school major maintenance aid account in
any school fiscal year are less than the amount for which school districts would otherwise qualify, the
superintendent of public instruction shall proportionally prorate the aid distributed to ensure that the distributions
do not exceed the appropriated or available funds.
(6) If in any fiscal year the amount of revenue in the school major maintenance aid account is
sufficient to fund school major maintenance aid without a proration reduction pursuant to subsection (5) and if in
that same fiscal year the amount of revenue available in the school facility and technology account established
in 20-9-516 will result in a proration reduction in debt service assistance pursuant to 20-9-346(2)(b) for that
fiscal year, the state treasurer shall transfer any excess funds in the school major maintenance aid account to
the school facility and technology account, not to exceed the amount required to avoid a proration reduction.

proceeds of the county transportation fund. The county superintendent shall order the county treasurer to make
the apportionments in accordance with 20-9-212(2) and after the receipt of the semiannual state transportation
reimbursement payments."
Section 17. Section 20-25-439, MCA, is amended to read:
"20-25-439. Vocational-technical education -- mill levy required. (1) Subject to 15-10-420, the The
boards of county commissioners of Cascade, Lewis and Clark, Missoula, Silver Bow, and Yellowstone Counties
shall in each calendar year levy a tax of 1 1/2 mills on the dollar value of all taxable property, real and personal,
located within the respective county.
(2) The funds from the mill levy must be deposited in the general fund and must be distributed for
vocational-technical education on the basis of budgets approved by the board of regents."
Section 18. Section 90-6-403, MCA, is amended to read:
"90-6-403. Jurisdictional revenue disparity -- conditioned exemption and reallocation of certain
taxable valuation. (1) When an impact plan for a large-scale mineral development approved pursuant to 90-6-
307 identifies a jurisdictional revenue disparity, the board shall promptly notify the developer, all affected local
government units, and the department of revenue of the disparity. Except as provided in 90-6-404 and this
section, the increase in taxable valuation of the mineral development that occurs after the issuance and
validation of a permit under 82-4-335 is not subject to the usual application of county and school district
property tax mill levies. This increase in taxable valuation must be allocated to local government units as
provided in 90-6-404. The increase in taxable valuation allocated as provided in 90-6-404 is subject to 15-10-
420 and the application of property tax mill levies in the local government unit to which it is allocated. The
increase in taxable valuation allocated to the local government unit is considered newly taxable property in the
recipient local government unit as provided in 15-10-420.
(2) Subject to 15-10-420, the The total taxable valuation of a large-scale mineral development
- 29 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 483
remains subject to the statewide mill levies and basic county levies for elementary and high school BASE
funding programs as provided in 20-9-331 and 20-9-333.
(3) The provisions of subsection (1) remain in effect until the large-scale mineral development
ceases operations or until the existence of the jurisdictional revenue disparity ceases, as determined by the
board."
Section 19. Adjustments to guaranteed tax base multipliers and calculations to mitigate
impacts of reappraisal on property tax relief. (1) The department of revenue and the office of public
instruction shall annually collaborate and jointly assess how reappraisal affects, on a statewide basis, the
portions of funding between guaranteed tax base aid and local property tax responsibilities for the general fund
BASE budgets of school districts and the countywide school retirement funds budgets of counties.
(2) After completing the analysis under subsection (1) and by the May 1 deadline for finalizing
guaranteed tax base aid ratios under 20-9-369, the office of public instruction shall annually adjust the
guaranteed tax base multipliers and calculations outlined in sections 20-9-366 through 20-9-368 to prevent any
statewide increase in property taxes due to the combined effects of reappraisal and the standard guaranteed
tax base aid formulas for the general fund BASE budgets of school districts and the countywide school
retirement funds budgets of counties.
Section 20. School funding adjustments following 2025 legislative session -- duties of
superintendent of public instruction and department of revenue. (1) Following the conclusion of the 2025
legislative session and no later than May 15, 2025, the department of revenue shall provide to the
superintendent of public instruction an estimate of the revenue in excess of $441.624 million expected to be
generated by the county and statewide school equalization levies under 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360 in
fiscal year 2026.
(2) If the amount reported under subsection (1) is greater than $0 and less than $24.5 million, the
superintendent shall:
(a) leave the guaranteed tax base multipliers under 20-9-366, as amended by [this act],
unadjusted; and
- 30 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483

(b) increase the school transportation mileage rates in 20-10-141(2)(a) and (2)(b), as amended by
[this act], by the same percentage, not to exceed 200%, to rates that result in an increase in the distribution of
total state transportation reimbursements to school districts in fiscal year 2026 equal to the amount reported
under subsection (1) of this section. Adjustments to the rates made under this subsection (2)(b) remain in effect
in subsequent fiscal years.
(3) If the amount reported under subsection (1) is equal to or greater than $24.5 million, the
superintendent shall:
(a) increase the school transportation mileage rates pursuant to subsection (2)(b); and
(b) subtract $24.5 million from the amount reported under subsection (1) and use the remainder for
the calculations in subsection (4).
(4) Using the amount determined under subsection (3)(b), the superintendent of public instruction
shall calculate:
(a) first, an increase in the multiplier used in calculating the statewide mill value per elementary
and high school ANB for retirement purposes under 20-9-366, as amended by [this act], for fiscal year 2026
that results in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid for retirement distributed to counties in
fiscal year 2026 that is equal to the amount determined under subsection (3)(b), not to exceed $7.7 million;
(b) then, if money remains, an increase in the multiplier used in calculating the statewide
elementary and high school guaranteed tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets under 20-9-366, as
amended by [this act], for fiscal year 2026 that results in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid
distributed to school districts in fiscal year 2026 that is equal to the amount remaining, not to exceed $17.9
million.

superintendent of public instruction under [section 20 of this act] but the increases may not result in a
"Transportation Aid" appropriation exceeding $36.5 million for either fiscal year; and
(2) the general fund appropriation for "K-12 BASE Aid" in House Bill No. 2 for fiscal year 2026

statewide increase in property taxes due to the combined effects of reappraisal and the standard guaranteed
tax base aid formulas supporting the countywide levy for BASE budget funding support and the countywide
