15 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
16 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
17 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
18 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
19 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
20 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
21 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
22 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
23 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
24 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
25 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
26 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
27 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,

7 state equalization aid as provided in 20-9-343. At fiscal yearend, any fund balance in the account exceeding
8 what was appropriated must be transferred to the guarantee account established in 20-9-622.
9 (2) The account receives revenue as described in 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360.
10 (3) (a) Beginning in fiscal year 2025 2027, each December the superintendent of public instruction
11 shall forecast the amount of revenue the account will receive in that fiscal year by dividing the sum of the
12 taxable value of all property in the state reported by the department of revenue pursuant to 20-9-369 by 1,000
13 to determine a statewide value mill and then multiplying that amount by 95 mills, or the number of mills

15 mills specified in 20-9-331, 20-9-333, and 20-9-360.
16 (b) If the forecasted amount in subsection (3)(a) differs from the amount determined through the
17 same calculation in the prior fiscal year by $2 million or more and is:
18 (a) less by an amount greater than $2 million, then the superintendent shall:
19 (i) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school guaranteed
20 tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number determined by the
21 superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed to eligible school
22 districts equal to 85% of the decrease in the calculated amount between the 2 years; and
23 (ii) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school mill value
24 per ANB for school retirement guaranteed tax base purposes under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number
25 determined by the superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of retirement guaranteed tax base aid
26 distributed to eligible school districts counties equal to 15% of the decrease in the calculated amount between
27 the 2 years;.

11 facility entitlement guaranteed tax base purposes, not to exceed 300%.
12 (c) If the forecasted amount in subsection (3)(a) is greater than the amount determined through
13 the same calculation in the prior fiscal year by more than 105%, the superintendent, using the forecasted
14 amount in excess of 105% of the prior year an amount equal to 50% of the forecasted revenue growth up to
15 revenue growth of 105% of the prior fiscal year revenue plus all forecasted revenue growth above 105% of the
16 prior fiscal year revenue, shall:
17 (i) first increase the multiplier used to calculate statewide mill value per elementary and high
18 school ANB for retirement purposes under 20-9-366, not to exceed 305%, to the nearest whole number
19 determined by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed
20 to eligible counties as close as mathematically possible to the excess amount determined in subsection (3)(c);
