14 Section 1. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
15 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
16 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
17 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
18 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
19 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
20 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
21 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
22 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
23 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
24 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
25 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
26 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
27 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
28 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0483.2
1 labor.
2 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
3 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
4 including newly taxable property.
5 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
6 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
7 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
8 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
9 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
10 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
11 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
12 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
13 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
14 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
15 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
16 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
17 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
18 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
19 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
20 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
21 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
22 following tax year.
23 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
24 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
25 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
26 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
27 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
28 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).

12 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
13 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must

15 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.

11 subsection (2) for school transportation constitute the maximum reimbursement to districts for school
12 transportation from state and county sources of transportation revenue under the provisions of 20-10-145 and
13 20-10-146. These rates may not limit the amount that a district may budget in its transportation fund budget in

15 year. All bus miles traveled on bus routes approved by the county transportation committee are reimbursable.
16 Nonbus mileage is reimbursable for a vehicle driven by a bus driver to and from an overnight location of a
17 school bus when the location is more than 10 miles from the school. A district may approve additional bus or
18 nonbus miles within its own district or approved service area but may not claim reimbursement for the mileage.

22 (1) The "schedule amount" of the budget expenditures that is derived from the rate schedules in
23 20-10-141 and 20-10-142 must be determined by adding the following amounts:
24 (a) the sum of the maximum reimbursable expenditures for all approved school bus routes

13 budgeted on the following basis:
14 (i) one-half three-fourths is the budgeted state transportation reimbursement; and
15 (ii) one-half one-fourth is the budgeted county transportation fund reimbursement and must be
16 financed in the manner provided in 20-10-146.
17 (b) When the district has a sufficient amount of fund balance for reappropriation and other sources
18 of district revenue, as determined in subsection (3), to reduce the total district obligation for financing to zero,
19 any remaining amount of district revenue and fund balance reappropriated must be used to reduce the county
20 financing obligation in subsection (2)(a)(ii) and, if the county financing obligations are reduced to zero, to
21 reduce the state financial obligation in subsection (2)(a)(i).
22 (c) The county revenue requirement for a joint district, after the application of any district money
23 under subsection (2)(b), must be prorated to each county incorporated by the joint district in the same
24 proportion as the ANB of the joint district is distributed by pupil residence in each county.

10 through 20-5-324;
11 (h) any other revenue anticipated by the trustees to be earned during the ensuing school fiscal
12 year that may be used to finance the transportation fund; and
13 (i) any fund balance available for reappropriation as determined by subtracting the amount of the
14 end-of-the-year fund balance earmarked as the transportation fund operating reserve for the ensuing school
15 fiscal year by the trustees from the end-of-the-year fund balance in the transportation fund. The operating
16 reserve may not be more than 20% of the final transportation fund budget for the ensuing school fiscal year and
17 is for the purpose of paying transportation fund warrants issued by the district under the final transportation fund
18 budget.
19 (4) The district levy requirement for each district's transportation fund must be computed by:
20 (a) subtracting the schedule amount calculated in subsection (1) from the total preliminary
21 transportation budget amount; and
22 (b) subtracting the amount of money available to reduce the property tax on the district, as
23 determined in subsection (3), from the amount determined in subsection (4)(a).

14 Section 1. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
15 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
16 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
17 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
18 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
19 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
20 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
21 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
22 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
23 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
24 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
25 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
26 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
27 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
28 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0483.2
1 labor.
2 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
3 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
4 including newly taxable property.
5 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
6 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
7 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
8 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
9 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
10 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
11 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
12 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
13 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
14 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
15 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
16 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
17 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
18 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
19 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
20 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
21 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
22 following tax year.
23 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
24 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
25 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
26 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
27 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
28 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).

1 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) This section does not apply to:
2 (a) mills imposed under 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, or 20-25-439;
3 (a)(b) school district levies established in Title 20 or any other title of the Montana Code Annotated; or
4 (b)(c) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
5 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
6 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
7 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
8 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
9 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
10 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
11 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
12 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
13 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
14 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
15 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
16 (9)(8) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
17 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;
18 (ii) a levy to repay taxes paid under protest as provided in 15-1-402;

21 (v) a levy for the support of a newly established regional resource authority;
22 (vi) the portion that is the amount in excess of the base contribution of a governmental entity's
23 property tax levy for contributions for group benefits excluded under 2-9-212 or 2-18-703;
24 (vii) a levy for reimbursing a county for costs incurred in transferring property records to an
25 adjoining county under 7-2-2807 upon relocation of a county boundary;
26 (viii) a levy used to fund the sheriffs' retirement system under 19-7-404(3)(b); or
27 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
28 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483

- 2025

6 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
7 authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated
8 operating funds by a county or municipality during that time.
9 (11)(10)The department may adopt rules to implement this section. The rules may include a method for

16 aid must be annually distributed no later than the last working day of May to a school district imposing a levy
17 pursuant to 20-9-502(3) in the current school fiscal year, with the amount of state support per dollar of local
18 effort of the applicable elementary and high school program of each district determined as follows:
19 (i) using the taxable valuation most recently determined by the department of revenue under 20-9-
20 369:
21 (A) divide the total statewide taxable valuation by the statewide total of school major maintenance
22 amounts and, subject to adjustment under 20-9-336, multiply the result by 187%;

4 and the district's mill value; and
5 (iv) divide the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) by the difference resulting from
6 subtracting the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) from the district's school major maintenance
7 amount.
8 (b) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year greater than or equal to
9 97% of the district's general fund maximum budget in the prior year, the amount determined in subsection
10 (3)(a)(iv) rounded to the nearest cent is the amount of school major maintenance aid per dollar of local effort,
11 not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the district's school
12 major maintenance amount.
13 (c) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year less than 97% of the
14 district's maximum budget in the prior year, multiply the amount determined in subsection (3)(a)(iv) by the ratio
15 of the district's adopted general fund budget in the prior year to the district's maximum general fund budget in
16 the prior year. The result, rounded to the nearest cent, is the amount of state school major maintenance aid per
17 dollar of local effort, not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the
18 district's school major maintenance amount.

22 amount for the current school year no later than July 31.
23 (5) If the appropriation from or the available funds in the school major maintenance aid account in
24 any school fiscal year are less than the amount for which school districts would otherwise qualify, the
25 superintendent of public instruction shall proportionally prorate the aid distributed to ensure that the distributions
26 do not exceed the appropriated or available funds.
27 (6) If in any fiscal year the amount of revenue in the school major maintenance aid account is
28 sufficient to fund school major maintenance aid without a proration reduction pursuant to subsection (5) and if in

14 end-of-the-year fund balance earmarked as the transportation fund operating reserve for the ensuing school
15 fiscal year by the trustees from the end-of-the-year fund balance in the transportation fund. The operating
16 reserve may not be more than 20% of the final transportation fund budget for the ensuing school fiscal year and
17 is for the purpose of paying transportation fund warrants issued by the district under the final transportation fund
