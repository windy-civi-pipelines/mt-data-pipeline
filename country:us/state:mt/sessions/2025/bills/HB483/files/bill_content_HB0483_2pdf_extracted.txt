19 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
20 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
21 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
22 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
23 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
24 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
25 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
26 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
27 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
28 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill

69th Legislature 2025 HB0483.2
1 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
2 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
3 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
4 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
5 labor.
6 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
7 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
8 including newly taxable property.
9 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
10 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
11 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
12 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
13 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
14 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
15 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
16 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
17 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
18 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
19 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
20 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
21 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
22 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
23 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
24 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
25 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
26 following tax year.
27 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
28 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current

1 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
2 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale

11 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
12 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
13 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
14 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
15 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
16 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
17 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
18 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
19 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
20 (9)(8) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:

19 year. All bus miles traveled on bus routes approved by the county transportation committee are reimbursable.
20 Nonbus mileage is reimbursable for a vehicle driven by a bus driver to and from an overnight location of a
21 school bus when the location is more than 10 miles from the school. A district may approve additional bus or
22 nonbus miles within its own district or approved service area but may not claim reimbursement for the mileage.

12 (b) Nonbus mileage, as provided in subsection (1), must be reimbursed at a rate of 50 cents $1.00
13 50 CENTS a mile.
14 (3) The rated capacity is the number of passenger seating positions of a school bus as determined
15 under the policy adopted by the board of public education. If modification of a school bus to accommodate
16 pupils with disabilities reduces the rated capacity of the bus, the reimbursement to a district for pupil
17 transportation is based on the rated capacity of the bus prior to modification.
18 (4) The number of pupils riding the school bus may not exceed the passenger seating positions of

26 (1) The "schedule amount" of the budget expenditures that is derived from the rate schedules in
27 20-10-141 and 20-10-142 must be determined by adding the following amounts:
28 (a) the sum of the maximum reimbursable expenditures for all approved school bus routes

69th Legislature 2025 HB0483.2
1 maintained by the district (to determine the maximum reimbursable expenditure, multiply the applicable rate for
2 each bus mile by the total number of miles to be traveled during the ensuing school fiscal year on each bus
3 route approved by the county transportation committee and maintained by the district); plus
4 (b) the total of all individual transportation per diem reimbursement rates for the district as
5 determined from the contracts submitted by the district multiplied by the number of pupil-instruction days

17 budgeted on the following basis:
18 (i) one-half three-fourths is the budgeted state transportation reimbursement; and
19 (ii) one-half one-fourth is the budgeted county transportation fund reimbursement and must be
20 financed in the manner provided in 20-10-146.
21 (b) When the district has a sufficient amount of fund balance for reappropriation and other sources
22 of district revenue, as determined in subsection (3), to reduce the total district obligation for financing to zero,
23 any remaining amount of district revenue and fund balance reappropriated must be used to reduce the county
24 financing obligation in subsection (2)(a)(ii) and, if the county financing obligations are reduced to zero, to
25 reduce the state financial obligation in subsection (2)(a)(i).
26 (c) The county revenue requirement for a joint district, after the application of any district money
27 under subsection (2)(b), must be prorated to each county incorporated by the joint district in the same
28 proportion as the ANB of the joint district is distributed by pupil residence in each county.

18 end-of-the-year fund balance earmarked as the transportation fund operating reserve for the ensuing school
19 fiscal year by the trustees from the end-of-the-year fund balance in the transportation fund. The operating
20 reserve may not be more than 20% of the final transportation fund budget for the ensuing school fiscal year and
21 is for the purpose of paying transportation fund warrants issued by the district under the final transportation fund
22 budget.
23 (4) The district levy requirement for each district's transportation fund must be computed by:

19 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
20 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
21 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
22 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
23 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
24 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
25 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
26 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
27 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
28 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0483.2
1 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
2 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
3 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
4 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
5 labor.
6 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
7 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
8 including newly taxable property.
9 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:
10 (i) annexation of real property and improvements into a taxing unit;
11 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
12 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
13 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
14 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
15 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
16 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
17 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
18 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
19 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
20 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
21 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
22 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
23 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
24 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
25 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
26 following tax year.
27 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
28 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
- 4 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0483.2
1 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
2 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
3 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
4 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
5 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) This section does not apply to:
6 (a) mills imposed under 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, or 20-25-439;
7 (a)(b) school district levies established in Title 20 or any other title of the Montana Code Annotated; or
8 (b)(c) a mill levy imposed for a newly created regional resource authority.
9 (6) For purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds taxes
10 received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.
11 (7) In determining the maximum number of mills in subsection (1)(a), the governmental entity:
12 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
13 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
14 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
15 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
16 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
17 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
18 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
19 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
20 (9)(8) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
21 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

3 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior

5 The levy under this subsection (9)(a)(ix) (8)(a)(ix) is limited to the amount in the resolution creating the
6 authority.
7 (b) A levy authorized under subsection (9)(a) (8)(a) may not be included in the amount of property
8 taxes actually assessed in a subsequent year.
9 (10)(9) A governmental entity may levy mills for the support of airports as authorized in 67-10-402, 67-
10 11-301, or 67-11-302 even though the governmental entity has not imposed a levy for the airport or the airport
11 authority in either of the previous 2 years and the airport or airport authority has not been appropriated
12 operating funds by a county or municipality during that time.
13 (11)(10)The department may adopt rules to implement this section. The rules may include a method for

23 (i) using the taxable valuation most recently determined by the department of revenue under 20-9-
24 369:
25 (A) divide the total statewide taxable valuation by the statewide total of school major maintenance
26 amounts and, subject to adjustment under 20-9-336, multiply the result by 187%;

28 maintenance amount;
- 20 - Authorized Print Version – HB 483

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0483.2
1 (C) subtract the district's taxable valuation from the amount determined under subsection

8 and the district's mill value; and
9 (iv) divide the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) by the difference resulting from
10 subtracting the result determined under subsection (3)(a)(iii) from the district's school major maintenance
11 amount.
12 (b) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year greater than or equal to
13 97% of the district's general fund maximum budget in the prior year, the amount determined in subsection
14 (3)(a)(iv) rounded to the nearest cent is the amount of school major maintenance aid per dollar of local effort,
15 not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the district's school
16 major maintenance amount.
17 (c) For a district with an adopted general fund budget in the prior year less than 97% of the
18 district's maximum budget in the prior year, multiply the amount determined in subsection (3)(a)(iv) by the ratio
19 of the district's adopted general fund budget in the prior year to the district's maximum general fund budget in
20 the prior year. The result, rounded to the nearest cent, is the amount of state school major maintenance aid per
21 dollar of local effort, not to exceed an amount that would result in the state aid composing more than 80% of the
22 district's school major maintenance amount.

1 superintendent of public instruction shall proportionally prorate the aid distributed to ensure that the distributions
2 do not exceed the appropriated or available funds.
3 (6) If in any fiscal year the amount of revenue in the school major maintenance aid account is
4 sufficient to fund school major maintenance aid without a proration reduction pursuant to subsection (5) and if in
5 that same fiscal year the amount of revenue available in the school facility and technology account established
6 in 20-9-516 will result in a proration reduction in debt service assistance pursuant to 20-9-346(2)(b) for that
