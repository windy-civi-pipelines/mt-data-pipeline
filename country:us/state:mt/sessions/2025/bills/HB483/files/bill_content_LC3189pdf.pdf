9 Section 2. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
10 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of this section, a
11 governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to generate the amount
12 of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3
13 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is established by calculating the
14 number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually assessed in the governmental unit in
15 the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current year's newly taxable value, plus one-half
16 of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
17 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
18 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
19 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
20 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
21 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
22 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
23 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
24 labor.
25 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
26 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,
27 including newly taxable property.
28 (3) (a) For purposes of this section, newly taxable property includes:

2 (ii) construction, expansion, or remodeling of improvements;
3 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
4 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
5 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
6 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
7 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
8 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
9 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
10 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
11 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
12 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
13 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
14 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
15 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
16 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
17 following tax year.
18 (c) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property that was
19 constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the current
20 year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
21 (d) For the purpose of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the first sale
22 of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as
23 nonqualified agricultural land as described in 15-6-133(1)(c).
24 (5) Subject to subsection (8), subsection (1)(a) This section does not apply to:
25 (a) mills imposed under 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, or 20-25-439;

3 (a) may increase the number of mills to account for a decrease in reimbursements; and
4 (b) may not increase the number of mills to account for a loss of tax base because of legislative
5 action that is reimbursed under the provisions of 15-1-121(7).
6 (8) The department shall calculate, on a statewide basis, the number of mills to be imposed for
7 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
8 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
9 be established in tenths of mills. If the mill levy calculation does not result in an even tenth of a mill, then the
10 calculation must be rounded up to the nearest tenth of a mill.
11 (9) (8) (a) The provisions of subsection (1) do not prevent or restrict:
12 (i) a judgment levy under 2-9-316, 7-6-4015, or 7-7-2202;

22 (ix) a governmental entity from levying mills for the support of an airport authority in existence prior
23 to May 7, 2019, regardless of the amount of the levy imposed for the support of the airport authority in the past.

25 authority.

2 transportation from state and county sources of transportation revenue under the provisions of 20-10-145 and
3 20-10-146. These rates may not limit the amount that a district may budget in its transportation fund budget in
4 order to provide for the estimated and necessary cost of school transportation during the ensuing school fiscal
5 year. All bus miles traveled on bus routes approved by the county transportation committee are reimbursable.
6 Nonbus mileage is reimbursable for a vehicle driven by a bus driver to and from an overnight location of a
7 school bus when the location is more than 10 miles from the school. A district may approve additional bus or
8 nonbus miles within its own district or approved service area but may not claim reimbursement for the mileage.
9 Any vehicle, the operation of which is reimbursed for bus mileage under the rate provisions of this schedule,
10 must be a school bus, as defined by this title, driven by a qualified driver on a bus route approved by the county
11 transportation committee and the superintendent of public instruction.
12 (2) (a) The rate for each bus mile traveled must be determined in accordance with the following
13 schedule:

21 (b) Nonbus mileage, as provided in subsection (1), must be reimbursed at a rate of 50 cents $1.00
22 a mile.
23 (3) The rated capacity is the number of passenger seating positions of a school bus as determined
24 under the policy adopted by the board of public education. If modification of a school bus to accommodate
25 pupils with disabilities reduces the rated capacity of the bus, the reimbursement to a district for pupil
26 transportation is based on the rated capacity of the bus prior to modification.
27 (4) The number of pupils riding the school bus may not exceed the passenger seating positions of
28 the bus."

4 fund budget. Before the second Monday of August, the county superintendent shall compute the revenue
5 available to finance the transportation fund budget of each district. The county superintendent shall compute
6 the revenue for each district on the following basis:
7 (1) The "schedule amount" of the budget expenditures that is derived from the rate schedules in
8 20-10-141 and 20-10-142 must be determined by adding the following amounts:
9 (a) the sum of the maximum reimbursable expenditures for all approved school bus routes
10 maintained by the district (to determine the maximum reimbursable expenditure, multiply the applicable rate for
11 each bus mile by the total number of miles to be traveled during the ensuing school fiscal year on each bus
12 route approved by the county transportation committee and maintained by the district); plus
13 (b) the total of all individual transportation per diem reimbursement rates for the district as
14 determined from the contracts submitted by the district multiplied by the number of pupil-instruction days
15 scheduled for the ensuing school attendance year; plus

23 approval to attend school in a district outside the district of residence.
24 (2) (a) The schedule amount determined in subsection (1) or the total transportation fund budget,

2 (b) When the district has a sufficient amount of fund balance for reappropriation and other sources
3 of district revenue, as determined in subsection (3), to reduce the total district obligation for financing to zero,
4 any remaining amount of district revenue and fund balance reappropriated must be used to reduce the county
5 financing obligation in subsection (2)(a)(ii) and, if the county financing obligations are reduced to zero, to
6 reduce the state financial obligation in subsection (2)(a)(i).
7 (c) The county revenue requirement for a joint district, after the application of any district money
8 under subsection (2)(b), must be prorated to each county incorporated by the joint district in the same
9 proportion as the ANB of the joint district is distributed by pupil residence in each county.
10 (3) The total of the money available for the reduction of property tax on the district for the
11 transportation fund must be determined by totaling:
12 (a) anticipated federal money received under the provisions of 20 U.S.C. 7701, et seq., or other
13 anticipated federal money received in lieu of that federal act;
14 (b) anticipated payments from other districts for providing school bus transportation services for

27 end-of-the-year fund balance earmarked as the transportation fund operating reserve for the ensuing school
28 fiscal year by the trustees from the end-of-the-year fund balance in the transportation fund. The operating

1 reserve may not be more than 20% of the final transportation fund budget for the ensuing school fiscal year and
2 is for the purpose of paying transportation fund warrants issued by the district under the final transportation fund
3 budget.
4 (4) The district levy requirement for each district's transportation fund must be computed by:
5 (a) subtracting the schedule amount calculated in subsection (1) from the total preliminary
6 transportation budget amount; and
7 (b) subtracting the amount of money available to reduce the property tax on the district, as
8 determined in subsection (3), from the amount determined in subsection (4)(a).
