(a) corrective action costs as required by a department-approved corrective action plan, except
that if the corrective action plan:

storage tank, the board may reimburse only the costs that would have reasonably been incurred if the only
release at the site was the release of the petroleum or petroleum products from the eligible petroleum storage
tank;

(a) corrective action costs or the costs of bodily injury or property damage paid to third parties that
are determined by the board to be ineligible for reimbursement;
(b) costs for bodily injury and property damage, other than corrective action costs, incurred by the
owner or operator;
(c) penalties or payments for damages incurred under actions by the department, board, or
federal, state, local, or tribal agencies or other government entities involving judicial or administrative
enforcement activities and related negotiations;
(d) attorney fees and legal costs of the owner, the operator, or a third party;
(e) costs for the repair or replacement of a tank or piping or costs of other materials, equipment, or
labor related to the operation, repair, or replacement of a tank or piping;
(f) expenses incurred before April 13, 1989 January 1, 1984, for owners or operators seeking
reimbursement from the petroleum tank release cleanup fund and expenses incurred before May 15, 1991, for
owners or operators seeking reimbursement from the petroleum tank release cleanup fund for a tank storing
heating oil for consumptive use on the premises where it is stored or for a farm or residential tank with a
capacity of 1,100 gallons or less that is used for storing motor fuel for noncommercial purposes;
(g) expenses exceeding the maximum reimbursements provided for in subsection (4);
(h) costs for which an owner or operator has received reimbursement or payment from an insurer
or other third party, including a grantor;

compensation paid to third parties for bodily injury or property damage. The running of the 5-year limitation
period is suspended by an appeal of the board's denial of eligibility for reimbursement. If a written request for
hearing is filed under 75-11-309, the suspension of the 5-year limitation period is effective from the date of the
board's initial eligibility denial to the date on which the initial eligibility denial is overturned or reversed by the
board, a district court, or the state supreme court, whichever occurs latest. The board may grant reasonable
extensions of this limitation period if it is shown that the need for the extension is not due to the negligence of
the owner or operator or agent of the owner or operator.
(j) costs that the board has determined are not reasonable costs of responding to the release and

after April 13, 1989 January 1, 1984, from a tank storing heating oil for consumptive use on the premises where
it is stored or from a farm or residential tank with a capacity of 1,100 gallons or less that is used for storing
motor fuel for noncommercial purposes, the board shall reimburse an owner or operator for:

(c) except for the amount considered to have been paid by the owner or operator pursuant to
subsection (5)(a), are considered to have been reimbursed from the fund for purposes of determining when the
board has paid the maximum amount payable from the fund under subsection (4)(a)(ii) or (4)(b)(ii).
(6) If the ending monthly balance of the fund is less than $1.5 million, excluding a reimbursement
for a cost associated with an emergency response, a reimbursement may not be made and the fund and the

first had knowledge of the tank and closes the tank in accordance with the requirements of the permit before
the permit expires; and
