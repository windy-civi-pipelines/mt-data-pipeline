19 (b) be made available to the public;

23 provided in 76-25-503.
24 (14)(15)Any changes to an approved preliminary plat that increases the number of lots or redesigns or
25 rearranges six or more lots must undergo consideration and approval of an amended plat following the

2 SECTION 13. SECTION 76-25-410, MCA, IS AMENDED TO READ:
3 "76-25-410. Local review procedure for final plats. (1) The following must be submitted with a final
4 plat application:
5 (a) information demonstrating the final plat conforms to the written decision and all conditions of
6 approval set forth on the preliminary plat;
7 (b) a plat that meets the survey requirements provided in 76-25-412(1); and
8 (c) confirmation the county treasurer has certified that all real property taxes and special
9 assessments assessed and levied on the land to be subdivided have been paid.
10 (2) The final plat may be required to be reviewed for errors and omissions in calculation or drafting
11 by an examining land surveyor before filing with the county clerk and recorder. The examining land surveyor
12 shall certify compliance in a printed or stamped certificate signed by the surveyor on the final plat. A
13 professional land surveyor may not act as an examining land surveyor in regard to a plat in which the surveyor
14 has a financial or personal interest.
15 (3) A final plat application is considered received on the date the application is delivered to the
16 governing body or the agent or agency designated by the governing body if accompanied by the review fee.
17 (4) (a) Within 10 business days of receipt of a final plat, the planning administrator shall determine
18 whether the final plat contains the information required under subsection (1) and shall notify the subdivider in
19 writing.
20 (b) If the planning administrator determines that the final plat does not contain the information
21 required under subsection (1), the planning administrator shall identify the final plat's defects in the notification.
22 (c) The planning administrator may review subsequent submissions of the final plat only for
23 information found to be deficient during the original review of the final plat under subsection (4)(a).
24 (d) A determination that the application for a final plat contains sufficient information for review as
25 provided in subsection (4)(a) does not ensure approval of the final plat and does not limit the ability of the
26 planning administrator to request additional information during the review process.
27 (5) Once a determination is made under subsection (4) that the final plat contains the information
28 required under subsection (1), the governing body shall review and approve or deny the final plat within 20

1 business days.
2 (6) The subdivider or the subdivider's agent and the governing body or its reviewing agent or
3 agency may mutually agree to extend the review periods provided for in this section.
4 (7) (a) For a period of 5 years after approval of a phased preliminary plat, the subdivider may apply
5 for final plat of any one or more phases following the process set forth in subsections (1) through (6).
6 (b) After 5 years have elapsed since approval of a phased preliminary plat, the planning
7 administrator shall review each remaining phase to determine if a phase may result in new or significantly
8 increased potential impacts that have not been previously identified and considered in the adoption of the land
9 use plan, zoning or subdivision regulations, or review and approval of the phased preliminary plat. If the
10 planning administrator identifies any new or significantly increased potential impacts not previously identified
11 and considered, the planning administrator shall proceed as set forth in 76-25-408(8) (9).
12 (c) If necessary to mitigate impacts identified in subsection (7)(b), the planning administrator may
13 impose conditions on any phase before final plat approval is sought."
