13 Section 1. Section 15-10-420, MCA, is amended to read:
14 "15-10-420. Procedure for calculating levy. (1) (a) Subject to the provisions of 15-10-425(2)(b) and
15 this section, a governmental entity that is authorized to impose mills may impose a mill levy sufficient to
16 generate the amount of property taxes actually assessed in the prior year plus one-half of the average rate of
17 inflation for the prior 3 years. The maximum number of mills that a governmental entity may impose is
18 established by calculating the number of mills required to generate the amount of property tax actually
19 assessed in the governmental unit in the prior year based on the current year taxable value, less the current
20 year's newly taxable value, plus one-half of the average rate of inflation for the prior 3 years.
21 (b) A governmental entity that does not impose the maximum number of mills authorized under
22 subsection (1)(a) may carry forward the authority to impose the number of mills equal to the difference between
23 the actual number of mills imposed and the maximum number of mills authorized to be imposed. The mill
24 authority carried forward may be imposed in a subsequent tax year.
25 (c) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), the department shall calculate one-half of the average
26 rate of inflation for the prior 3 years by using the consumer price index, U.S. city average, all urban consumers,
27 using the 1982-84 base of 100, as published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of
28 labor.

1 (2) A governmental entity may apply the levy calculated pursuant to subsection (1)(a) plus any
2 additional levies authorized by the voters, as provided in 15-10-425, to all property in the governmental unit,

7 (iii) transfer of property into a taxing unit;
8 (iv) subdivision of real property; and
9 (v) transfer of property from tax-exempt to taxable status.
10 (b) Newly taxable property does not include an increase in value that arises because of an
11 increase in the incremental value within a tax increment financing district.
12 (4) (a) For the purposes of subsection (1), the taxable value of newly taxable property includes the
13 release of taxable value from the incremental taxable value of a tax increment financing district because of:
14 (i) a change in the boundary of a tax increment financing district;
15 (ii) an increase in the base value of the tax increment financing district pursuant to 7-15-4287; or
16 (iii) the termination of a tax increment financing district.
17 (b) If a tax increment financing district terminates prior to the certification of taxable values as
18 required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the year in which the tax
19 increment financing district terminates. If a tax increment financing district terminates after the certification of
20 taxable values as required in 15-10-202, the increment value is reported as newly taxable property in the
21 following tax year.
22 (c) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(ii), the value of newly taxable class four property
23 that was constructed, expanded, or remodeled property since the completion of the last reappraisal cycle is the
24 current year market value of that property less the previous year market value of that property.
25 (d) For the purpose purposes of subsection (3)(a)(iv), the subdivision of real property includes the
26 first sale of real property that results in the property being taxable as class four property under 15-6-134 or as

3 (6) For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), taxes imposed do not include net or gross proceeds
4 taxes received under 15-6-131 and 15-6-132.

10 purposes of 15-10-109, 20-9-331, 20-9-333, 20-9-360, and 20-25-439. However, the number of mills calculated
11 by the department may not exceed the mill levy limits established in those sections. The mill calculation must
