14 an appropriation right with the intention of wholly or partially abandoning the right or if the appropriator ceases
15 using the appropriation right according to its terms and conditions with the intention of not complying with those
16 terms and conditions, the appropriation right is, to that extent, considered abandoned and must immediately
17 expire.
18 (2) If an appropriator ceases to use all or part of an appropriation right or ceases using the
19 appropriation right according to its terms and conditions for a period of 10 successive years and there was
20 water available for use, there is a prima facie presumption that the appropriator has abandoned the right for the
21 part not used.

5 does not constitute an abandonment or serve as evidence that could be used to establish an abandonment of
