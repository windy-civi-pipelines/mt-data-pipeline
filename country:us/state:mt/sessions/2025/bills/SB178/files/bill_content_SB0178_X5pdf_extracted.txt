expire.
(2) If an appropriator ceases to use all or part of an appropriation right or ceases using the
appropriation right according to its terms and conditions for a period of 10 successive years and there was
water available for use, there is a prima facie presumption that the appropriator has abandoned the right for the
part not used.

intent by the appropriator to wholly or partially abandon the appropriation right or to not comply with the terms

contract may not create or may not be added to any previous period of nonuse to create a prima facie
presumption of abandonment.

right pursuant to 85-2-407 or 85-2-408, or a temporary lease of an appropriation right pursuant to [section 1]
does not constitute an abandonment or serve as evidence that could be used to establish an abandonment of
any part of the right.
(5) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to existing rights until they have been finally determined in

using the appropriation right according to its terms and conditions with the intention of not complying with those
terms and conditions, the appropriation right is, to that extent, considered abandoned and must immediately
expire.
(2) If an appropriator ceases to use all or part of an appropriation right or ceases using the
appropriation right according to its terms and conditions for a period of 10 successive years and there was
water available for use, there is a prima facie presumption that the appropriator has abandoned the right for the
part not used.
(3) If an appropriator ceases to use all or part of an appropriation right in compliance with a
candidate conservation agreement initiated pursuant to 50 CFR 17.32 or because the land to which the water is
applied to a beneficial use is contracted under a state or federal conservation set-aside program:

intent by the appropriator to wholly or partially abandon the appropriation right or to not comply with the terms
and conditions attached to the right; and

contract may not create or may not be added to any previous period of nonuse to create a prima facie
presumption of abandonment.

right pursuant to 85-2-407 or 85-2-408, or a temporary lease of an appropriation right pursuant to [section 1]
