1 Section 3. Section 85-2-404, MCA, is amended to read:
2 "85-2-404. Abandonment of appropriation right. (1) If an appropriator ceases to use all or a part of
3 an appropriation right with the intention of wholly or partially abandoning the right or if the appropriator ceases
4 using the appropriation right according to its terms and conditions with the intention of not complying with those
5 terms and conditions, the appropriation right is, to that extent, considered abandoned and must immediately
6 expire.
7 (2) If an appropriator ceases to use all or part of an appropriation right or ceases using the
8 appropriation right according to its terms and conditions for a period of 10 successive years and there was
9 water available for use, there is a prima facie presumption that the appropriator has abandoned the right for the
10 part not used.
11 (3) If an appropriator ceases to use all or part of an appropriation right in compliance with a
12 candidate conservation agreement initiated pursuant to 50 CFR 17.32 or because the land to which the water is
13 applied to a beneficial use is contracted under a state or federal conservation set-aside program:
14 (a) the set-aside and resulting reduction in use of the appropriation right does not represent an
15 intent by the appropriator to wholly or partially abandon the appropriation right or to not comply with the terms
16 and conditions attached to the right; and
17 (b) the period of nonuse that occurs for part or all of the appropriation right as a result of the
18 contract may not create or may not be added to any previous period of nonuse to create a prima facie
19 presumption of abandonment.
20 (4) The lease of an existing right pursuant to 85-2-436, or a temporary change in appropriation
21 right pursuant to 85-2-407 or 85-2-408, or a temporary lease of an appropriation right pursuant to [section 1]
22 does not constitute an abandonment or serve as evidence that could be used to establish an abandonment of
23 any part of the right.
24 (5) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to existing rights until they have been finally determined in
25 accordance with part 2 of this chapter."
26
27 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Codification instruction. [Section 1] is intended to be codified as an
28 integral part of Title 85, chapter 2, part 4, and the provisions of Title 85, chapter 2, part 4, apply to [section 1].

1 Section 3. Section 85-2-404, MCA, is amended to read:
2 "85-2-404. Abandonment of appropriation right. (1) If an appropriator ceases to use all or a part of
3 an appropriation right with the intention of wholly or partially abandoning the right or if the appropriator ceases
4 using the appropriation right according to its terms and conditions with the intention of not complying with those
5 terms and conditions, the appropriation right is, to that extent, considered abandoned and must immediately
6 expire.
7 (2) If an appropriator ceases to use all or part of an appropriation right or ceases using the
8 appropriation right according to its terms and conditions for a period of 10 successive years and there was
9 water available for use, there is a prima facie presumption that the appropriator has abandoned the right for the
10 part not used.
11 (3) If an appropriator ceases to use all or part of an appropriation right in compliance with a
12 candidate conservation agreement initiated pursuant to 50 CFR 17.32 or because the land to which the water is
13 applied to a beneficial use is contracted under a state or federal conservation set-aside program:
14 (a) the set-aside and resulting reduction in use of the appropriation right does not represent an
15 intent by the appropriator to wholly or partially abandon the appropriation right or to not comply with the terms
16 and conditions attached to the right; and
17 (b) the period of nonuse that occurs for part or all of the appropriation right as a result of the
18 contract may not create or may not be added to any previous period of nonuse to create a prima facie
19 presumption of abandonment.
20 (4) The lease of an existing right pursuant to 85-2-436, or a temporary change in appropriation
21 right pursuant to 85-2-407 or 85-2-408, or a temporary lease of an appropriation right pursuant to [section 1]
22 does not constitute an abandonment or serve as evidence that could be used to establish an abandonment of
23 any part of the right.
24 (5) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to existing rights until they have been finally determined in
25 accordance with part 2 of this chapter."

27 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Codification instruction. [Section 1] is intended to be codified as an
28 integral part of Title 85, chapter 2, part 4, and the provisions of Title 85, chapter 2, part 4, apply to [section 1].
