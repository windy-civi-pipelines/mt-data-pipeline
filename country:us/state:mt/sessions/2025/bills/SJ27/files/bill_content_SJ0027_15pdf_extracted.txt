6 MONTANA URGING THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO TAKE ACTION REGARDING LIVESTOCK
7 BRUCELLOSIS VACCINATIONS.
8
9 WHEREAS, brucellosis, also known as "Contagious Abortion" or "Bang's Disease," is the most
10 common zoonotic disease, described by the United States Department of Agriculture as "a contagious,
11 infectious, and communicable disease, primarily affecting cattle, bison, and swine, and is caused by bacteria of
12 the genus Brucella;" and
13 WHEREAS, brucellosis is known to cause stillbirth, loss of young, reduced milk production, and
14 infertility in livestock; and
15 WHEREAS, there are no successful, affordable treatments for brucellosis in livestock, meaning that
16 vaccination is the only available method of control or prevention of brucellosis; and
17 WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature maintains that it is in the best interest of all Montanans to have
18 protection from the highly infectious Brucellosis disease; and
19 WHEREAS, the Montana Department of Livestock requires that all sexually intact female cattle or
20 domestic bison 12 months of age or older in Beaverhead, Big Horn, Broadwater, Carbon, Gallatin, Jefferson,
21 Madison, Park, Stillwater, and Sweet Grass counties must be vaccinated against brucellosis. These vaccination
22 requirements apply to resident cattle in the listed Montana counties, as well as cattle seasonally grazing in the
23 counties. Other department rule requires brucellosis testing when leaving the Designated Surveillance Area,
24 summer grazing in the Designated Surveillance Area, or changing ownership; and
25 WHEREAS, the Colorado Serum Company located in Denver, Colorado, is the only producer of the
26 Brucella abortus vaccine, strain RB-51, in the United States; and
27 WHEREAS, there is a shortage of availability of the brucellosis vaccine due to reported production
28 problems coupled with shipping delays from the Colorado plant. In February 2025, North Dakota issued a

69th Legislature 2025 SJ 27.1
1 temporary waiver of rule allowing the age of brucellosis vaccination to be extended from 12 months to 14
2 months for heifers due to the shortage of available vaccines.

4 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
5 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
6 That the 69th Legislature of the State of Montana urges the United States Congress to take meaningful
7 action to increase the production and distribution of brucellosis vaccinations for livestock by enacting legislation
8 that:
9 (1) expands the availability of brucellosis vaccinations for livestock;
10 (2) requires assistance to be provided to states for rapid response to any brucellosis outbreak; and
11 (3) provides funding opportunities, such as grant programs, to states for preventative brucellosis
12 vaccinations in livestock.
13 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State send a copy of this resolution to the
14 President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the United
15 States Department of Agriculture, the United States Department of the Interior, the United States Bureau of
16 Land Management, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, each member of the Montana Congressional
17 Delegation, and each federally recognized tribal government in Montana.
