8 WHEREAS, brucellosis, also known as "Contagious Abortion" or "Bang's Disease," is the most
9 common zoonotic disease, described by the United States Department of Agriculture as "a contagious,
10 infectious, and communicable disease, primarily affecting cattle, bison, and swine, and is caused by bacteria of
11 the genus Brucella;" and
12 WHEREAS, brucellosis is known to cause stillbirth, loss of young, reduced milk production, and
13 infertility in livestock; and
14 WHEREAS, there are no successful, affordable treatments for brucellosis in livestock, meaning that
15 vaccination is the only available method of control or prevention of brucellosis; and
16 WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature maintains that it is in the best interest of all Montanans to have
17 protection from the highly infectious Brucellosis disease; and
18 WHEREAS, the Montana Department of Livestock requires that all sexually intact female cattle or
19 domestic bison 12 months of age or older in Beaverhead, Big Horn, Broadwater, Carbon, Gallatin, Jefferson,
20 Madison, Park, Stillwater, and Sweet Grass counties must be vaccinated against brucellosis. These vaccination
21 requirements apply to resident cattle in the listed Montana counties, as well as cattle seasonally grazing in the
22 counties. Other department rule requires brucellosis testing when leaving the Designated Surveillance Area,
23 summer grazing in the Designated Surveillance Area, or changing ownership; and
24 WHEREAS, the Colorado Serum Company located in Denver, Colorado, is the only producer of the
25 Brucella abortus vaccine, strain RB-51, in the United States; and
26 WHEREAS, there is a shortage of availability of the brucellosis vaccine due to reported production
27 problems coupled with shipping delays from the Colorado plant. In February 2025, North Dakota issued a
28 temporary waiver of rule allowing the age of brucellosis vaccination to be extended from 12 months to 14

4 THE STATE OF MONTANA:
5 That the 69th Legislature of the State of Montana urges the United States Congress to take meaningful

7 that:
8 (1) expands the availability of brucellosis vaccinations for livestock;
9 (2) requires assistance to be provided to states for rapid response to any brucellosis outbreak; and
10 (3) provides funding opportunities, such as grant programs, to states for preventative brucellosis
11 vaccinations in livestock.
12 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Secretary of State send a copy of this resolution to the
13 President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the United
