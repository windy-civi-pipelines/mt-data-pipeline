Section 1:
69th Legislature - 2025 SJ 6
MONTANA RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSENT TO AND APPROVAL OF THE LONG-
RANGE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH CAPITOL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
WHEREAS, for decades the Montana Capitol building has suffered from overcrowding and constrained
public access to the legislative process, with the past 20 years seeing exponentially increasing demands on the
People's House; and
WHEREAS, with overwhelming support during the 2023 legislative session, the Montana Legislature
passed and approved House Bill 856 that defined and allocated current space for the Legislature and the
people of Montana in the Capitol and within the Capitol complex; and
WHEREAS, HB 856 also directed the Legislative Council, with consultation by the Legislative Finance
Committee and the Legislative Audit Committee, to develop an updated Long-Range Legislative Branch Capitol
Development Plan to determine and illustrate current and future Legislative Branch space needs; and
WHEREAS, the purpose of the long-range plan is to offer nonbinding options and recommendations for
the Legislature to provide space needed for the legislative process to work effectively; and
WHEREAS, the long-range plan identified that the functional capacity of the historic Capitol building
has been exceeded and that the existing space configuration is interfering with optimal effectiveness of the
legislative process; and
WHEREAS, the findings in the long-range plan concluded that additional space is needed and
identified the following space needs in order of priority: hearing rooms to accommodate debate and public
involvement in the legislative process, workspace for elected officials to facilitate legislation and improved
public access, workspace for professional support staff, and workspace for temporary staff needed during the
legislative session; and

ENROLLED BILL
69th Legislature - 2025 SJ 6
WHEREAS, the long-range plan offers the Legislature a planning and feasibility template to guide the
Legislature's long-range capital development decisions; and
WHEREAS, while the long-range plan recommendations indicate that additional space beyond what is
currently allocated to the Legislature would be necessary to achieve the optimal space needs, additional study
and legislative input will be needed to determine the most appropriate implementation plan going forward.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE STATE OF MONTANA:
(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), that the 69th Montana Legislature consents to and
approves the Long-Range Legislative Branch Capitol Development Plan as recommended by the Legislative
Council.
(2) That the 69th Montana Legislature does not consent to or approve any future option as

accommodate additional space needs of the Legislature.
