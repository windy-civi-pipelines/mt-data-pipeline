15 protective services. In implementing the policy of this section, the child's health and safety are of paramount
16 concern.
17 (b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific
18 authority requested and must be supported by an affidavit signed by a representative of the department stating
19 in detail the alleged facts upon which the request is based and the facts establishing probable cause or, if the
20 case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act provided for in
21 Title 41, chapter 3, part 13, clear and convincing evidence that a child is abused or neglected or is in danger of
22 being abused or neglected.
23 (c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
24 (i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and

7 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act,
8 clear and convincing evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being
9 abused and neglected, the judge shall grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by
10 subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the

69th Legislature 2025 LC 0729
1 consider the parents' statements, if any, included with the petition and any accompanying affidavit or report to
2 the court. If the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the
3 Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court may issue an order granting the
4 following forms of relief, which do not constitute a court-ordered treatment plan under 41-3-443 :
5 (a) the right of entry by a peace officer or department worker;
6 (b) the right to place the child in temporary medical or out-of-home care, including but not limited to
7 care provided by a noncustodial parent, kinship or foster family, group home, or institution;

9 members who may be considered as placement options for the child;

11 furnish information that the court may designate and obtain evaluations that may be necessary to determine
12 whether a child is a youth in need of care;
13 (e) a requirement that the perpetrator of the alleged child abuse or neglect be removed from the
14 home to allow the child to remain in the home;
15 (f) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the name and address of the other
16 parent, if known, unless parental rights to the child have been terminated;
17 (g) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the names and addresses of
18 extended family members who may be considered as placement options for the child who is the subject of the
19 proceeding; and
20 (h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
21 not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
22 expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
23 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
24 (3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
25 provide the court with information on:
26 (a) whether a kinship placement is available; or
27 (b) if a family foster home has been identified:

3 (iv) the proximity of the foster home to the child's home and school;
4 (v) whether the child will be able to observe religious or cultural practices important to the child;
5 and
6 (vi) whether the foster home is able to accommodate any special needs the child may have.
7 (4) In making a removal determination, the court shall weigh and evaluate, in the factual setting,
8 the harm to the child that will result from removal and determine if allowing the child to remain in the home
9 substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
10 but are not limited to:
11 (a) the factors identified in subsections (1)(c)(ii)(A) through (1)(c)(ii)(D); and
12 (b) whether the department made reasonable efforts, as described in subsection (1)(c)(ii)(E), to
13 keep the family intact.
14 (5) (a) An order for removal of a child from the home must include a finding that:
15 (i) continued residence of the child with the parent is contrary to the welfare of the child;
16 (ii) an out-of-home placement is in the best interests of the child; and
17 (iii) the risk of allowing the child to remain in the home substantially outweighs the harm of removal.
18 (b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
19 the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
20 (6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply
21 immediately with the terms of the order and to appear before the court issuing the order on the date specified
22 for a show cause hearing. Upon a failure to comply or show cause, the court may hold the person in contempt
23 or place temporary physical custody of the child with the department until further order.
24 (7) The petition must be served as provided in 41-3-422 or, if the case involves an Indian child, as
25 provided in 41-3-1311. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch. 716, L. 2023.)
26 41-3-427. (Effective July 1, 2025) Petition for immediate protection and emergency protective
27 services -- evidence and consideration of harm of removal -- order -- service. (1) (a) In a case in which it
28 appears that a child is abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected, the county attorney,
- 14 - LC 729
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 0729
1 the attorney general, or an attorney hired by the county may file a petition for immediate protection and
2 emergency protective services. In implementing the policy of this section, the child's health and safety are of
3 paramount concern.
4 (b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific
5 authority requested and must be supported by an affidavit signed by a representative of the department stating
6 in detail the alleged facts upon which the request is based and the facts establishing probable cause or, if the
7 case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence that a child is abused or
8 neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected.
9 (c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
10 (i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and
11 (ii) specific, written documentation as to why the risk of allowing the child to remain at home
12 substantially outweighs the harm of removing the child, including consideration of:
13 (A) the emotional trauma the child is likely to experience if separated from the family;
14 (B) the child's relationships with other members of the household, including siblings;
15 (C) the child's schooling and social relationships that could be disrupted with a placement out of
16 the neighborhood;
17 (D) the impact the removal would have on services the child is receiving and on extracurricular
18 activities that benefit the child; and
19 (E) documentation of reasonable efforts made to keep the family intact.
20 (d) If from the alleged facts presented in the affidavit it appears to the court that there is probable
21 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to believe
22 that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused and neglected, the judge shall
23 grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or
24 the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is
25 insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing
26 evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected,
27 the court shall dismiss the petition.
28 (e) If the parents, parent, guardian, person having physical or legal custody of the child, or attorney
- 15 - LC 729
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 0729
1 for the child disputes the material issues of fact contained in the affidavit or the veracity of the affidavit, the
2 person may request a contested show cause hearing pursuant to 41-3-432 within 10 days following service of
3 the petition and affidavit.
4 (f) The petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must include a notice
5 advising the parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child that the
6 parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child may have a support
7 person present during any meeting with a child protection specialist concerning emergency protective services.
8 Reasonable accommodation must be made in scheduling an in-person meeting with the child protection
9 specialist.
10 (g) An order for immediate protection and emergency protective services may not be issued for a
11 period longer than 90 days.
12 (2) Pursuant to subsection (1), if the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
13 federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence based on the petition and affidavit, the court
14 may issue an order for immediate protection of the child. The court shall consider the parents' statements, if
15 any, included with the petition and any accompanying affidavit or report to the court. If the court finds probable
16 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court
17 may issue an order granting the following forms of relief, which do not constitute a court-ordered treatment plan
18 under 41-3-443:
19 (a) the right of entry by a peace officer or department worker;
20 (b) the right to place the child in temporary medical or out-of-home care, including but not limited to

23 members who may be considered as placement options for the child;

25 furnish information that the court may designate and obtain evaluations that may be necessary to determine
26 whether a child is a youth in need of care;

5 proceeding; and
6 (h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
7 not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
8 expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
9 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
10 (3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
11 provide the court with information on:
12 (a) whether a kinship placement is available; or

18 (v) whether the child will be able to observe religious or cultural practices important to the child;

21 (4) In making a removal determination, the court shall weigh and evaluate, in the factual setting,
22 the harm to the child that will result from removal and determine if allowing the child to remain in the home
23 substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
24 but are not limited to:
25 (a) the factors identified in subsections (1)(c)(ii)(A) through (1)(c)(ii)(D); and
26 (b) whether the department made reasonable efforts, as described in subsection (1)(c)(ii)(E), to

3 (iii) the risk of allowing the child to remain in the home substantially outweighs the harm of removal.
4 (b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
5 the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
6 (6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply
7 immediately with the terms of the order and to appear before the court issuing the order on the date specified
8 for a show cause hearing. Upon a failure to comply or show cause, the court may hold the person in contempt

18 extended family members who may be considered as placement options for the child who is the subject of the
19 proceeding; and
20 (h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
21 not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
22 expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
23 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
24 (3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
25 provide the court with information on:

7 (4) In making a removal determination, the court shall weigh and evaluate, in the factual setting,

9 substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
10 but are not limited to:
11 (a) the factors identified in subsections (1)(c)(ii)(A) through (1)(c)(ii)(D); and
12 (b) whether the department made reasonable efforts, as described in subsection (1)(c)(ii)(E), to
13 keep the family intact.
14 (5) (a) An order for removal of a child from the home must include a finding that:
15 (i) continued residence of the child with the parent is contrary to the welfare of the child;
16 (ii) an out-of-home placement is in the best interests of the child; and
17 (iii) the risk of allowing the child to remain in the home substantially outweighs the harm of removal.
18 (b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
19 the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
20 (6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply
21 immediately with the terms of the order and to appear before the court issuing the order on the date specified
22 for a show cause hearing. Upon a failure to comply or show cause, the court may hold the person in contempt

- 14 - LC 729

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 0729
1 the attorney general, or an attorney hired by the county may file a petition for immediate protection and
2 emergency protective services. In implementing the policy of this section, the child's health and safety are of
3 paramount concern.
4 (b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific
5 authority requested and must be supported by an affidavit signed by a representative of the department stating
6 in detail the alleged facts upon which the request is based and the facts establishing probable cause or, if the
7 case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence that a child is abused or
8 neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected.
9 (c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
10 (i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and
11 (ii) specific, written documentation as to why the risk of allowing the child to remain at home
12 substantially outweighs the harm of removing the child, including consideration of:
13 (A) the emotional trauma the child is likely to experience if separated from the family;
14 (B) the child's relationships with other members of the household, including siblings;
15 (C) the child's schooling and social relationships that could be disrupted with a placement out of
16 the neighborhood;
17 (D) the impact the removal would have on services the child is receiving and on extracurricular
18 activities that benefit the child; and
19 (E) documentation of reasonable efforts made to keep the family intact.
20 (d) If from the alleged facts presented in the affidavit it appears to the court that there is probable
21 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to believe
22 that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused and neglected, the judge shall
23 grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or
24 the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is
25 insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing
26 evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected,
27 the court shall dismiss the petition.
28 (e) If the parents, parent, guardian, person having physical or legal custody of the child, or attorney
- 15 - LC 729

9 specialist.
10 (g) An order for immediate protection and emergency protective services may not be issued for a
11 period longer than 90 days.
12 (2) Pursuant to subsection (1), if the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
13 federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence based on the petition and affidavit, the court
14 may issue an order for immediate protection of the child. The court shall consider the parents' statements, if
15 any, included with the petition and any accompanying affidavit or report to the court. If the court finds probable
16 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court
17 may issue an order granting the following forms of relief, which do not constitute a court-ordered treatment plan
18 under 41-3-443:
19 (a) the right of entry by a peace officer or department worker;
20 (b) the right to place the child in temporary medical or out-of-home care, including but not limited to
21 care provided by a noncustodial parent, kinship or foster family, group home, or institution;

23 members who may be considered as placement options for the child;

6 (h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
7 not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
8 expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
9 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
10 (3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
11 provide the court with information on:

23 substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
24 but are not limited to:

4 (b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
5 the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
