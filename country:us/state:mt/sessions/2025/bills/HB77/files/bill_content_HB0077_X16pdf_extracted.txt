a child is abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected, the county attorney, the attorney
general, or an attorney hired by the county may file a petition for immediate protection and emergency
protective services. In implementing the policy of this section, the child's health and safety are of paramount
concern.
(b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific
authority requested and must be supported by an affidavit signed by a representative of the department stating
in detail the alleged facts upon which the request is based and the facts establishing probable cause or, if the
case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act provided for in
Title 41, chapter 3, part 13, clear and convincing evidence that a child is abused or neglected or is in danger of
being abused or neglected.
(c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
(i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and
(ii) specific, written documentation as to why the risk of allowing the child to remain at home
substantially outweighs the harm of removing the child, including consideration of:
(A) the emotional trauma the child is likely to experience if separated from the family;
(B) the child's relationships with other members of the household, including siblings;
- 11 - Authorized Print Version – HB 77
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 77
(C) the child's schooling and social relationships that could be disrupted with a placement out of
the neighborhood;
(D) the impact the removal would have on services the child is receiving and on extracurricular
activities that benefit the child; and
(E) documentation of reasonable efforts made to keep the family intact.
(d) If from the alleged facts presented in the affidavit it appears to the court that there is probable
cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act,
clear and convincing evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being
abused and neglected, the judge shall grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by
subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the
alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to
believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected, the court
shall dismiss the petition.
(e) If the parents, parent, guardian, person having physical or legal custody of the child, or attorney
for the child disputes the material issues of fact contained in the affidavit or the veracity of the affidavit, the
person may request a contested show cause hearing pursuant to 41-3-432 within 10 days following service of
the petition and affidavit.
(f) The petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must include a notice
advising the parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child that the
parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child may have a support
person present during any meeting with a child protection specialist concerning emergency protective services.
Reasonable accommodation must be made in scheduling an in-person meeting with the child protection
specialist.
(2) Pursuant to subsection (1), if the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence based
on the petition and affidavit, the court may issue an order for immediate protection of the child. The court shall
consider the parents' statements, if any, included with the petition and any accompanying affidavit or report to
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – HB 77
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 77
the court. If the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act or the
Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court may issue an order granting the
following forms of relief, which do not constitute a court-ordered treatment plan under 41-3-443 :
(a) the right of entry by a peace officer or department worker;
(b) the right to place the child in temporary medical or out-of-home care, including but not limited to
care provided by a noncustodial parent, kinship or foster family, group home, or institution;
(c) the right of the department to locate, contact, and share information with any extended family
members who may be considered as placement options for the child;
(d) a requirement that the parents, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody
furnish information that the court may designate and obtain evaluations that may be necessary to determine
whether a child is a youth in need of care;
(e) a requirement that the perpetrator of the alleged child abuse or neglect be removed from the
home to allow the child to remain in the home;
(f) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the name and address of the other
parent, if known, unless parental rights to the child have been terminated;
(g) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the names and addresses of
extended family members who may be considered as placement options for the child who is the subject of the
proceeding; and
(h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
(3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
provide the court with information on:
(a) whether a kinship placement is available; or
(b) if a family foster home has been identified:
(i) where the foster home is located in relation to the child's home;
(ii) whether the foster placement can accommodate the proposed visitation schedule;
- 13 - Authorized Print Version – HB 77
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 77
(iii) whether siblings can be placed together;
(iv) the proximity of the foster home to the child's home and school;
(v) whether the child will be able to observe religious or cultural practices important to the child;
and
(vi) whether the foster home is able to accommodate any special needs the child may have.
(4) In making a removal determination, the court shall weigh and evaluate, in the factual setting,
the harm to the child that will result from removal and determine if allowing the child to remain in the home
substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
but are not limited to:

(b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
(6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply

41-3-427. (Effective July 1, 2025) Petition for immediate protection and emergency protective
services -- evidence and consideration of harm of removal -- order -- service. (1) (a) In a case in which it

the attorney general, or an attorney hired by the county may file a petition for immediate protection and
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 77

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 77
emergency protective services. In implementing the policy of this section, the child's health and safety are of
paramount concern.
(b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific
authority requested and must be supported by an affidavit signed by a representative of the department stating
in detail the alleged facts upon which the request is based and the facts establishing probable cause or, if the
case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence that a child is abused or
neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected.
(c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
(i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and
(ii) specific, written documentation as to why the risk of allowing the child to remain at home
substantially outweighs the harm of removing the child, including consideration of:
(A) the emotional trauma the child is likely to experience if separated from the family;
(B) the child's relationships with other members of the household, including siblings;
(C) the child's schooling and social relationships that could be disrupted with a placement out of
the neighborhood;
(D) the impact the removal would have on services the child is receiving and on extracurricular
activities that benefit the child; and
(E) documentation of reasonable efforts made to keep the family intact.
(d) If from the alleged facts presented in the affidavit it appears to the court that there is probable
cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to believe
that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused and neglected, the judge shall
grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or
the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is
insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing
evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected,
the court shall dismiss the petition.
(e) If the parents, parent, guardian, person having physical or legal custody of the child, or attorney
for the child disputes the material issues of fact contained in the affidavit or the veracity of the affidavit, the
- 15 - Authorized Print Version – HB 77
ENROLLED BILL
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 77
person may request a contested show cause hearing pursuant to 41-3-432 within 10 days following service of
the petition and affidavit.
(f) The petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must include a notice
advising the parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child that the
parents, parent, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody of the child may have a support
person present during any meeting with a child protection specialist concerning emergency protective services.
Reasonable accommodation must be made in scheduling an in-person meeting with the child protection
specialist.
(g) An order for immediate protection and emergency protective services may not be issued for a
period longer than 90 days.
(2) Pursuant to subsection (1), if the court finds probable cause or, if the case is subject to the
federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence based on the petition and affidavit, the court
may issue an order for immediate protection of the child. The court shall consider the parents' statements, if
any, included with the petition and any accompanying affidavit or report to the court. If the court finds probable
cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court
may issue an order granting the following forms of relief, which do not constitute a court-ordered treatment plan
under 41-3-443:
(a) the right of entry by a peace officer or department worker;
(b) the right to place the child in temporary medical or out-of-home care, including but not limited to
care provided by a noncustodial parent, kinship or foster family, group home, or institution;
(c) the right of the department to locate, contact, and share information with any extended family
members who may be considered as placement options for the child;
(d) a requirement that the parents, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody
furnish information that the court may designate and obtain evaluations that may be necessary to determine
whether a child is a youth in need of care;
(e) a requirement that the perpetrator of the alleged child abuse or neglect be removed from the
home to allow the child to remain in the home;
(f) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the name and address of the other
- 16 - Authorized Print Version – HB 77

(g) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the names and addresses of
extended family members who may be considered as placement options for the child who is the subject of the
proceeding; and
(h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
(3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
provide the court with information on:
(a) whether a kinship placement is available; or
(b) if a family foster home has been identified:
(i) where the foster home is located in relation to the child's home;
(ii) whether the foster placement can accommodate the proposed visitation schedule;
(iii) whether siblings can be placed together;
(iv) the proximity of the foster home to the child's home and school;
(v) whether the child will be able to observe religious or cultural practices important to the child;
and
(vi) whether the foster home is able to accommodate any special needs the child may have.
(4) In making a removal determination, the court shall weigh and evaluate, in the factual setting,
the harm to the child that will result from removal and determine if allowing the child to remain in the home
substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
but are not limited to:
(a) the factors identified in subsections (1)(c)(ii)(A) through (1)(c)(ii)(D); and
(b) whether the department made reasonable efforts, as described in subsection (1)(c)(ii)(E), to
keep the family intact.

(ii) an out-of-home placement is in the best interests of the child; and
(iii) the risk of allowing the child to remain in the home substantially outweighs the harm of removal.
(b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
(6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply
immediately with the terms of the order and to appear before the court issuing the order on the date specified
for a show cause hearing. Upon a failure to comply or show cause, the court may hold the person in contempt
or place temporary physical custody of the child with the department until further order.

the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
