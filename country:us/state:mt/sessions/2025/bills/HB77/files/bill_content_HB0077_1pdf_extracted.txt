15 protective services. In implementing the policy of this section, the child's health and safety are of paramount
16 concern.
17 (b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific
18 authority requested and must be supported by an affidavit signed by a representative of the department stating
19 in detail the alleged facts upon which the request is based and the facts establishing probable cause or, if the

22 being abused or neglected.
23 (c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
24 (i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and

8 clear and convincing evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being
9 abused and neglected, the judge shall grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by

2 Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court may issue an order granting the
3 following forms of relief, which do not constitute a court-ordered treatment plan under 41-3-443 :
4 (a) the right of entry by a peace officer or department worker;
5 (b) the right to place the child in temporary medical or out-of-home care, including but not limited to
6 care provided by a noncustodial parent, kinship or foster family, group home, or institution;

8 members who may be considered as placement options for the child;

14 (f) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the name and address of the other
15 parent, if known, unless parental rights to the child have been terminated;
16 (g) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the names and addresses of
17 extended family members who may be considered as placement options for the child who is the subject of the
18 proceeding; and
19 (h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
20 not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
21 expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
22 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
23 (3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
24 provide the court with information on:
25 (a) whether a kinship placement is available; or
26 (b) if a family foster home has been identified:

5 (vi) whether the foster home is able to accommodate any special needs the child may have.
6 (4) In making a removal determination, the court shall weigh and evaluate, in the factual setting,
7 the harm to the child that will result from removal and determine if allowing the child to remain in the home
8 substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
9 but are not limited to:
10 (a) the factors identified in subsections (1)(c)(ii)(A) through (1)(c)(ii)(D); and
11 (b) whether the department made reasonable efforts, as described in subsection (1)(c)(ii)(E), to
12 keep the family intact.
13 (5) (a) An order for removal of a child from the home must include a finding that:
14 (i) continued residence of the child with the parent is contrary to the welfare of the child;
15 (ii) an out-of-home placement is in the best interests of the child; and
16 (iii) the risk of allowing the child to remain in the home substantially outweighs the harm of removal.
17 (b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
18 the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
19 (6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply
20 immediately with the terms of the order and to appear before the court issuing the order on the date specified
21 for a show cause hearing. Upon a failure to comply or show cause, the court may hold the person in contempt
22 or place temporary physical custody of the child with the department until further order.
23 (7) The petition must be served as provided in 41-3-422 or, if the case involves an Indian child, as
24 provided in 41-3-1311. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch. 716, L. 2023.)

28 the attorney general, or an attorney hired by the county may file a petition for immediate protection and
- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 77
****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 77.1
1 emergency protective services. In implementing the policy of this section, the child's health and safety are of
2 paramount concern.
3 (b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific
4 authority requested and must be supported by an affidavit signed by a representative of the department stating
5 in detail the alleged facts upon which the request is based and the facts establishing probable cause or, if the
6 case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence that a child is abused or
7 neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected.
8 (c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
9 (i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and
10 (ii) specific, written documentation as to why the risk of allowing the child to remain at home
11 substantially outweighs the harm of removing the child, including consideration of:
12 (A) the emotional trauma the child is likely to experience if separated from the family;
13 (B) the child's relationships with other members of the household, including siblings;
14 (C) the child's schooling and social relationships that could be disrupted with a placement out of
15 the neighborhood;
16 (D) the impact the removal would have on services the child is receiving and on extracurricular
17 activities that benefit the child; and
18 (E) documentation of reasonable efforts made to keep the family intact.
19 (d) If from the alleged facts presented in the affidavit it appears to the court that there is probable
20 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to believe
21 that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused and neglected, the judge shall
22 grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or
23 the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is
24 insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing
25 evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected,
26 the court shall dismiss the petition.
27 (e) If the parents, parent, guardian, person having physical or legal custody of the child, or attorney
28 for the child disputes the material issues of fact contained in the affidavit or the veracity of the affidavit, the

12 federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence based on the petition and affidavit, the court
13 may issue an order for immediate protection of the child. The court shall consider the parents' statements, if
14 any, included with the petition and any accompanying affidavit or report to the court. If the court finds probable
15 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court

2 Montana Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court may issue an order granting the
3 following forms of relief, which do not constitute a court-ordered treatment plan under 41-3-443 :
4 (a) the right of entry by a peace officer or department worker;
5 (b) the right to place the child in temporary medical or out-of-home care, including but not limited to
6 care provided by a noncustodial parent, kinship or foster family, group home, or institution;
7 (c) the right of the department to locate, contact, and share information with any extended family
8 members who may be considered as placement options for the child;
9 (d) a requirement that the parents, guardian, or other person having physical or legal custody
10 furnish information that the court may designate and obtain evaluations that may be necessary to determine
11 whether a child is a youth in need of care;
12 (e) a requirement that the perpetrator of the alleged child abuse or neglect be removed from the
13 home to allow the child to remain in the home;
14 (f) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the name and address of the other
15 parent, if known, unless parental rights to the child have been terminated;
16 (g) a requirement that the parent provide the department with the names and addresses of
17 extended family members who may be considered as placement options for the child who is the subject of the
18 proceeding; and
19 (h) any other temporary disposition that may be required in the best interests of the child that does
20 not require an expenditure of money by the department unless the court finds after notice and a hearing that the
21 expenditure is reasonable and that resources are available for payment. The department is the payor of last
22 resort after all family, insurance, and other resources have been examined.
23 (3) When requesting emergency protective services under this section, the department shall
24 provide the court with information on:
25 (a) whether a kinship placement is available; or
26 (b) if a family foster home has been identified:

3 (v) whether the child will be able to observe religious or cultural practices important to the child;
4 and
5 (vi) whether the foster home is able to accommodate any special needs the child may have.
6 (4) In making a removal determination, the court shall weigh and evaluate, in the factual setting,
7 the harm to the child that will result from removal and determine if allowing the child to remain in the home
8 substantially outweighs the harm of removal. Factors for consideration of the best interests of the child include
9 but are not limited to:
10 (a) the factors identified in subsections (1)(c)(ii)(A) through (1)(c)(ii)(D); and
11 (b) whether the department made reasonable efforts, as described in subsection (1)(c)(ii)(E), to
12 keep the family intact.
13 (5) (a) An order for removal of a child from the home must include a finding that:
14 (i) continued residence of the child with the parent is contrary to the welfare of the child;
15 (ii) an out-of-home placement is in the best interests of the child; and
16 (iii) the risk of allowing the child to remain in the home substantially outweighs the harm of removal.
17 (b) The court shall provide written findings to explain why the risk of the child's continued stay in
18 the home outweighs the harm of removing the child.
19 (6) The order for immediate protection of the child must require the person served to comply
20 immediately with the terms of the order and to appear before the court issuing the order on the date specified
21 for a show cause hearing. Upon a failure to comply or show cause, the court may hold the person in contempt
22 or place temporary physical custody of the child with the department until further order.
23 (7) The petition must be served as provided in 41-3-422 or, if the case involves an Indian child, as
24 provided in 41-3-1311. (Terminates June 30, 2025--sec. 55, Ch. 716, L. 2023.)

26 services -- evidence and consideration of harm of removal -- order -- service. (1) (a) In a case in which it
27 appears that a child is abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected, the county attorney,
28 the attorney general, or an attorney hired by the county may file a petition for immediate protection and

69th Legislature 2025 HB 77.1
1 emergency protective services. In implementing the policy of this section, the child's health and safety are of
2 paramount concern.
3 (b) A petition for immediate protection and emergency protective services must state the specific
4 authority requested and must be supported by an affidavit signed by a representative of the department stating
5 in detail the alleged facts upon which the request is based and the facts establishing probable cause or, if the
6 case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence that a child is abused or
7 neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected.
8 (c) The affidavit of the department representative must contain:
9 (i) information, if any, regarding statements made by the parents about the facts of the case; and
10 (ii) specific, written documentation as to why the risk of allowing the child to remain at home
11 substantially outweighs the harm of removing the child, including consideration of:
12 (A) the emotional trauma the child is likely to experience if separated from the family;
13 (B) the child's relationships with other members of the household, including siblings;
14 (C) the child's schooling and social relationships that could be disrupted with a placement out of
15 the neighborhood;
16 (D) the impact the removal would have on services the child is receiving and on extracurricular
17 activities that benefit the child; and
18 (E) documentation of reasonable efforts made to keep the family intact.
19 (d) If from the alleged facts presented in the affidavit it appears to the court that there is probable
20 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence to believe
21 that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused and neglected, the judge shall
22 grant emergency protective services and the relief authorized by subsection (2) until the adjudication hearing or
23 the temporary investigative hearing. If it appears from the alleged facts contained in the affidavit that there is
24 insufficient probable cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing
25 evidence to believe that the child has been abused or neglected or is in danger of being abused or neglected,
26 the court shall dismiss the petition.
27 (e) If the parents, parent, guardian, person having physical or legal custody of the child, or attorney
28 for the child disputes the material issues of fact contained in the affidavit or the veracity of the affidavit, the

12 federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence based on the petition and affidavit, the court
13 may issue an order for immediate protection of the child. The court shall consider the parents' statements, if
14 any, included with the petition and any accompanying affidavit or report to the court. If the court finds probable
15 cause or, if the case is subject to the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, clear and convincing evidence, the court
