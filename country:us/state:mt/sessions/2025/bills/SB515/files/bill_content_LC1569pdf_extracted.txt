- 7 - LC 1569
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1569
1 (1) Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the commission, may be construed to
2 limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other
3 rules related to the practice of cosmetology in that state, where those laws, regulations, or other rules are not
4 inconsistent with the provisions of this compact.
5 (2) Insofar as practical, a member state's state licensing authority shall cooperate with the
6 commission and with each entity exercising independent regulatory authority over the practice of cosmetology
7 according to the provisions of this compact.
8 (3) Discipline must be the sole responsibility of the state in which cosmetology services are
9 provided. Accordingly, each member state's state licensing authority must be responsible for receiving
10 complaints about individuals practicing cosmetology in that state, and for communicating all relevant
11 investigative information about any such adverse action to the other member states through the data system in
12 addition to any other methods the commission may by rule require.
13 ARTICLE 7

15 (1) A licensee's home state has exclusive power to impose an adverse action against a licensee's
16 multistate license issued by the home state.
17 (2) A home state may take adverse action on a multistate license based on the investigative
18 information, current significant investigative information, or adverse action of a remote state.
19 (3) In addition to the powers conferred by state law, each remote state's state licensing authority
20 has the power to:
21 (a) take adverse action against a licensee's authorization to practice cosmetology through the
22 multistate license in that member state, provided that:
23 (i) only the licensee's home state may have the power to take adverse action against the
24 multistate license issued by the home state; and
25 (ii) for the purposes of taking adverse action, the home state's state licensing authority shall give
26 the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if the conduct had
27 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine the
28 appropriate action.
- 8 - LC 1569

1 (b) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a licensee's authorization to

7 testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a state licensing authority
8 in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another
9 member state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
10 practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings before it. The issuing state
11 licensing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service
12 statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
13 (e) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected licensee the costs of
14 investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee;
15 (f) take adverse action against the licensee's authorization to practice in that state based on the
16 factual findings of another remote state.
17 (4) A licensee's home state shall complete any pending investigation of a cosmetologist who
18 changes their primary state of residence during the course of the investigation. The home state also has the
19 authority to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the data
20 system.
21 (5) If an adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's multistate license, the
22 licensee's authorization to practice in all other member states must be deactivated until all encumbrances have
23 been removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose an adverse action
24 against a licensee's multistate license must include a statement that the cosmetologist's authorization to
25 practice is deactivated in all member states during the pendency of the order.
26 (6) Nothing in this compact may override a member state's authority to accept a licensee's
27 participation in an alternative program in lieu of adverse action. A licensee's multistate license must be
28 suspended for the duration of the licensee's participation in any alternative program.

24 reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities,
25 provided that nothing herein may be construed to prohibit that person from retaining their own counsel at their
26 own expense, and provided further that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that

5 alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
6 (d) Nothing herein may be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for professional
7 malpractice or misconduct, which must be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.

19 RULEMAKING
20 (1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
21 implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule must be invalid and have no
22 force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission
23 exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the
24 powers granted hereunder, or based on another applicable standard of review.
25 (2) The rules of the commission have the force of law in each member state, provided however
26 that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the member state that establish the member
27 state's scope of practice laws governing the practice of cosmetology as held by a court of competent
28 jurisdiction, the rules of the commission are ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.

4 (4) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by
5 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within 4 years of the date of
6 adoption of the rule, then the rule has no further force and effect in any member state or to any state applying to
7 participate in the compact.
8 (5) Rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
9 (6) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow
10 persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
11 (7) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, and at least 30 days in advance of the

13 a notice of proposed rulemaking:
14 (a) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;

69th Legislature 2025 LC 1569
1 (10) Nothing in this article may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules
2 may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this article.
3 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule
4 based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
5 (a) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule, provided the changes do not
6 enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.

8 the proposed rule as well as the reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
9 commenters.
10 (c) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
11 emergency as provided in article 11(12), the effective date of the rule must be no sooner than 45 days after the
12 commission issues the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
13 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
14 emergency rule with 5 days' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking
15 procedures provided in the compact and in this article are retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
16 reasonably possible, and in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of

3 ARTICLE 12
4 OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
5 (1) Oversight:
6 (a) The executive and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce
7 this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
8 (b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission must be brought solely
9 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
10 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
11 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein may affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue
12 in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
13 (c) The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
14 enforcement or interpretation of the compact and has standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
15 purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process renders a judgment or order void as to the
16 commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.
17 (2) Default, technical assistance, and termination:

19 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written

22 assistance regarding the default.
23 (b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
24 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
25 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
26 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
27 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
28 default.
- 21 - LC 1569
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1569
1 (d) Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of

4 state's state licensing authority, and each of the member states' state licensing authority.

21 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
22 resolution for disputes as appropriate.
23 (4) Enforcement:
24 (a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this
25 compact and the commission's rules.
26 (b) By majority vote as provided by commission rule, the commission may initiate legal action

28 district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact
- 22 - LC 1569
****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1569
1 and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
2 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of the litigation, including

4 commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal law or the defaulting member state's law.
5 (c) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United States district
6 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce

9 awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.

11 commission.

18 state is materially different from the model compact statute.
19 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
20 compact statute must be entitled to the default process set forth in article 12.
21 (ii) If any member state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the
22 compact, the commission must remain in existence and the compact must remain in effect even if the number
23 of member states should be less than seven.
24 (b) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter member states must be subject
25 to the process set forth in article 9(3)(x) to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model

17 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
18 conflict with the provisions of this compact.

20 become effective and binding on any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
21 ARTICLE 14
22 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
23 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed so as to
24 effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration, of the compact. Provisions of the compact
25 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's
26 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.

4 person, or circumstance may not be affected.
5 (3) Notwithstanding article 14(2), the commission may deny a state's participation in the compact
6 or, in accordance with the requirements of article 12, terminate a member state's participation in the compact, if
7 it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact.
8 Otherwise, if this compact must be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact
9 must remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the
10 member state affected as to all severable matters.

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 1569
1 (1) Nothing in this compact, nor any rule or regulation of the commission, may be construed to
2 limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other
3 rules related to the practice of cosmetology in that state, where those laws, regulations, or other rules are not
4 inconsistent with the provisions of this compact.
5 (2) Insofar as practical, a member state's state licensing authority shall cooperate with the
6 commission and with each entity exercising independent regulatory authority over the practice of cosmetology
7 according to the provisions of this compact.
8 (3) Discipline must be the sole responsibility of the state in which cosmetology services are
9 provided. Accordingly, each member state's state licensing authority must be responsible for receiving
10 complaints about individuals practicing cosmetology in that state, and for communicating all relevant
11 investigative information about any such adverse action to the other member states through the data system in
12 addition to any other methods the commission may by rule require.

17 (2) A home state may take adverse action on a multistate license based on the investigative
18 information, current significant investigative information, or adverse action of a remote state.
19 (3) In addition to the powers conferred by state law, each remote state's state licensing authority
20 has the power to:
21 (a) take adverse action against a licensee's authorization to practice cosmetology through the
22 multistate license in that member state, provided that:
23 (i) only the licensee's home state may have the power to take adverse action against the
24 multistate license issued by the home state; and
25 (ii) for the purposes of taking adverse action, the home state's state licensing authority shall give
26 the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if the conduct had
27 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine the
28 appropriate action.
- 8 - LC 1569

1 (b) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a licensee's authorization to

7 testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a state licensing authority
8 in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another
9 member state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
10 practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings before it. The issuing state
11 licensing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service
12 statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
13 (e) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected licensee the costs of
14 investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee;
15 (f) take adverse action against the licensee's authorization to practice in that state based on the
16 factual findings of another remote state.
17 (4) A licensee's home state shall complete any pending investigation of a cosmetologist who
18 changes their primary state of residence during the course of the investigation. The home state also has the
19 authority to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the data
20 system.
21 (5) If an adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's multistate license, the
22 licensee's authorization to practice in all other member states must be deactivated until all encumbrances have
23 been removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose an adverse action
24 against a licensee's multistate license must include a statement that the cosmetologist's authorization to
25 practice is deactivated in all member states during the pendency of the order.
26 (6) Nothing in this compact may override a member state's authority to accept a licensee's
27 participation in an alternative program in lieu of adverse action. A licensee's multistate license must be
28 suspended for the duration of the licensee's participation in any alternative program.

19 RULEMAKING
20 (1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
21 implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule must be invalid and have no
22 force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission

24 powers granted hereunder, or based on another applicable standard of review.
25 (2) The rules of the commission have the force of law in each member state, provided however

28 jurisdiction, the rules of the commission are ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.

7 participate in the compact.
8 (5) Rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
9 (6) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow

3 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule
4 based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.

10 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in

13 (c) The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the

25 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
26 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
27 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
28 default.

1 and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
2 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of the litigation, including

4 commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal law or the defaulting member state's law.
5 (c) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United States district
6 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce

24 (b) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter member states must be subject

22 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
23 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed so as to
24 effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration, of the compact. Provisions of the compact
25 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's
26 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.

4 person, or circumstance may not be affected.
5 (3) Notwithstanding article 14(2), the commission may deny a state's participation in the compact
6 or, in accordance with the requirements of article 12, terminate a member state's participation in the compact, if
