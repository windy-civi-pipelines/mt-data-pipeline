- 7 - Authorized Print Version – SB 515
****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 515.1
1 limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other
2 rules related to the practice of cosmetology in that state, where those laws, regulations, or other rules are not
3 inconsistent with the provisions of this compact.
4 (2) Insofar as practical, a member state's state licensing authority shall cooperate with the
5 commission and with each entity exercising independent regulatory authority over the practice of cosmetology
6 according to the provisions of this compact.
7 (3) Discipline must be the sole responsibility of the state in which cosmetology services are
8 provided. Accordingly, each member state's state licensing authority must be responsible for receiving
9 complaints about individuals practicing cosmetology in that state, and for communicating all relevant
10 investigative information about any such adverse action to the other member states through the data system in
11 addition to any other methods the commission may by rule require.
12 ARTICLE 7

14 (1) A licensee's home state has exclusive power to impose an adverse action against a licensee's
15 multistate license issued by the home state.
16 (2) A home state may take adverse action on a multistate license based on the investigative
17 information, current significant investigative information, or adverse action of a remote state.
18 (3) In addition to the powers conferred by state law, each remote state's state licensing authority
19 has the power to:
20 (a) take adverse action against a licensee's authorization to practice cosmetology through the
21 multistate license in that member state, provided that:
22 (i) only the licensee's home state may have the power to take adverse action against the
23 multistate license issued by the home state; and
24 (ii) for the purposes of taking adverse action, the home state's state licensing authority shall give
25 the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if the conduct had
26 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine the
27 appropriate action.
28 (b) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a licensee's authorization to
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – SB 515

69th Legislature 2025 SB 515.1

6 testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a state licensing authority
7 in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another
8 member state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
9 practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings before it. The issuing state
10 licensing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service
11 statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
12 (e) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected licensee the costs of
13 investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee;
14 (f) take adverse action against the licensee's authorization to practice in that state based on the
15 factual findings of another remote state.
16 (4) A licensee's home state shall complete any pending investigation of a cosmetologist who
17 changes their primary state of residence during the course of the investigation. The home state also has the
18 authority to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the data
19 system.
20 (5) If an adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's multistate license, the
21 licensee's authorization to practice in all other member states must be deactivated until all encumbrances have
22 been removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose an adverse action
23 against a licensee's multistate license must include a statement that the cosmetologist's authorization to
24 practice is deactivated in all member states during the pendency of the order.
25 (6) Nothing in this compact may override a member state's authority to accept a licensee's
26 participation in an alternative program in lieu of adverse action. A licensee's multistate license must be
27 suspended for the duration of the licensee's participation in any alternative program.

13 or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act,
14 error, or omission that occurred, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for

16 in this subsection may be construed to protect the person from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury, or

23 reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities,

4 alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
5 (d) Nothing herein may be construed as a limitation on the liability of any licensee for professional
6 malpractice or misconduct, which must be governed solely by any other applicable state laws.

18 RULEMAKING
19 (1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
20 implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule must be invalid and have no
21 force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission
22 exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or the
23 powers granted hereunder, or based on another applicable standard of review.
24 (2) The rules of the commission have the force of law in each member state, provided however
25 that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the member state that establish the member
26 state's scope of practice laws governing the practice of cosmetology as held by a court of competent
27 jurisdiction, the rules of the commission are ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict.
28 (3) The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this
- 18 - Authorized Print Version – SB 515

2 commission for each rule.
3 (4) If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by
4 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within 4 years of the date of
5 adoption of the rule, then the rule has no further force and effect in any member state or to any state applying to
6 participate in the compact.
7 (5) Rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.
8 (6) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow
9 persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.
10 (7) Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, and at least 30 days in advance of the

12 a notice of proposed rulemaking:
13 (a) on the website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform;
14 (b) to persons who have requested notice of the commission's notices of proposed rulemaking;

22 commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking;

24 (d) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and
25 (e) the manner in which interested persons may submit written comments.
26 (9) All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents
27 received by the commission in response to the proposed rule must be available to the public.
28 (10) Nothing in this article may be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules

69th Legislature 2025 SB 515.1
1 may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this article.
2 (11) The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule
3 based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.
4 (a) The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule, provided the changes do not
5 enlarge the original purpose of the proposed rule.

7 the proposed rule as well as the reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by
8 commenters.
9 (c) The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule. Except for an
10 emergency as provided in article 11(12), the effective date of the rule must be no sooner than 45 days after the
11 commission issues the notice that it adopted or amended the rule.
12 (12) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an
13 emergency rule with 5 days' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking
14 procedures provided in the compact and in this article are retroactively applied to the rule as soon as
15 reasonably possible, and in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of
16 this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately to:
17 (a) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
18 (b) prevent a loss of commission or member state funds;

24 revision must be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be
25 challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made
26 in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the
27 revision must take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect
28 without the approval of the commission.

6 this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact.
7 (b) Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission must be brought solely
8 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located. The
9 commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in

12 (c) The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
13 enforcement or interpretation of the compact and has standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all

15 commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.

18 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written

20 default, and any other action that the commission may take, and it must offer training and specific technical
21 assistance regarding the default.
22 (b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
23 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
24 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
25 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
26 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
27 default.
28 (d) Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of

18 (a) Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to
19 the compact that arise among member states and between member and nonmember states.
20 (b) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute
21 resolution for disputes as appropriate.
22 (4) Enforcement:
23 (a) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this
24 compact and the commission's rules.
25 (b) By majority vote as provided by commission rule, the commission may initiate legal action
26 against a member state in default in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal
27 district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact
28 and its promulgated rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 515.1
1 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of the litigation, including
2 reasonable attorney fees. The remedies herein may not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The
3 commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal law or the defaulting member state's law.
4 (c) A member state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United States district
5 court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce

10 commission.

17 state is materially different from the model compact statute.
18 (i) A charter member state whose enactment is found to be materially different from the model
19 compact statute must be entitled to the default process set forth in article 12.

23 (b) Member states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter member states must be subject
24 to the process set forth in article 9(3)(x) to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model

26 (c) All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the
27 administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into
28 existence are considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission.

16 agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a nonmember state that does not
17 conflict with the provisions of this compact.

19 become effective and binding on any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
20 ARTICLE 14
21 CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
22 (1) This compact and the commission's rulemaking authority must be liberally construed so as to
23 effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and administration, of the compact. Provisions of the compact
24 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules may not be construed to limit the commission's
25 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.

3 person, or circumstance may not be affected.
4 (3) Notwithstanding article 14(2), the commission may deny a state's participation in the compact
5 or, in accordance with the requirements of article 12, terminate a member state's participation in the compact, if
6 it determines that a constitutional requirement of a member state is a material departure from the compact.
7 Otherwise, if this compact must be held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact
8 must remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the
9 member state affected as to all severable matters.

****
69th Legislature 2025 SB 515.1
1 limit, restrict, or in any way reduce the ability of a member state to enact and enforce laws, regulations, or other
2 rules related to the practice of cosmetology in that state, where those laws, regulations, or other rules are not
3 inconsistent with the provisions of this compact.
4 (2) Insofar as practical, a member state's state licensing authority shall cooperate with the
5 commission and with each entity exercising independent regulatory authority over the practice of cosmetology
6 according to the provisions of this compact.
7 (3) Discipline must be the sole responsibility of the state in which cosmetology services are
8 provided. Accordingly, each member state's state licensing authority must be responsible for receiving
9 complaints about individuals practicing cosmetology in that state, and for communicating all relevant
10 investigative information about any such adverse action to the other member states through the data system in
11 addition to any other methods the commission may by rule require.
12 ARTICLE 7
13 ADVERSE ACTIONS
14 (1) A licensee's home state has exclusive power to impose an adverse action against a licensee's
15 multistate license issued by the home state.
16 (2) A home state may take adverse action on a multistate license based on the investigative
17 information, current significant investigative information, or adverse action of a remote state.
18 (3) In addition to the powers conferred by state law, each remote state's state licensing authority
19 has the power to:
20 (a) take adverse action against a licensee's authorization to practice cosmetology through the
21 multistate license in that member state, provided that:
22 (i) only the licensee's home state may have the power to take adverse action against the
23 multistate license issued by the home state; and
24 (ii) for the purposes of taking adverse action, the home state's state licensing authority shall give
25 the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a remote state as it would if the conduct had
26 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine the
27 appropriate action.
28 (b) issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a licensee's authorization to
- 8 - Authorized Print Version – SB 515

69th Legislature 2025 SB 515.1
1 practice within that member state;

4 results of the investigation to the commission through the data system as described herein.
5 (d) issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and
6 testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a state licensing authority
7 in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another
8 member state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the
9 practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings before it. The issuing state
10 licensing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service
11 statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.
12 (e) if otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected licensee the costs of
13 investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee;
14 (f) take adverse action against the licensee's authorization to practice in that state based on the
15 factual findings of another remote state.
16 (4) A licensee's home state shall complete any pending investigation of a cosmetologist who
17 changes their primary state of residence during the course of the investigation. The home state also has the
18 authority to take appropriate action and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the data
19 system.
20 (5) If an adverse action is taken by the home state against a licensee's multistate license, the
21 licensee's authorization to practice in all other member states must be deactivated until all encumbrances have
22 been removed from the home state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose an adverse action
23 against a licensee's multistate license must include a statement that the cosmetologist's authorization to
24 practice is deactivated in all member states during the pendency of the order.
25 (6) Nothing in this compact may override a member state's authority to accept a licensee's
26 participation in an alternative program in lieu of adverse action. A licensee's multistate license must be
27 suspended for the duration of the licensee's participation in any alternative program.
28 (7) Joint investigations:

5 of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the compact.
6 ARTICLE 8
7 ACTIVE MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES

10 designation during any period of service when that individual or their spouse is on active duty assignment.

13 COSMETOLOGY LICENSURE COMPACT COMMISSION

15 membership consists of all member states that have enacted the compact known as the cosmetology licensure

18 RULEMAKING
19 (1) The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently
20 implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact. A rule must be invalid and have no
21 force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission

23 powers granted hereunder, or based on another applicable standard of review.
24 (2) The rules of the commission have the force of law in each member state, provided however

5 adoption of the rule, then the rule has no further force and effect in any member state or to any state applying to
6 participate in the compact.
7 (5) Rules must be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.

12 (c) The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the

18 obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written

22 (b) The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.
23 (c) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
24 compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member states, and all rights, privileges
25 and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A
26 cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
27 default.
