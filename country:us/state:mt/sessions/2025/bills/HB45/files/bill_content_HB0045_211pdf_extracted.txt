6 within 2 years of the date of overbilling.
7 (2) This section is intended to be consistent with limitations on actions as provided in 47 U.S.C.

23 approval of a schedule, a utility may waive the time period.
24 (2) Notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, other than rate adjustments made
25 pursuant to 69-3-308, the rates, tolls, or charges set forth in any schedule filed with the commission pursuant to

1 time period. However, if the rates, tolls, or charges become effective because of the passage of 9 months, the
2 revenue collected is subject to rebate, plus interest at an annual rate determined by the commission, to the
3 extent that the rates, tolls, or charges ultimately approved by the commission in its final decision produce
4 revenue that is less than that collected under the filed schedules. In the case of an investor-owned utility, the
