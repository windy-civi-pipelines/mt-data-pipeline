in any schedule, including schedules of joint rates, except as approved by the commission, upon or on the
passage of 9 months, or by operation of 69-3-907(1). If the 9-month time period expires prior to commission
approval of a schedule, a utility may waive the time period.
(2) Notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, other than rate adjustments made
pursuant to 69-3-308, the rates, tolls, or charges set forth in any schedule filed with the commission pursuant to
69-3-301 must become effective and be lawful rates, tolls, or charges for the utility service rendered 9 months
after the date upon which the schedule was filed under the rules of practice and procedure for filing as adopted

ENROLLED BILL

time period. However, if the rates, tolls, or charges become effective because of the passage of 9 months, the
revenue collected is subject to rebate, plus interest at an annual rate determined by the commission, to the
extent that the rates, tolls, or charges ultimately approved by the commission in its final decision produce
revenue that is less than that collected under the filed schedules. In the case of an investor-owned utility, the
interest rate set by the commission may not exceed the cost of equity capital as last determined by the
commission.
(3) The commission may prescribe rules necessary to effectively administer this section."

Section 9:
Section 5. Section 69-3-305, MCA, is amended to read:
"69-3-305. Deviations from scheduled rates, tolls, and charges. (1) Except as provided in
subsection (5)(a) (4)(a), a public utility may not:
(a) charge, demand, collect, or receive a greater or less compensation for a utility service
performed by it within the state or for any service in connection with a utility service than is specified in the
printed schedules, including schedules of joint rates, that may at the time be in force;
(b) demand, collect, or receive a rate, toll, or charge not specified in the schedules; or
(c) grant a rebate, concession, or special privilege to a consumer or user that, directly or indirectly,
has or may have the effect of changing the rates, tolls, charges, or payments.

charges until the rates, tolls, and charges are changed, as provided in this chapter.
(3) The commission may order refunds or credits of rates, tolls, or charges collected in violation of
this section and may order payment of interest at a reasonable rate on the refunded amount.

(5)(4) (a) A provider of regulated telecommunications service may offer, for a limited period of time,
rebates, price reductions, or waivers of charges in conjunction with promotions, market trials, or other sales-
related activities that are common business practices. Promotional pricing for services to end users does not
require advance approval of the commission. Informational price lists must be filed with the commission on or
before the date that the promotion begins.

(b) A public utility providing electricity or natural gas may offer grants and subsidized loans to
install energy conservation and nonfossil forms of energy generation systems in dwellings.
(c) The commission may define the appropriate scope of promotions, rebates, market trials, and
grants and subsidized loans, either by rule or in response to complaints. The commission may determine
whether a particular sales activity or grant or subsidized loan program under this subsection (4) is unfairly
discriminatory or is not cost-effective. Costs and expenses incurred or revenue foregone with respect to sales
activities and grant and subsidized loan programs that the commission determines are unfairly discriminatory or
not cost-effective are the responsibility of the provider's shareholders in rates set by the commission.
(6)(5) A public utility violating the provisions of this section is subject to the penalty prescribed in 69-
3-206. However, this does not have the effect of suspending, rescinding, invalidating, or in any way affecting

Section 3. Section 69-3-225, MCA, is amended to read:
"69-3-225. Overbilling of regulated telecommunications tariff charges -- statute of limitations
for recovery. (1) A person or entity alleging overbilling of tariffed telecommunications charges by a regulated
telecommunications company shall file the action before the commission or a court of competent jurisdiction
within 2 years of the date of overbilling.
(2) This section is intended to be consistent with limitations on actions as provided in 47 U.S.C.
415.
(3) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
(a) "Overbilling" means presenting a bill to a customer of a regulated telecommunications company
that includes charges that overstate the amount owed by the customer pursuant to the tariff for the service as
approved by and on file with the commission.
(b) "Regulated telecommunications company" means all public utility companies that are regulated

in any schedule, including schedules of joint rates, except as approved by the commission, upon or on the
passage of 9 months, or by operation of 69-3-907(1). If the 9-month time period expires prior to commission
approval of a schedule, a utility may waive the time period.
(2) Notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, other than rate adjustments made
pursuant to 69-3-308, the rates, tolls, or charges set forth in any schedule filed with the commission pursuant to
69-3-301 must become effective and be lawful rates, tolls, or charges for the utility service rendered 9 months
after the date upon which the schedule was filed under the rules of practice and procedure for filing as adopted
by the commission or upon commission approval, whichever occurs first, unless the utility waives the 9-month

time period. However, if the rates, tolls, or charges become effective because of the passage of 9 months, the
revenue collected is subject to rebate, plus interest at an annual rate determined by the commission, to the
extent that the rates, tolls, or charges ultimately approved by the commission in its final decision produce
revenue that is less than that collected under the filed schedules. In the case of an investor-owned utility, the
interest rate set by the commission may not exceed the cost of equity capital as last determined by the
commission.
(3) The commission may prescribe rules necessary to effectively administer this section."
Section 5. Section 69-3-305, MCA, is amended to read:
"69-3-305. Deviations from scheduled rates, tolls, and charges. (1) Except as provided in
subsection (5)(a) (4)(a), a public utility may not:
(a) charge, demand, collect, or receive a greater or less compensation for a utility service
performed by it within the state or for any service in connection with a utility service than is specified in the
printed schedules, including schedules of joint rates, that may at the time be in force;
(b) demand, collect, or receive a rate, toll, or charge not specified in the schedules; or
(c) grant a rebate, concession, or special privilege to a consumer or user that, directly or indirectly,
has or may have the effect of changing the rates, tolls, charges, or payments.
(2) The rates, tolls, and charges named in the printed schedules are the lawful rates, tolls, and
charges until the rates, tolls, and charges are changed, as provided in this chapter.
(3) The commission may order refunds or credits of rates, tolls, or charges collected in violation of
this section and may order payment of interest at a reasonable rate on the refunded amount.
(4) The provisions of this section do not prohibit the sharing of profits or revenues with customers
in conjunction with an alternative form of regulation approved under 69-3-809.
(5)(4) (a) A provider of regulated telecommunications service may offer, for a limited period of time,
rebates, price reductions, or waivers of charges in conjunction with promotions, market trials, or other sales-
related activities that are common business practices. Promotional pricing for services to end users does not
require advance approval of the commission. Informational price lists must be filed with the commission on or
before the date that the promotion begins.

(b) A public utility providing electricity or natural gas may offer grants and subsidized loans to
install energy conservation and nonfossil forms of energy generation systems in dwellings.
(c) The commission may define the appropriate scope of promotions, rebates, market trials, and
grants and subsidized loans, either by rule or in response to complaints. The commission may determine
whether a particular sales activity or grant or subsidized loan program under this subsection (4) is unfairly
discriminatory or is not cost-effective. Costs and expenses incurred or revenue foregone with respect to sales
activities and grant and subsidized loan programs that the commission determines are unfairly discriminatory or
not cost-effective are the responsibility of the provider's shareholders in rates set by the commission.
(6)(5) A public utility violating the provisions of this section is subject to the penalty prescribed in 69-
3-206. However, this does not have the effect of suspending, rescinding, invalidating, or in any way affecting
