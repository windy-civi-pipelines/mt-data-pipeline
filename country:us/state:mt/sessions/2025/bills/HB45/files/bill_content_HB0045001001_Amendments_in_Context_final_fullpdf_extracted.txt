8 by the commission or upon commission approval, whichever occurs first, unless the utility waives the 9-month
9 time period. However, if the rates, tolls, or charges become effective because of the passage of 9 months, the
10 revenue collected is subject to rebate, plus interest at an annual rate determined by the commission, to the

13 within 2 years of the date of overbilling.
14 (2) This section is intended to be consistent with limitations on actions as provided in 47 U.S.C.
15 415.
16 (3) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
17 (a) "Overbilling" means presenting a bill to a customer of a regulated telecommunications company

2 passage of 9 months, or by operation of 69-3-907(1). If the 9-month time period expires prior to commission
3 approval of a schedule, a utility may waive the time period.
4 (2) Notwithstanding any provision of this title to the contrary, other than rate adjustments made
5 pursuant to 69-3-308, the rates, tolls, or charges set forth in any schedule filed with the commission pursuant to
6 69-3-301 must become effective and be lawful rates, tolls, or charges for the utility service rendered 9 months
7 after the date upon which the schedule was filed under the rules of practice and procedure for filing as adopted
8 by the commission or upon commission approval, whichever occurs first, unless the utility waives the 9-month
9 time period. However, if the rates, tolls, or charges become effective because of the passage of 9 months, the
10 revenue collected is subject to rebate, plus interest at an annual rate determined by the commission, to the
11 extent that the rates, tolls, or charges ultimately approved by the commission in its final decision produce
12 revenue that is less than that collected under the filed schedules. In the case of an investor-owned utility, the

5 (5)(4) (a) A provider of regulated telecommunications service may offer, for a limited period of time,
6 rebates, price reductions, or waivers of charges in conjunction with promotions, market trials, or other sales-

9 before the date that the promotion begins.
10 (b) A public utility providing electricity or natural gas may offer grants and subsidized loans to
11 install energy conservation and nonfossil forms of energy generation systems in dwellings.

15 discriminatory or is not cost-effective. Costs and expenses incurred or revenue foregone with respect to sales
16 activities and grant and subsidized loan programs that the commission determines are unfairly discriminatory or
17 not cost-effective are the responsibility of the provider's shareholders in rates set by the commission.
18 (6)(5) A public utility violating the provisions of this section is subject to the penalty prescribed in 69-
