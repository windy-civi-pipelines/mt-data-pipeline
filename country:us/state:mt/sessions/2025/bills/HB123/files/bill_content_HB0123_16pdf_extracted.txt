14 use a part of a building as premises licensed for on-premises consumption of alcoholic beverages, except as
15 otherwise allowed in 16-3-302(4). The licensed retailer must demonstrate that it has adequate control over all
16 alcoholic beverages to prevent self-service, service to underage persons, and service to persons who are

18 separated from the rest of the building by permanent walls but may have inside access to the rest of the
19 building at all times even if the businesses or uses in the other part of the building are unrelated to the
20 operation of the premises in which the alcoholic beverages are served. A licensee may lease the kitchen or
21 another specified area to allow another business entity to operate a business within its premises without
22 permanent floor-to-ceiling walls and without a concession agreement if the other business does not take orders
23 for, serve, or deliver alcohol and has a separate point of sale system. If the premises are located in a portion of
24 a building, the licensed retailer must be able to demonstrate that there are adequate safeguards in place to
25 prevent public access to alcoholic beverages after hours, either by the presence of a lockable door or other
26 security features such as rolling gates, locking cabinets, tap locks, or key card access. For the purposes of this
27 subsection (1)(a), the term "self-service" does not include when customers self-pour beer and wine after an on-

24 control of the licensee and not interrupted by any area in which the licensee does not have adequate control
