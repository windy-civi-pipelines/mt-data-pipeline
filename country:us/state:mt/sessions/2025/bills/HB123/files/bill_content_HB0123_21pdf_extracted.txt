15 "16-3-311. Suitable premises for licensed retail establishments. (1) (a) A licensed retailer may
16 use a part of a building as premises licensed for on-premises consumption of alcoholic beverages, except as
17 otherwise allowed in 16-3-302(4). The licensed retailer must demonstrate that it has adequate control over all
18 alcoholic beverages to prevent self-service, service to underage persons, and service to persons who are
19 actually or apparently intoxicated. Except as provided in subsections (8), (10), and (11), the premises must be
20 separated from the rest of the building by permanent walls but may have inside access to the rest of the
21 building at all times even if the businesses or uses in the other part of the building are unrelated to the
22 operation of the premises in which the alcoholic beverages are served. A licensee may lease the kitchen or
23 another specified area to allow another business entity to operate a business within its premises without
24 permanent floor-to-ceiling walls and without a concession agreement if the other business does not take orders
25 for, serve, or deliver alcohol and has a separate point of sale system. If the premises are located in a portion of
26 a building, the licensed retailer must be able to demonstrate that there are adequate safeguards in place to
27 prevent public access to alcoholic beverages after hours, either by the presence of a lockable door or other
28 security features such as rolling gates, locking cabinets, tap locks, or key card access. For the purposes of this

26 control of the licensee and not interrupted by any area in which the licensee does not have adequate control
