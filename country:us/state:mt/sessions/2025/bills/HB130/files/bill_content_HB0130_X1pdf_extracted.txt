Section 2:
Section 1. Section 76-13-115, MCA, is amended to read:
"76-13-115. State fire policy. The legislature finds and declares that:
(1) the safety of the public and of firefighters is paramount in all wildfire suppression activities;
(2) it is a priority to minimize property and resource loss resulting from wildfire and to minimize
expense to Montana taxpayers, which is generally accomplished through an aggressive and rapid initial attack
effort;
(3) interagency cooperation and coordination among local, state, and federal agencies are
intended and encouraged, including cooperation when restricting activity or closing areas to access becomes
necessary;
(4) fire prevention, hazard reduction, and loss mitigation are fundamental components of this
policy;
(5) all property in Montana has wildfire protection from a recognized fire protection entity;
(6) the department has a duty to engage in wildfire suppression activities in the state regardless of
land ownership if the department determines that the federal wildfire suppression activities within 5 miles of
department or county wildland fire protection are not consistent with 76-13-104. The department may, at its sole
discretion, bill the responsible recognized federal protection agency for costs incurred in suppression when
appropriate.

public safety and for reducing risk and loss; and
(9)(10) catastrophic wildland fire in wildland-urban interface areas resulting from inadequate federal
