17 WHEREAS, Montana has a deeply rooted commitment to the transparency and accountability of
18 government, as demonstrated by the protections offered by the right to know in Article II, section 9, and the
19 right of participation in the operations of government agencies in Article II, section 8, of the Montana
20 Constitution; and
21 WHEREAS, the Montana Constitution has enshrined access to public information in the right to know in
22 Article II, section 9, which states that "No person shall be deprived of the right to examine documents or to
23 observe the deliberations of all public bodies or agencies of state government and its subdivisions, except in
24 cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure"; and
25 WHEREAS, the right of participation in Article II, section 8, of the Montana Constitution also ensures
26 that the public must be given a reasonable opportunity to participate in the operation of government agencies
27 prior to the final decision as may be provided by law; and
28 WHEREAS, these fundamental rights are the foundation on which every Montanan is able to exercise

69th Legislature 2025 LC 1389
1 the power to hold elected officials accountable for their actions and decisions; and
2 WHEREAS, in recognition of its commitment to the principles of transparency and accountability, the
3 Montana Legislature has had a long-standing policy of allowing public access to the information collected in
4 legislative bill drafting files; and
5 WHEREAS, restoring and maintaining public access to bill drafting files will encourage the public's
6 assertion of the right to know and facilitate more meaningful participation under the right of participation in the
7 legislative process; and
8 WHEREAS, the Speech or Debate clause in Article V, section 8, of the Montana Constitution states
9 that a legislator "shall not be questioned in any other place for any speech or debate in the legislature"; and
10 WHEREAS, providing access to the public to a bill drafting file in furtherance of the right to know and
11 the right of participation as protected in the Montana Constitution does not in and of itself involve questioning a
12 legislator's speech or debate; and
13 WHEREAS, the Speech or Debate clause provides a legislator the privilege from having records or
14 communications regarding legitimate legislative acts used against the legislator, but the clause does not create
15 a privilege in the disclosure of the legislator's communications to another person, and therefore the materials
16 disclosed in a bill drafting file may not be used to prosecute a legislator, either criminally or civilly, for the
17 legislator's legitimate legislative acts; and
18 WHEREAS, no other privilege can exist to protect communications between a legislator and a bill
19 drafter because legal privileges are waived when the privilege-holder voluntarily discloses the privileged
20 information to another person, including a bill drafter, and because the bill drafter is a third party employed by
21 the Legislative Branch and not employed by the individual legislator; and
22 WHEREAS, bill drafting files often contain communications between a bill drafter and parties that are
23 not legislators, which are clearly not protected from disclosure under the Montana Constitution, whether or not a
24 legislator is included in the communications; and
25 WHEREAS, the heart of the Speech or Debate clause is to protect a legislator's legitimate legislative
26 acts from undue prosecution or harassment from either the Executive Branch or the Judicial Branch of
27 government, with which the Legislative Branch is a co-equal branch of government; and
28 WHEREAS, the Legislature deems it appropriate to strike a balance between the public's right to know

1 and the individual legislator's immunities under the Speech or Debate clause by providing access to bill drafting
2 files while protecting a legislator against prosecution for legitimate legislative acts that would otherwise be
3 constitutionally protected.

5 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
6
7 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Legislative bill drafting files -- privileged content -- definitions. (1)
8 Legislative bill drafting files are public records as defined in 2-6-1002 and must be provided upon request
9 pursuant to Title 2, chapter 6, part 10.
10 (2) A legislative bill drafting file contains the history of the drafting, preparation, and process from
11 request to introduction of a bill draft. The contents of a bill drafting file may include but are not limited to:
12 (a) draft versions of a bill prior to introduction;
13 (b) bills or laws from other states;
14 (c) uniform acts or model legislation from any source;
15 (d) reports, articles, papers, or any other research conducted on the topic of the bill draft;
16 (e) legal analysis;
17 (f) e-mails and other communications between the legislator and the bill drafter;
18 (g) e-mails and other communications between the bill drafter and any third party, whether or not
19 the legislator was included in those communications; and
20 (h) any other resources or materials collected or compiled during the course of drafting the bill.
21 (3) (a) The legislative privilege granted under Article V, section 8, of the Montana constitution to a
22 legislator is an immunity from prosecution in a criminal or civil action for the legislator's legitimate legislative
23 acts. The records, including communications, contained in a legislative bill drafting file may not be used as
24 evidence of legislative acts in a judicial proceeding against a legislator.
25 (b) The legislative privilege granted under Article V, section 8, of the Montana constitution to a
26 legislator as it pertains to legislative bill drafting files does not create a privilege of confidentiality against
27 disclosure under Article II, section 9, of the Montana constitution and Title 2, chapter 6, parts 10 through 12, for
28 any communications or other records that are generated in the course of drafting a bill, shared with another

69th Legislature 2025 LC 1389
1 person, or preserved in the legislative bill drafting file.
2 (c) A legislator is entitled to assert legislative privilege to prohibit disclosure of writings or
3 documents that are kept private by the legislator and not shared with another person. A legislator waives that
4 privilege if the legislator voluntarily provides the writings or documents related to a bill drafting file to another
5 person.
6 (d) A legislator is entitled to assert legislative privilege to prohibit disclosure of communications or
7 documents that are exchanged between the legislator and the legislator's personal staff when the legislator has
8 an expectation of privacy. A legislator waives that privilege if the legislator voluntarily provides communications
9 or documents related to a bill drafting file to a third party.
10 (e) Legislative privilege does not apply to communications between a legislator and chamber staff
11 or legislative branch staff and does not prevent those communications from being disclosed pursuant to a
12 public records request because the chamber staff and legislative branch staff are employed by the legislature in
13 its entirety and not by an individual legislator.
14 (4) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
15 (a) "Chamber staff" means the staff of the house of representatives and the staff of the senate as
16 provided for in 5-2-221 and legislative rules.
17 (b) "Legislative branch staff" means the staff of the:
18 (i) legislative services division provided for in 5-11-111;
19 (ii) legislative fiscal division provided for in 5-12-301; and
20 (iii) legislative audit division provided for in 5-13-301.
21 (c) "Personal staff" means a legislative aide employed by an individual legislator and designated
22 pursuant to legislative rules.
