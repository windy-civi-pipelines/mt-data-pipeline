nuisance in this state to the extent common law is inconsistent with this chapter.

Section 5:
Section 4. Liability for a public nuisance. (1) A person may be subject to a public nuisance cause
of action only if that person proximately caused the public nuisance at the time the public nuisance was
- 3 - Authorized Print Version – HB 791
ENROLLED BILL
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 791
created, which includes controlling, or instructing another person to engage in, the activity that proximately
caused the public nuisance.
(2) Every successive owner of property who neglects to abate a continuing public nuisance upon
or in the use of the property that was created by a former owner is liable for the public nuisance in the same
manner as the one who first created it.
(3) No lapse of time can legalize a public nuisance amounting to an actual obstruction of public
right.

Section 6:
Section 5. Public nuisance actions by government. (1) A public nuisance cause of action is
available to a government entity only if the public nuisance is within the jurisdiction of that government entity.
Past, current, or future expenditures made by a government entity related to injunction of or any other response
to a public nuisance does not itself confer standing to file or maintain a public nuisance action.
(2) In a public nuisance action brought by a government entity, the only remedies against a public
nuisance are:
(a) indictment or information as regulated by Titles 45 and 46;
(b) injunctive relief to enjoin an unlawful activity that is proximately causing a public nuisance; and
(c) monetary and nonmonetary resources, if quantifiable, that a court determines are reasonably

available to a private person only if that person has sustained a special injury proximately caused by the public
nuisance and only if the person can show the existence of the special injury by clear and convincing evidence.
(2) A special injury is an injury that is different in kind, not just in degree, from an injury sustained
by the general public exercising the same public right. A special injury is not one based upon impairment of the
spiritual, cultural, or emotional significance associated with a navigable lake, river, bay, stream, canal, or basin
or a public park, square, street, road, or highway.
(3) Financial expenditures made by a private person related to an injunction of, or any other
response to, a public nuisance does not constitute a special injury sufficient to confer standing on the person to
file or maintain a public nuisance action.

compensatory damages for the special injury.

injured party. A public nuisance may be abated by any public body a government entity or officer authorized
by law. A person may abate a public nuisance that is specially injurious to that person by removing or, if
necessary, destroying the thing that constitutes the nuisance, as long as doing so would not constitute without
committing a breach of the peace or cause doing unnecessary injury. Nothing in this section alters the remedies
to a government entity or private person in a public nuisance cause of action."

Section 9:
Section 8. Action for private nuisance. An action for private nuisance may be brought by a person
- 5 - Authorized Print Version – HB 791

nuisance.

Section 9. Liability for private nuisance. (1) A person may be subject to a private nuisance cause
of action only if that person, or the person's agent, proximately caused the private nuisance or, if that person is
not available for a private nuisance lawsuit or cannot satisfy a private nuisance judgment, the person who owns
or controls the real property where the private nuisance exists.
(2) Every successive owner or controller of real property who neglects to abate a continuing
private nuisance upon or in the use of the property that was created under previous ownership is liable for the
private nuisance in the same manner as the one who owned or controlled the real property when the private
nuisance was created.

Section 11:
Section 10. Remedies for private nuisances. The remedies against a private nuisance are:
(1) injunctive relief to enjoin an activity proximately causing the private nuisance;
(2) monetary and nonmonetary resources, if quantifiable, that a court determines are reasonably

Section 11. Emergency abatement of private nuisance by injured party. A person injured by a
private nuisance may abate it by removing or, if necessary, destroying the thing that constitutes the private
nuisance so long as doing so would not constitute committing a breach of the peace or cause unnecessary
injury. When a private nuisance results from a mere omission of the wrongdoer and cannot be abated without
entering upon the wrongdoer's land, reasonable notice must be given to the wrongdoer before entering to abate
the private nuisance. Nothing in this section alters the remedies available in a private nuisance cause of action.
