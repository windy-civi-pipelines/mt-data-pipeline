5 compensatory damages for the special injury.

16 to a government entity or private person in a public nuisance cause of action."

25 or controls the real property where the private nuisance exists.
26 (2) Every successive owner or controller of real property who neglects to abate a continuing
27 private nuisance upon or in the use of the property that was created under previous ownership is liable for the

15 cause unnecessary injury. When a private nuisance results from a mere omission of the wrongdoer and cannot
16 be abated without entering upon the wrongdoer's land, reasonable notice must be given to the wrongdoer
17 before entering to abate the private nuisance. Nothing in this section alters the remedies available in a private
18 nuisance cause of action.
