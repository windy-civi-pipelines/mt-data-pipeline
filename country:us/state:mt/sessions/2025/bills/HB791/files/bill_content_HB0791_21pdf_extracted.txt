16 action.

18 nuisance are:
19 (a) indictment or information as regulated by Titles 45 and 46;

16 (3) Financial expenditures made by a private person related to an injunction of, or any other

20 compensatory damages for the special injury.

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0791.2
1 constitutes the private nuisance so long as doing so would not constitute committing a breach of the peace or

9 cause of action is available to a private person only if that person has sustained a special injury proximately
10 caused by the public nuisance and only if the person can show the existence of the special injury by clear and
11 convincing evidence.
12 (2) A special injury is an injury that is different in kind, not just in degree, from an injury sustained
13 by the general public exercising the same public right. A SPECIAL INJURY IS NOT ONE BASED UPON IMPAIRMENT OF
14 THE SPIRITUAL, CULTURAL, OR EMOTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE ASSOCIATED WITH A NAVIGABLE LAKE, RIVER, BAY, STREAM,
15 CANAL, OR BASIN OR A PUBLIC PARK, SQUARE, STREET, ROAD, OR HIGHWAY.
16 (3) Financial expenditures made by a private person related to an injunction of, or any other
17 response to, a public nuisance does not constitute a special injury sufficient to confer standing on the person to
18 file or maintain a public nuisance action.
19 (4) The remedy available to a private person in a public nuisance action is limited solely to
20 compensatory damages for the special injury.
21 (5) The abatement of a public nuisance pursuant to 27-30-204 does not preclude the right of a
22 person to recover compensatory damages under this section.
23 (6) Private persons may not bring a class action for special injuries arising out of a public nuisance.

9 NEW SECTION. Section 9. Liability for private nuisance. (1) A person may be liable under
10 SUBJECT TO a private nuisance cause of action only if that person, OR THE PERSON'S AGENT, proximately caused
11 the private nuisance or, if that person is not available for a private nuisance lawsuit or cannot satisfy a private
12 nuisance judgment, the person who owns or controls the real property where the private nuisance exists.
13 (2) Every successive owner or controller of real property who neglects to abate a continuing
14 private nuisance upon or in the use of the property that was created under previous ownership is liable for the
15 private nuisance in the same manner as the one who owned or controlled the real property when the private
16 nuisance was created.
17
18 NEW SECTION. Section 10. Remedies for private nuisances. The remedies against a private

24 nuisance itself.
25 (3) damages proximately caused by the private nuisance.
26
27 NEW SECTION. Section 11. Emergency abatement of private nuisance by injured party. A

- 6 - Authorized Print Version – HB 791

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0791.2
1 constitutes the private nuisance so long as doing so would not constitute committing a breach of the peace or
2 cause unnecessary injury. When a private nuisance results from a mere omission of the wrongdoer and cannot
3 be abated without entering upon the wrongdoer's land, reasonable notice must be given to the wrongdoer
4 before entering to abate the private nuisance. Nothing in this section alters the remedies available in a private
5 nuisance cause of action.
