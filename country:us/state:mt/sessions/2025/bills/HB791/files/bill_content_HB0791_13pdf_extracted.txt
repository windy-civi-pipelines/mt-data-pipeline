25 caused by the public nuisance and only if the person can show the existence of the special injury by clear and
26 convincing evidence.
27 (2) A special injury is an injury that is different in kind, not just in degree, from an injury sustained
28 by the general public exercising the same public right.

****
69th Legislature 2025 HB 791.1

5 compensatory damages for the special injury.
6 (5) The abatement of a public nuisance pursuant to 27-30-204 does not preclude the right of a

19 brought by a person whose property is injuriously affected or whose personal enjoyment of property is lessened
20 by the private nuisance.
21
22 NEW SECTION. Section 9. Liability for private nuisance. (1) A person may be liable under a
23 private nuisance cause of action only if that person proximately caused the private nuisance or, if that person is

25 or controls the real property where the private nuisance exists.
26 (2) Every successive owner or controller of real property who neglects to abate a continuing
27 private nuisance upon or in the use of the property that was created under previous ownership is liable for the
28 private nuisance in the same manner as the one who owned or controlled the real property when the private

15 cause unnecessary injury. When a private nuisance results from a mere omission of the wrongdoer and cannot
16 be abated without entering upon the wrongdoer's land, reasonable notice must be given to the wrongdoer
17 before entering to abate the private nuisance. Nothing in this section alters the remedies available in a private
