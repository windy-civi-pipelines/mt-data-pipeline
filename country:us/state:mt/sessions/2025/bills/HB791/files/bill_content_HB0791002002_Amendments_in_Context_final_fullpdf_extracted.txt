15 NEW SECTION. Section 4. Public nuisance actions by government. (1) A public nuisance cause
16 of action is available to a government entity only if the public nuisance is within the jurisdiction of that
17 government entity. Past, current, or future expenditures made by a government entity related to injunction of or
18 any other response to a public nuisance does not itself confer standing to file or maintain a public nuisance
19 action.
20 (2) In a public nuisance action brought by a government entity, the only remedies against a public
21 nuisance are:
22 (a) indictment or information as regulated by Titles 45 and 46;
23 (b) injunctive relief to enjoin an unlawful activity that is proximately causing a public nuisance; and
24 (c) monetary and nonmonetary resources, if quantifiable, that a court determines are reasonably
25 necessary to abate the public nuisance based on relevant and reliable cost factors and established by clear and
26 convincing evidence. All resources provided under this subsection (2) must be spent to abate the public
27 nuisance itself.

19 CANAL, OR BASIN OR A PUBLIC PARK, SQUARE, STREET, ROAD, OR HIGHWAY.
20 (3) Financial expenditures made by a private person related to an injunction of, or any other

24 compensatory damages for the special injury.
