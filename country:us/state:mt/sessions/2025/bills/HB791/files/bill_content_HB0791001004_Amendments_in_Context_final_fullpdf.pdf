2 (3) No lapse of time can legalize a public nuisance amounting to an actual obstruction of public
3 right.
4
5 NEW SECTION. Section 5. Public nuisance actions by government. (1) A public nuisance cause
6 of action is available to a government entity only if the public nuisance is within the jurisdiction of that
7 government entity. Past, current, or future expenditures made by a government entity related to injunction of or
8 any other response to a public nuisance does not itself confer standing to file or maintain a public nuisance
9 action.
10 (2) In a public nuisance action brought by a government entity, the only remedies against a public
11 nuisance are:
12 (a) indictment or information as regulated by Titles 45 and 46;
13 (b) injunctive relief to enjoin an unlawful activity that is proximately causing a public nuisance; and
14 (c) monetary and nonmonetary resources, if quantifiable, that a court determines are reasonably
15 necessary to abate the public nuisance based on relevant and reliable cost factors and established by clear and
16 convincing evidence. All resources provided under this subsection (2) must be spent to abate the public
17 nuisance itself.

20 (b) damages of any kind, including economic, noneconomic, and exemplary damages.

22 political subdivision of the state, or any other governing authority, including a tribal government.
23
24 NEW SECTION. Section 6. Private cause of action for public nuisance. (1) A public nuisance
25 cause of action is available to a private person only if that person has sustained a special injury proximately
26 caused by the public nuisance and only if the person can show the existence of the special injury by clear and
27 convincing evidence.
28 (2) A special injury is an injury that is different in kind, not just in degree, from an injury sustained

1 by the general public exercising the same public right.
2 (3) Financial expenditures made by a private person related to an injunction of, or any other
3 response to, a public nuisance does not constitute a special injury sufficient to confer standing on the person to
4 file or maintain a public nuisance action.
5 (4) The remedy available to a private person in a public nuisance action is limited solely to
6 compensatory damages for the special injury.
7 (5) The abatement of a public nuisance pursuant to 27-30-204 does not preclude the right of a
8 person to recover compensatory damages under this section.
9 (6) Private persons may not bring a class action for special injuries arising out of a public nuisance.
10
11 Section 7. Section 27-30-204, MCA, is amended to read:

13 injured party. A public nuisance may be abated by any public body a government entity or officer authorized
14 by law. A person may abate a public nuisance that is specially injurious to that person by removing or, if
15 necessary, destroying the thing that constitutes the nuisance, as long as doing so would not constitute without
16 committing a breach of the peace or cause doing unnecessary injury. Nothing in this section alters the remedies
17 to a government entity or private person in a public nuisance cause of action."
18
19 NEW SECTION. Section 8. Action for private nuisance. An action for private nuisance may be
20 brought by a person whose property is injuriously affected or whose personal enjoyment of property is lessened
21 by the private nuisance.
22
23 NEW SECTION. Section 9. Liability for private nuisance. (1) A person may be liable under a
24 private nuisance cause of action only if that person proximately caused the private nuisance or, if that person is
25 not available for a private nuisance lawsuit or cannot satisfy a private nuisance judgment, the person who owns
26 or controls the real property where the private nuisance exists.
27 (2) Every successive owner or controller of real property who neglects to abate a continuing
28 private nuisance upon or in the use of the property that was created under previous ownership is liable for the

1 private nuisance in the same manner as the one who owned or controlled the real property when the private
2 nuisance was created.
3
4 NEW SECTION. Section 10. Remedies for private nuisances. The remedies against a private
5 nuisance are:
6 (1) injunctive relief to enjoin an activity proximately causing the private nuisance;
7 (2) monetary and nonmonetary resources, if quantifiable, that a court determines are reasonably
8 necessary to abate the private nuisance based on relevant and reliable cost factors and established by clear
9 and convincing evidence. All resources provided under this subsection must be spent to abate the private
10 nuisance itself.
11 (3) damages proximately caused by the private nuisance.
12
13 NEW SECTION. Section 11. Emergency abatement of private nuisance by injured party. A
14 person injured by a private nuisance may abate it by removing or, if necessary, destroying the thing that
15 constitutes the private nuisance so long as doing so would not constitute committing a breach of the peace or
16 cause unnecessary injury. When a private nuisance results from a mere omission of the wrongdoer and cannot
17 be abated without entering upon the wrongdoer's land, reasonable notice must be given to the wrongdoer
18 before entering to abate the private nuisance. Nothing in this section alters the remedies available in a private
19 nuisance cause of action.
20
21 NEW SECTION. Section 12. Repealer. The following sections of the Montana Code Annotated are
22 repealed:
23 27-30-102. Distinction between public and private nuisances.
