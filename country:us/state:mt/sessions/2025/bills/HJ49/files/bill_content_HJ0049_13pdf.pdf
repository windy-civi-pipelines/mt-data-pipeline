9 WHEREAS, United States Highway 212 proceeds eastward from Yellowstone National Park, passing
10 through the Crow and Northern Cheyenne Indian reservations, and across southeastern Montana into
11 Wyoming, South Dakota, and Minnesota; and
12 WHEREAS, U.S. Highway 212 in Montana is a roadway of incredible paradoxes, providing some of the
13 most beautiful scenery to thousands of motorists every year along the Beartooth Highway section between
14 Cooke City and Red Lodge and some of the most treacherous, isolated, and fatal conditions to many other
15 motorists on the section of road east of Billings; and
16 WHEREAS, much of the section of U.S. Highway 212 east of Billings is plagued by poor road surface
17 conditions, limited winter maintenance services, lack of cellular phone service, and limited emergency service
18 options; and
19 WHEREAS, U.S. Highway 212 had the highest fatality rate from 2013 to 2022 of any rural roadway in
20 the state, and Bighorn County, which ranks 16th in county population in the state and is primarily served by
21 U.S. Highway 212, had more roadway fatalities from 2013 to 2022 than any other county except Yellowstone,
22 Flathead, and Missoula counties; and
23 WHEREAS, motorists involved in collisions or experiencing mechanical breakdowns on U.S. Highway
24 212 east of Billings often find themselves stranded and without assistance; and
25 WHEREAS, a greater understanding of the ongoing problems on U.S. Highway 212 east of Billings
26 could not only help decrease fatalities on that roadway but also serve as a foundation for developing safer rural
27 roadways in other parts of the state.
