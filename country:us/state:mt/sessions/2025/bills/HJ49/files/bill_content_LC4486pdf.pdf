7
8 WHEREAS, United States Highway 212 proceeds eastward from Yellowstone National Park, passing
9 through the Crow and Northern Cheyenne Indian reservations, and across southeastern Montana into
10 Wyoming, South Dakota, and Minnesota; and
11 WHEREAS, U.S. Highway 212 in Montana is a roadway of incredible paradoxes, providing some of the
12 most beautiful scenery to thousands of motorists every year along the Beartooth Highway section between
13 Cooke City and Red Lodge and some of the most treacherous, isolated, and fatal conditions to many other
14 motorists on the section of road east of Billings; and
15 WHEREAS, much of the section of U.S. Highway 212 east of Billings is plagued by poor road surface
16 conditions, limited winter maintenance services, lack of cellular phone service, and limited emergency service
17 options; and
18 WHEREAS, U.S. Highway 212 had the highest fatality rate from 2013 to 2022 of any rural roadway in
19 the state, and Bighorn County, which ranks 16th in county population in the state and is primarily served by
20 U.S. Highway 212, had more roadway fatalities from 2013 to 2022 than any other county except Yellowstone,
21 Flathead, and Missoula counties; and
22 WHEREAS, motorists involved in collisions or experiencing mechanical breakdowns on U.S. Highway
23 212 east of Billings often find themselves stranded and without assistance; and
24 WHEREAS, a greater understanding of the ongoing problems on U.S. Highway 212 east of Billings
25 could not only help decrease fatalities on that roadway but also serve as a foundation for developing safer rural
26 roadways in other parts of the state.
27
28 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF
- 1 - LC 4486

69th Legislature LC 4486

8 and information from local governments, communities, and individuals who live and work along U.S. Highway
9 212 east of Billings; and
10 (3) examine solutions that have been used to alleviate deaths and dangerous conditions and
11 situations on other rural roadways in Montana and in other states.
