CONFORMITY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS
As required pursuant to section 5-11-112(1)(c), MCA, it is the Legislative Services Division's
statutory responsibility to conduct "legal review of draft bills". The comments noted below
regarding conformity with state and federal constitutions are provided to assist the Legislature
in making its own determination as to the constitutionality of the bill. The comments are based
on an analysis of jurisdictionally relevant state and federal constitutional law as applied to the
bill. The comments are not written for the purpose of influencing whether the bill should
become law but are written to provide information relevant to the Legislature's consideration
of this bill. The comments are not a formal legal opinion and are not a substitute for the
judgment of the judiciary, which has the authority to determine the constitutionality of a law
in the context of a specific case.
This review is intended to inform the bill draft requestor of potential constitutional conformity
issues that may be raised by the bill as drafted. This review IS NOT dispositive of the issue of
constitutional conformity and the general rule as repeatedly stated by the Montana Supreme
Court is that an enactment of the Legislature is presumed to be constitutional unless it is
proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the enactment is unconstitutional. See Alexander v.
Bozeman Motors, Inc., 356 Mont. 439, 234 P.3d 880 (2010); Eklund v. Wheatland County,
351 Mont. 370, 212 P.3d 297 (2009); St. v. Pyette, 337 Mont. 265, 159 P.3d 232 (2007); and
Elliott v. Dept. of Revenue, 334 Mont. 195, 146 P.3d 741 (2006).
Legal Reviewer Comments:
SB 490, as drafted revises timelines for voter registration, including election day voter
registration. SB 490 amends 13-2-304 to include a new subsection (3) that provides:
(3) In a federal election, an elector may register or change the elector's voter
registration information after the close of regular registration as provided in 13-2-301 and

vote in the election if the election administrator in the county where the elector resides
receives and verifies the elector's voter registration information:
(a) prior to the close of business on the Friday before the election;
(b) between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on the Saturday before the election;
(c) prior to noon on the day before the election; or
(d) prior to noon on the day of the election.
Prior to 2021, 13-2-304 provided for late registration “prior to the close of the polls on election
day.” 13-2-304(1)(a) (2019). In 2021, the Legislature enacted House Bill No. 176, which
amended 13-2-304 to move the deadline for voter registration from the close of the polls on
election day to noon the day before election day. (HB 176, section 2.) Litigation over the
constitutionality of HB 176 ensued and ultimately reached the Montana Supreme Court in
Montana Democratic Party v. Jacobsen, 2024 MT 66, (Jacobsen).
While in Jacobsen, the Supreme Court acknowledged that Art. IV, section 3, of the Montana
Constitution provides that the Legislature “may provide for a system of poll booth registration”,
the Court concluded that this provision does not mean that the Legislature has “unfettered
authority to terminate [registration] outside of constitutional constraints.” MDP at ¶ 65 and ¶ 68.
Ultimately, the Supreme Court held that “13-2-304, MCA, impermissibly interferes with the
right to vote” and did “not survive strict scrutiny and is therefore unconstitutional on its face.”
MDP at ¶ 68 and ¶ 84.
SB 490, as drafted, limits election day registration to “prior to noon on the day of the election”
instead of “prior to the close of the polls on election day” as provided by 13-2-304(1)(a) before
the enactment of HB 176. Therefore, SB 490 may raise a potential constitutional conformity
question as to whether this legislation conflicts the holding in Montana Democratic Party v.
Jacobsen.
