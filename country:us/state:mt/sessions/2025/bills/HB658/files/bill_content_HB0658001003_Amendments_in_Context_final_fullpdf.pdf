1 may not propose for adoption by the local governing body a rule under 50-2-116(1)(j), (2)(c)(iii), or (2)(c)(iv) that
2 is more stringent than the comparable state regulations or guidelines that address the same circumstances.
3 The local board may incorporate by reference comparable state regulations or guidelines.
4 (2) The local board may propose for adoption by the local governing body a rule to implement 50-
5 2-116(1)(j), (2)(c)(iii), or (2)(c)(iv) that is more stringent than comparable state regulations or guidelines only if
6 the local board makes a written finding, after a public hearing and public comment and based on evidence in
7 the record, that:
8 (a) the proposed local standard or requirement protects public health or the environment; and
9 (b) the local board standard or requirement to be imposed can mitigate harm to the public health or
10 environment and is achievable under current technology.
11 (3) The written finding must reference information and peer-reviewed scientific studies contained in
12 the record that forms the basis for the local board's conclusion. The written finding must also include
13 information from the hearing record regarding the costs to the regulated community that are directly attributable
14 to the proposed local standard or requirement.
15 (4) (a) A person affected by a rule of the local board adopted after January 1, 1990, and before
16 April 14, 1995, that that person believes to be more stringent than comparable state regulations or guidelines
17 may petition the local board to review the rule. If the local board determines that the rule is more stringent than
18 comparable state regulations or guidelines, the local board shall comply with this section by either revising the
19 rule to conform to the state regulations or guidelines or making the written finding, as provided under
20 subsection (2), within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 12 months after receiving the petition. A
21 petition under this section does not relieve the petitioner of the duty to comply with the challenged rule. The
22 local board may charge a petition filing fee in an amount not to exceed $250.
23 (b) A person may also petition the local board for a rule review under subsection (4)(a) if the local
24 board adopts a rule after January 1, 1990, in an area in which no state regulations or guidelines existed and the
25 state government subsequently establishes comparable regulations or guidelines that are less stringent than
26 the previously adopted local board rule."
