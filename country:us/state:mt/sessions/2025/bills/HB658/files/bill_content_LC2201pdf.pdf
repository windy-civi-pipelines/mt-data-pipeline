1 the local board makes a written finding, after a public hearing and public comment and based on evidence in
2 the record, that:
3 (a) the proposed local standard or requirement protects public health or the environment; and
4 (b) the local board standard or requirement to be imposed can mitigate harm to the public health or
5 environment and is achievable under current technology.
6 (3) The written finding must reference information and peer-reviewed scientific studies contained in
7 the record that forms the basis for the local board's conclusion. The written finding must also include

11 April 14, 1995, that that person believes to be more stringent than comparable state regulations or guidelines
12 may petition the local board to review the rule. If the local board determines that the rule is more stringent than
13 comparable state regulations or guidelines, the local board shall comply with this section by either revising the
14 rule to conform to the state regulations or guidelines or making the written finding, as provided under
15 subsection (2), within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 12 months after receiving the petition. A
16 petition under this section does not relieve the petitioner of the duty to comply with the challenged rule. The
17 local board may charge a petition filing fee in an amount not to exceed $250.
18 (b) A person may also petition the local board for a rule review under subsection (4)(a) if the local

20 state government subsequently establishes comparable regulations or guidelines that are less stringent than
21 the previously adopted local board rule."
