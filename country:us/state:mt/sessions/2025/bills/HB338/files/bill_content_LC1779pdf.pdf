5 (d) A school district may include in its calculation of ANB a pupil who is enrolled in a program

23 purposes of calculating the 3-year ANB, the superintendent of public instruction shall count the kindergarten
24 enrollment as one-half enrollment and then add the additional kindergarten ANB to the 3-year average ANB for
25 districts offering full-time kindergarten.
