3 value of all property in the state reported by the department of revenue pursuant to 20-9-369 by 1,000 to
4 determine a statewide value mill and then multiplying that amount by 95 mills, or the number of mills calculated
5 by the department of revenue under 15-10-420(8) for the applicable fiscal year. If the forecasted amount differs
6 from the amount determined through the same calculation in the prior fiscal year by $2 million or more and is:
7 (a) less, then the superintendent shall:
8 (i) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school guaranteed
9 tax base ratios used for funding BASE budgets under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number determined by the
10 superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of guaranteed tax base aid distributed to eligible school
11 districts equal to 85% of the decrease in the calculated amount between the 2 years; and
12 (ii) decrease the multiplier used to calculate the statewide elementary and high school mill value
13 per ANB for school retirement guaranteed tax base purposes under 20-9-366 to the nearest whole number
14 determined by the superintendent to result in a decrease in the amount of retirement guaranteed tax base aid
15 distributed to eligible school districts equal to 15% of the decrease in the calculated amount between the 2
16 years;
17 (b) more, then the superintendent shall increase the multipliers used in the guaranteed tax base
18 formulas under 20-9-366 and in the formula for school major maintenance aid under 20-9-525 to the nearest
19 whole number by an amount calculated by the superintendent to result in an increase in the amount of
20 guaranteed tax base aid and school major maintenance aid distributed to eligible counties and school districts
21 equal to 55% of the increase in the calculated amount between the 2 years in the following order, with any
22 amount exceeding the caps under subsections (3)(b)(i) through (3)(b)(iii) flowing to the next mechanism:
23 (i) first, the multiplier used in calculating the statewide mill value per elementary and high school
24 ANB for retirement purposes, not to exceed 305%;
25 (ii) second, the multiplier used in calculating the amount of state school major maintenance aid
26 support for each dollar of local effort, not to exceed 365%; and
27 (iii) third, the multiplier used in calculating the facility guaranteed mill value per ANB for school
28 facility entitlement guaranteed tax base purposes, not to exceed 300%.
