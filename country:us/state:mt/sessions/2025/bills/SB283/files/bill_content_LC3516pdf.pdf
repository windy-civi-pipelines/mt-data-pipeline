16 (3) "Wind generation facility" means any combination of a physically connected wind turbine or
17 turbines, associated prime movers, and other associated property, including appurtenant land and
18 improvements and personal property, that are normally operated together to produce electric power from wind
19 and that have a nameplate capacity greater than or equal to 25 megawatts.
20 (4) "Wind turbine tower" means the structural base of a wind turbine.
21
22 NEW SECTION. Section 2. Wind turbine tower height requirements. (1) Beginning on January 1,
23 2026, a wind turbine tower constructed or installed may not exceed 350 feet in height, as measured from the
24 natural ground level at the base of the tower to the middle of the turbine rotor hub.
25 (2) This section does not apply to wind turbine towers constructed or installed prior to January 1,
26 2026.
