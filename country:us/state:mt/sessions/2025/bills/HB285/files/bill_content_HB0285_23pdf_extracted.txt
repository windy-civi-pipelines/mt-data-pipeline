19 WHEREAS, the Department of Environmental Quality convened a multidisciplinary work group to
20 review and recommend updates to the Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) during the summer of 2024.
21 That work group recommended that the Legislature confirm the importance of MEPA as a valuable data
22 gathering and analytical tool intended to provide sound and objective information to the public, agency
23 decisionmakers, and lawmakers as each strives to make fully informed decisions; and
24 WHEREAS, Article II, section 3, of the Montana Constitution enumerates inalienable rights, including
25 the right to a clean and healthful environment, rights to pursue life's basic necessities, rights to enjoy and
26 defend their lives and liberties, rights to acquire, possess, and protect property, and rights to seek safety,
27 health, and happiness in all lawful ways, and neither the Constitution nor the Legislature through the passage of
28 MEPA has identified a prioritization of one right over any other. As such, MEPA requires a balanced view of
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – HB 285
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0285.2
1 competing social, economic, and environmental goals and potential impacts in order to promote the overall
2 health, safety, and welfare of Montanans; and
3 WHEREAS, the Legislature and the Supreme Court are in agreement that MEPA is purely procedural
4 in nature and intended to foster more informed decisionmaking on state actions, and that the process is
5 intended to provide a transparent public forum in which to analyze and disclose potential significant impacts to
6 Montana's environment and to provide a clearer understanding of the rationale behind state permitting
7 decisions; and
8 WHEREAS, the Legislature has made the act's intent clear in "A Guide to the Montana Environmental
9 Policy Act," which states that "MEPA is not an act that controls or sets regulations for any specific land or
10 resource use. It is not a preservation, wilderness, or antidevelopment act. It is not a device for preventing
11 industrial or agricultural development. If implemented correctly and efficiently, MEPA should encourage and
12 foster economic development that is environmentally and socially sound. By taking the time to identify the
13 environmental impacts of a state decision before the decision is made and including the public in the process,
14 MEPA is intended to foster better decisionmaking for people and the environment"; and
15 WHEREAS, the permissibility of environmental impacts is not determined by MEPA, but through
16 compliance with standards and criteria adopted under the authority granted by the Legislature in substantive
17 environmental statutes. As such, MEPA is not intended to force, hinder, or preclude particular outcomes or
18 decisions, and the statute has no independent regulatory authority, and no means to withhold, deny, or modify
19 permits independently administered under Montana's substantive environmental regulations; and
20 WHEREAS, Article IX, section 1, of the Montana Constitution clearly assigns the Legislature with the
21 responsibility to administer and enforce a system of laws to protect the environment against unreasonable
22 degradation, and the Legislature has duly enacted substantive statutes to provide these environmental
23 protections. The following statutes and attending rules establish requirements for predictive analysis to satisfy
24 the "anticipatory and preventative" test established by the Supreme Court:
25 Montana Clean Indoor Air Act of 1979, Title 50, chapter 40, part 1;
26 Clean Air Act of Montana, Title 75, chapter 2, parts 1 through 4;
27 Water Quality, Title 75, chapter 5;
28 The Natural Streambed and Land Preservation Act of 1975, Title 75, chapter 7, part 1;
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – HB 285
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0285.2
1 The Montana Solid Waste Management Act, Title 75, chapter 10, part 2;
2 Montana Hazardous Waste Act, Title 75, chapter 10, part 4;
3 Comprehensive Environmental Cleanup and Responsibility Act, Title 75, chapter 10, part 7;
4 Montana Underground Storage Tank Installer and Inspector Licensing and Permitting Act, Title 75,
5 chapter 11, part 2;
6 Montana Underground Storage Tank Act, Title 75, chapter 11, part 5;
7 Montana Major Facility Siting Act, Title 75, chapter 20;
8 Open-Space Land and Voluntary Conservation Easement Act, Title 76, chapter 6;
9 Environmental Control Easement Act, Title 76, chapter 7;
10 The Strip and Underground Mine Siting Act, Title 82, chapter 4, part 1;
11 The Montana Strip and Underground Mine Reclamation Act, Title 82, chapter 4, part 2;
12 The Opencut Mining Act, Title 82, chapter 4, part 4;
13 The Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act, Title 87, chapter 5, part 1;
14 Each of these independent statutes relies on scientific analysis and informed permitting decisions to anticipate,
15 avoid, minimize, or mitigate significant impacts to Montana's environment.
16 WHEREAS, in Bitterrooters for Planning, Inc. v. Montana Department of Environmental Quality, 2017
17 MT 222, 388 Mont. 453, 401 P.3d 712, the Supreme Court stated, "an agency action is a legal cause of an
18 environmental effect only if the agency can prevent the effect through the lawful exercise of its independent
19 authority"; therefore, a challenge brought under MEPA must be limited to deficiencies in analysis or disclosure
20 in areas where legislative direction has been provided to agencies through substantive environmental statutes;
21 and
22 WHEREAS, the 69th Legislature affirms the intent of the 42nd Legislature, which expressed the
23 following statements and positions while passing MEPA into law in 1971: "A major conservation challenge
24 today is to achieve needed development and use of our natural resources while concurrently protecting and
25 enhancing the quality of our environment. MEPA seeks that often elusive middle ground between purely
26 preservationist philosophy and purely exploitive philosophy, and indeed we must soon find that middle ground.
27 As we guide Montana's development, we must use scientific, technological, and sociological expertise."

20 restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or other equitable relief, that the:
21 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;

23 the public interest, a court:
24 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
25 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
26 findings with respect to both.
27 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
28 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – HB 285
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0285.2
1 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
2 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
3 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
4 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
5 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
6 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
7 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
8 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking
9 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
10 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
11 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
12 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
13 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
14 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
15 and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
16 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
17 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
18 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
19 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
20 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
21 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
22 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
23 (f) Attorney fees or costs may not be awarded to the prevailing party in an action alleging
24 noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3.
25 (7)(5) For the purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
26 inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
27 to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
28 that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding

3 in writing any determination of significance made under subsection (1)(b)(iv) (1)(a)(iv) or any recommendation
4 that a determination of significance be made.
5 (9)(7) A project sponsor may request a review of the significance determination or recommendation
6 made under subsection (8) (6) by the appropriate board, if any. The appropriate board may, at its discretion,
7 submit an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue. The period of time between the request
8 for a review and completion of a review under this subsection may not be included for the purposes of
9 determining compliance with the time limits established for environmental review in 75-1-208."

22 before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the decision or the adequacy of the agency's environmental
23 review.
24 (ii) If upon on reviewing the affidavit the court finds that the proffered information is new, material,
25 and significant evidence that was not publicly available before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the
26 decision or to the adequacy of the agency's environmental review, the court shall remand the new evidence to
27 the agency for the agency's consideration and an opportunity to modify its decision or environmental review

3 information in making its decision.
4 (c) (i) The remedies provided in this section for successful challenges to a decision of the agency
5 or the adequacy of the statement are exclusive.
6 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-19-201 and 27-19-314, a court having considered the
7 pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
8 injunction, permanent injunction, or other equitable relief may not enjoin the issuance or effectiveness of a
9 license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court
10 specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not to prevail on the merits of its
11 complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in the absence of a temporary
12 restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or other equitable relief, that the:
13 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
14 (B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
15 the public interest, a court:
16 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
17 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
18 findings with respect to both.
19 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
20 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
21 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
22 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
23 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
24 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court

6 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
7 and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
8 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
9 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
10 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
11 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
12 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
13 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
14 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
15 (f) Attorney fees or costs may not be awarded to the prevailing party in an action alleging
16 noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3.
17 (7) (6) For the purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
18 inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
19 to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
20 that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding
21 pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
22 (8) (7) The director of the agency responsible for the determination or recommendation shall endorse
23 in writing any determination of significance made under subsection (1)(b)(iv) (1)(a)(iv) or any recommendation
24 that a determination of significance be made.

5 A BILL FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: “AN ACT GENERALLY REVISING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS RELATED TO
6 THE POLICY, PURPOSE, INTENT, VENUE, PROCEDURES, AND CONSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
7 OF THE MONTANA ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT; ELIMINATING CERTAIN LAWS ON POLICIES,
8 GOALS, CONSTITUTIONAL DETERMINATIONS, AND VENUES OF THE MONTANA ENVIRONMENTAL
9 POLICY ACT; ESTABLISHING THE REVISED POLICY, PURPOSE, AND INTENT OF THE ACT AND THE
10 PURPOSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS; REAFFIRMING EXISTING LAW THAT THE MONTANA
11 ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT IS PROCEDURAL; PROVIDING THAT A PLAINTIFF HAS THE BURDEN OF
12 ESTABLISHING THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE UNDERLYING STATUTE FOR LICENSING OR
13 PERMITTING DECISIONS OR ACTIVITIES UNDER TITLES 75 OR 82; PROVIDING THAT VENUE IN
14 DISTRICT COURT MUST BE IN THE COUNTY WHERE THE ACTIVITY SUBJECT TO THE PROCEEDING IS
15 PROPOSED TO OCCUR OR WILL OCCUR; AMENDING SECTIONS 5-16-102, 75-1-102, 75-1-104, 75-1-106,

19 WHEREAS, the Department of Environmental Quality convened a multidisciplinary work group to
20 review and recommend updates to the Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) during the summer of 2024.
21 That work group recommended that the Legislature confirm the importance of MEPA as a valuable data
22 gathering and analytical tool intended to provide sound and objective information to the public, agency
23 decisionmakers, and lawmakers as each strives to make fully informed decisions; and
24 WHEREAS, Article II, section 3, of the Montana Constitution enumerates inalienable rights, including
25 the right to a clean and healthful environment, rights to pursue life's basic necessities, rights to enjoy and
26 defend their lives and liberties, rights to acquire, possess, and protect property, and rights to seek safety,
27 health, and happiness in all lawful ways, and neither the Constitution nor the Legislature through the passage of
28 MEPA has identified a prioritization of one right over any other. As such, MEPA requires a balanced view of
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – HB 285

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0285.2
1 competing social, economic, and environmental goals and potential impacts in order to promote the overall
2 health, safety, and welfare of Montanans; and
3 WHEREAS, the Legislature and the Supreme Court are in agreement that MEPA is purely procedural
4 in nature and intended to foster more informed decisionmaking on state actions, and that the process is
5 intended to provide a transparent public forum in which to analyze and disclose potential significant impacts to
6 Montana's environment and to provide a clearer understanding of the rationale behind state permitting
7 decisions; and
8 WHEREAS, the Legislature has made the act's intent clear in "A Guide to the Montana Environmental
9 Policy Act," which states that "MEPA is not an act that controls or sets regulations for any specific land or
10 resource use. It is not a preservation, wilderness, or antidevelopment act. It is not a device for preventing
11 industrial or agricultural development. If implemented correctly and efficiently, MEPA should encourage and
12 foster economic development that is environmentally and socially sound. By taking the time to identify the
13 environmental impacts of a state decision before the decision is made and including the public in the process,
14 MEPA is intended to foster better decisionmaking for people and the environment"; and
15 WHEREAS, the permissibility of environmental impacts is not determined by MEPA, but through
16 compliance with standards and criteria adopted under the authority granted by the Legislature in substantive
17 environmental statutes. As such, MEPA is not intended to force, hinder, or preclude particular outcomes or
18 decisions, and the statute has no independent regulatory authority, and no means to withhold, deny, or modify
19 permits independently administered under Montana's substantive environmental regulations; and
20 WHEREAS, Article IX, section 1, of the Montana Constitution clearly assigns the Legislature with the
21 responsibility to administer and enforce a system of laws to protect the environment against unreasonable
22 degradation, and the Legislature has duly enacted substantive statutes to provide these environmental
23 protections. The following statutes and attending rules establish requirements for predictive analysis to satisfy
24 the "anticipatory and preventative" test established by the Supreme Court:
25 Montana Clean Indoor Air Act of 1979, Title 50, chapter 40, part 1;
26 Clean Air Act of Montana, Title 75, chapter 2, parts 1 through 4;
27 Water Quality, Title 75, chapter 5;
28 The Natural Streambed and Land Preservation Act of 1975, Title 75, chapter 7, part 1;
- 2 - Authorized Print Version – HB 285

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0285.2
1 The Montana Solid Waste Management Act, Title 75, chapter 10, part 2;
2 Montana Hazardous Waste Act, Title 75, chapter 10, part 4;
3 Comprehensive Environmental Cleanup and Responsibility Act, Title 75, chapter 10, part 7;
4 Montana Underground Storage Tank Installer and Inspector Licensing and Permitting Act, Title 75,
5 chapter 11, part 2;
6 Montana Underground Storage Tank Act, Title 75, chapter 11, part 5;
7 Montana Major Facility Siting Act, Title 75, chapter 20;
8 Open-Space Land and Voluntary Conservation Easement Act, Title 76, chapter 6;
9 Environmental Control Easement Act, Title 76, chapter 7;
10 The Strip and Underground Mine Siting Act, Title 82, chapter 4, part 1;
11 The Montana Strip and Underground Mine Reclamation Act, Title 82, chapter 4, part 2;
12 The Opencut Mining Act, Title 82, chapter 4, part 4;
13 The Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act, Title 87, chapter 5, part 1;
14 Each of these independent statutes relies on scientific analysis and informed permitting decisions to anticipate,
15 avoid, minimize, or mitigate significant impacts to Montana's environment.
16 WHEREAS, in Bitterrooters for Planning, Inc. v. Montana Department of Environmental Quality, 2017
17 MT 222, 388 Mont. 453, 401 P.3d 712, the Supreme Court stated, "an agency action is a legal cause of an
18 environmental effect only if the agency can prevent the effect through the lawful exercise of its independent
19 authority"; therefore, a challenge brought under MEPA must be limited to deficiencies in analysis or disclosure
20 in areas where legislative direction has been provided to agencies through substantive environmental statutes;
21 and
22 WHEREAS, the 69th Legislature affirms the intent of the 42nd Legislature, which expressed the
23 following statements and positions while passing MEPA into law in 1971: "A major conservation challenge
24 today is to achieve needed development and use of our natural resources while concurrently protecting and
25 enhancing the quality of our environment. MEPA seeks that often elusive middle ground between purely
26 preservationist philosophy and purely exploitive philosophy, and indeed we must soon find that middle ground.
27 As we guide Montana's development, we must use scientific, technological, and sociological expertise."

2 before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the decision or the adequacy of the agency's environmental
3 review.
4 (ii) If upon on reviewing the affidavit the court finds that the proffered information is new, material,
5 and significant evidence that was not publicly available before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the
6 decision or to the adequacy of the agency's environmental review, the court shall remand the new evidence to
7 the agency for the agency's consideration and an opportunity to modify its decision or environmental review
8 before the court considers the evidence as a part of the administrative record under review.
9 (iii) If the court finds that the information in the affidavit does not meet the requirements of

12 (c) (i) The remedies provided in this section for successful challenges to a decision of the agency
13 or the adequacy of the statement are exclusive.
14 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-19-201 and 27-19-314, a court having considered the
15 pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
16 injunction, permanent injunction, or other equitable relief may not enjoin the issuance or effectiveness of a
17 license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court
18 specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not to prevail on the merits of its
19 complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in the absence of a temporary
20 restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or other equitable relief, that the:
21 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
22 (B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
23 the public interest, a court:
24 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
25 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
26 findings with respect to both.
27 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
28 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – HB 285

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0285.2
1 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
2 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
3 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
4 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
5 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
6 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
7 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
8 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking
9 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
10 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
11 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
12 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
13 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
14 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
15 and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
16 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
17 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
18 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
19 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
20 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
21 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
22 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
23 (f) Attorney fees or costs may not be awarded to the prevailing party in an action alleging
24 noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3.
25 (7)(5) For the purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
26 inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
27 to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
28 that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding

14 Bill No. 221]. The department of environmental quality shall develop a guidance document for use by state
15 agencies to determine when a greenhouse gas assessment may be necessary. The guidance must include
16 direction on methodologies for completing a greenhouse gas assessment. Prior to finalizing this guidance, the
17 department shall provide public notice of the draft guidance and allow for public comment.
18 (b) An environmental review conducted pursuant to subsection (1) may include an evaluation of
19 the reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of a proposed action if:
20
21 (i) conducted jointly by a state agency and a federal agency to the extent the review of the
22 expanded assessment is required by the federal agency; or
23 (ii) the United States congress amends the federal Clean Air Act to include carbon dioxide
24 emissions as a regulated pollutant.
25 (3) The department of public service regulation, in the exercise of its regulatory authority over rates
26 and charges of railroads, motor carriers, and public utilities, is exempt from the provisions of parts 1 through 3.
27 (4) (a) The agency may not withhold, deny, or impose conditions on any permit or other authority
28 to act based on parts 1 through 3 of this chapter.

1 (b) Nothing in this subsection (4) prevents a project sponsor and an agency from mutually
2 developing measures that may, at the request of a project sponsor, be incorporated into a permit or other
3 authority to act.
4 (c) Parts 1 through 3 of this chapter do not confer authority to an agency that is a project sponsor
5 to modify a proposed project or action.
6 (5) (4) (a) (i) A challenge to an agency's environmental review under this part may only be brought
7 against a final agency action state action approved in a final decision document and may only be brought in
8 district court or in federal court, whichever is appropriate. A challenge may only be brought by a person who
9 submits formal comments on the agency's environmental review prior to the issuance of the agency's final
10 decision document, and the challenge must be limited to those issues addressed raised in those comments.
11 (ii) Any action or proceeding challenging a final agency action state action approved in a final
12 decision document alleging failure to comply with or inadequate compliance with a requirement under this part
13 must be brought within 60 days of the action that is the subject of the challenge.
14 (iii) For an action taken by the board of land commissioners or the department of natural resources
15 and conservation under Title 77, "final agency action" means the date that the board of land commissioners or
16 the department of natural resources and conservation issues a final environmental review document under this
17 part or the date that the board approves the action that is subject to this part, whichever is later.
18 (b) Any action or proceeding under subsection (5)(a)(ii) (4)(a)(ii) must take precedence over other
19 cases or matters in the district court unless otherwise provided by law.
20 (c) Any judicial action or proceeding brought in district court under subsection (5)(a) (4)(a)
21 involving an equine slaughter or processing facility must comply with 81-9-240 and 81-9-241.
22 (6) (5) (a) (i) In an action alleging noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of
23 parts 1 through 3, including a challenge to an agency's decision that an environmental review is not required or
24 a claim that the environmental review is inadequate, the agency shall compile and submit to the court the
25 certified record of its decision at issue. The agency, prior to submitting the certified record to the court, shall
26 assess and collect from the person challenging the decision a fee to pay for actual costs to compile and submit
27 the certified record. Except as provided in subsection (6)(b) (5)(b), the person challenging the decision has the
28 burden of proving the claim by clear and convincing evidence contained in the record.

1 (ii) An action alleging noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1
2 through 3, including a challenge to an agency's decision that an environmental review is not required or a claim
3 that the environmental review is inadequate based in whole or in part upon greenhouse gas emissions and
4 impacts to the climate in Montana or beyond Montana's borders, cannot vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit,
5 license, certificate, authorization, or other entitlement or authority unless the review is required by a federal
6 agency or the United States congress amends the federal Clean Air Act to include carbon dioxide as a
7 regulated pollutant.
8 (iii) (ii) Except as provided in subsection (6)(b) (5)(b), in a challenge to the agency's decision or the
9 adequacy of an environmental review, a court may not consider any information, including but not limited to an
10 issue, comment, argument, proposed alternative, analysis, or evidence, that was not first presented to the
11 agency for the agency's consideration prior to the agency's decision or within the time allowed for comments to
12 be submitted.
13 (iv) (iii) Except as provided in subsection (6)(b) (5)(b), the court shall confine its review to the record
14 certified by the agency. The court shall affirm the agency's decision or the environmental review unless the
15 court specifically finds that the agency's decision was arbitrary and capricious.
16 (v) (iv) A customer fiscal impact analysis pursuant to 69-2-216 or an allegation that the customer fiscal
17 impact analysis is inadequate may not be used as the basis of an action challenging or seeking review of the
18 agency's decision.
19 (b) (i) When a party challenging the decision or the adequacy of the environmental review or
20 decision presents information not in the record certified by the agency, the challenging party shall certify under
21 oath in an affidavit that the information is new, material, and significant evidence that was not publicly available
22 before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the decision or the adequacy of the agency's environmental
23 review.
24 (ii) If upon on reviewing the affidavit the court finds that the proffered information is new, material,
25 and significant evidence that was not publicly available before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the
26 decision or to the adequacy of the agency's environmental review, the court shall remand the new evidence to
27 the agency for the agency's consideration and an opportunity to modify its decision or environmental review
28 before the court considers the evidence as a part of the administrative record under review.

1 (iii) If the court finds that the information in the affidavit does not meet the requirements of
2 subsection (6)(b)(i) (5)(b)(i), the court may not remand the matter to the agency or consider the proffered
3 information in making its decision.
4 (c) (i) The remedies provided in this section for successful challenges to a decision of the agency
5 or the adequacy of the statement are exclusive.
6 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-19-201 and 27-19-314, a court having considered the
7 pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
8 injunction, permanent injunction, or other equitable relief may not enjoin the issuance or effectiveness of a
9 license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court
10 specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not to prevail on the merits of its
11 complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in the absence of a temporary
12 restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or other equitable relief, that the:
13 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
14 (B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
15 the public interest, a court:
16 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
17 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
18 findings with respect to both.
19 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
20 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
21 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
22 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
23 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
24 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
25 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
26 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
27 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
28 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB0285.2
1 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
2 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
3 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
4 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
5 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
6 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
7 and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
8 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
9 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
10 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
11 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
12 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
13 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
14 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
15 (f) Attorney fees or costs may not be awarded to the prevailing party in an action alleging
16 noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3.
17 (7) (6) For the purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
18 inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
19 to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
20 that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding
21 pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
22 (8) (7) The director of the agency responsible for the determination or recommendation shall endorse
23 in writing any determination of significance made under subsection (1)(b)(iv) (1)(a)(iv) or any recommendation
24 that a determination of significance be made.
25 (9) (8) A project sponsor may request a review of the significance determination or recommendation
26 made under subsection (8) (7) by the appropriate board, if any. The appropriate board may, at its discretion,
27 submit an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue. The period of time between the request
28 for a review and completion of a review under this subsection may not be included for the purposes of
