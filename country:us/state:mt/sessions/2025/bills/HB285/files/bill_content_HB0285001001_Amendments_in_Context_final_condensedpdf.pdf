19 WHEREAS, the Department of Environmental Quality convened a multidisciplinary work group to
20 review and recommend updates to the Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) during the summer of 2024.
21 That work group recommended that the Legislature confirm the importance of MEPA as a valuable data
22 gathering and analytical tool intended to provide sound and objective information to the public, agency
23 decisionmakers, and lawmakers as each strives to make fully informed decisions; and
24 WHEREAS, Article II, section 3, of the Montana Constitution enumerates inalienable rights, including
25 the right to a clean and healthful environment, rights to pursue life's basic necessities, rights to enjoy and
26 defend their lives and liberties, rights to acquire, possess, and protect property, and rights to seek safety,
27 health, and happiness in all lawful ways, and neither the Constitution nor the Legislature through the passage of
28 MEPA has identified a prioritization of one right over any other. As such, MEPA requires a balanced view of

10 and describe appropriate alternatives to recommend courses of action in any proposal that involves unresolved
11 conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources. If the alternatives analysis is conducted for a
12 project that is not a state-sponsored project and alternatives are recommended, the project sponsor may
13 volunteer to implement the alternative. Neither theThe alternatives analysis nor or the resulting
14 recommendations may not bind the project sponsor to take a recommended course of action, but the project
15 sponsor may agree pursuant to subsection (4)(b) to a specific course of action.
16 (vi) recognize the potential long-range character of environmental impacts in Montana and, when

16 department shall provide public notice of the draft guidance and allow for public comment.
17 (b) An environmental review conducted pursuant to subsection (1) may include an evaluation of
18 the reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of a proposed action if:
19 (i) conducted jointly by a state agency and a federal agency to the extent the review of the
20 expanded assessment is required by the federal agency; or
21 (ii) the United States congress amends the federal Clean Air Act to include carbon dioxide
22 emissions as a regulated pollutant.

5 against a final agency action state action approved in a final decision document and may only be brought in
6 district court or in federal court, whichever is appropriate. A challenge may only be brought by a person who
7 submits formal comments on the agency's environmental review prior to the issuance of the agency's final
8 decision document, and the challenge must be limited to those issues addressed raised in those comments.
9 (ii) Any action or proceeding challenging a final agency action state action approved in a final
10 decision document alleging failure to comply with or inadequate compliance with a requirement under this part
11 must be brought within 60 days of the action that is the subject of the challenge.

23 certified record of its decision at issue. The agency, prior to submitting the certified record to the court, shall
24 assess and collect from the person challenging the decision a fee to pay for actual costs to compile and submit
25 the certified record. Except as provided in subsection (6)(b)(5)(b), the person challenging the decision has the
26 burden of proving the claim by clear and convincing evidence contained in the record.

1 that the environmental review is inadequate based in whole or in part upon greenhouse gas emissions and
2 impacts to the climate in Montana or beyond Montana's borders, cannot vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit,
3 license, certificate, authorization, or other entitlement or authority unless the review is required by a federal
4 agency or the United States congress amends the federal Clean Air Act to include carbon dioxide as a
5 regulated pollutant.
6 (iii)(ii) Except as provided in subsection (6)(b)(5)(b), in a challenge to the agency's decision or the
7 adequacy of an environmental review, a court may not consider any information, including but not limited to an
8 issue, comment, argument, proposed alternative, analysis, or evidence, that was not first presented to the
9 agency for the agency's consideration prior to the agency's decision or within the time allowed for comments to
10 be submitted.
11 (iv)(iii) Except as provided in subsection (6)(b)(5)(b), the court shall confine its review to the record
12 certified by the agency. The court shall affirm the agency's decision or the environmental review unless the
13 court specifically finds that the agency's decision was arbitrary and capricious.
14 (v)(iv) A customer fiscal impact analysis pursuant to 69-2-216 or an allegation that the customer fiscal
15 impact analysis is inadequate may not be used as the basis of an action challenging or seeking review of the
16 agency's decision.
17 (b) (i) When a party challenging the decision or the adequacy of the environmental review or
18 decision presents information not in the record certified by the agency, the challenging party shall certify under
19 oath in an affidavit that the information is new, material, and significant evidence that was not publicly available
20 before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the decision or the adequacy of the agency's environmental
21 review.
22 (ii) If upon on reviewing the affidavit the court finds that the proffered information is new, material,
23 and significant evidence that was not publicly available before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the
24 decision or to the adequacy of the agency's environmental review, the court shall remand the new evidence to
25 the agency for the agency's consideration and an opportunity to modify its decision or environmental review
26 before the court considers the evidence as a part of the administrative record under review.
27 (iii) If the court finds that the information in the affidavit does not meet the requirements of
28 subsection (6)(b)(i)(5)(b)(i), the court may not remand the matter to the agency or consider the proffered

1 information in making its decision.
2 (c) (i) The remedies provided in this section for successful challenges to a decision of the agency
3 or the adequacy of the statement are exclusive.
4 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-19-201 and 27-19-314, a court having considered the
5 pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
6 injunction, permanent injunction, or other equitable relief may not enjoin the issuance or effectiveness of a
7 license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court
8 specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not to prevail on the merits of its
9 complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in the absence of a temporary
10 restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or other equitable relief, that the:
11 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
12 (B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
13 the public interest, a court:
14 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
15 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
16 findings with respect to both.
17 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
18 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
19 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
20 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
21 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
22 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
23 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
24 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
25 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
26 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking
27 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
28 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
- 24 - Authorized Print Version – HB 285

Amendment - 1st Reading/2nd House-blue - Requested by: (S) Natural Resources
- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 Drafter: Jason Mohr, HB0285.001.001
1 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
2 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
3 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
4 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
5 and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
6 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
7 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
8 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
9 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
10 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
11 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
12 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
13 (f) Attorney fees or costs may not be awarded to the prevailing party in an action alleging
14 noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3.
15 (7)(6) For the purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
16 inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
17 to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
18 that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding
19 pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
20 (8)(7) The director of the agency responsible for the determination or recommendation shall endorse
21 in writing any determination of significance made under subsection (1)(b)(iv) (1)(a)(iv) or any recommendation
22 that a determination of significance be made.
23 (9)(8) A project sponsor may request a review of the significance determination or recommendation
24 made under subsection (8)(7) by the appropriate board, if any. The appropriate board may, at its discretion,
25 submit an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue. The period of time between the request
26 for a review and completion of a review under this subsection may not be included for the purposes of
27 determining compliance with the time limits established for environmental review in 75-1-208."
