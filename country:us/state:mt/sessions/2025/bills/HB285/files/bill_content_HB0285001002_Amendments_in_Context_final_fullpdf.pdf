19 WHEREAS, the Department of Environmental Quality convened a multidisciplinary work group to
20 review and recommend updates to the Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) during the summer of 2024.
21 That work group recommended that the Legislature confirm the importance of MEPA as a valuable data
22 gathering and analytical tool intended to provide sound and objective information to the public, agency
23 decisionmakers, and lawmakers as each strives to make fully informed decisions; and
24 WHEREAS, Article II, section 3, of the Montana Constitution enumerates inalienable rights, including
25 the right to a clean and healthful environment, rights to pursue life's basic necessities, rights to enjoy and
26 defend their lives and liberties, rights to acquire, possess, and protect property, and rights to seek safety,
27 health, and happiness in all lawful ways, and neither the Constitution nor the Legislature through the passage of

1 MEPA has identified a prioritization of one right over any other. As such, MEPA requires a balanced view of
2 competing social, economic, and environmental goals and potential impacts in order to promote the overall
3 health, safety, and welfare of Montanans; and
4 WHEREAS, the Legislature and the Supreme Court are in agreement that MEPA is purely procedural
5 in nature and intended to foster more informed decisionmaking on state actions, and that the process is
6 intended to provide a transparent public forum in which to analyze and disclose potential significant impacts to
7 Montana's environment and to provide a clearer understanding of the rationale behind state permitting
8 decisions; and
9 WHEREAS, the Legislature has made the act's intent clear in "A Guide to the Montana Environmental
10 Policy Act," which states that "MEPA is not an act that controls or sets regulations for any specific land or
11 resource use. It is not a preservation, wilderness, or antidevelopment act. It is not a device for preventing
12 industrial or agricultural development. If implemented correctly and efficiently, MEPA should encourage and
13 foster economic development that is environmentally and socially sound. By taking the time to identify the
14 environmental impacts of a state decision before the decision is made and including the public in the process,
15 MEPA is intended to foster better decisionmaking for people and the environment"; and
16 WHEREAS, the permissibility of environmental impacts is not determined by MEPA, but through
17 compliance with standards and criteria adopted under the authority granted by the Legislature in substantive
18 environmental statutes. As such, MEPA is not intended to force, hinder, or preclude particular outcomes or
19 decisions, and the statute has no independent regulatory authority, and no means to withhold, deny, or modify
20 permits independently administered under Montana's substantive environmental regulations; and
21 WHEREAS, Article IX, section 1, of the Montana Constitution clearly assigns the Legislature with the
22 responsibility to administer and enforce a system of laws to protect the environment against unreasonable
23 degradation, and the Legislature has duly enacted substantive statutes to provide these environmental
24 protections. The following statutes and attending rules establish requirements for predictive analysis to satisfy
25 the "anticipatory and preventative" test established by the Supreme Court:
26 Montana Clean Indoor Air Act of 1979, Title 50, chapter 40, part 1;
27 Clean Air Act of Montana, Title 75, chapter 2, parts 1 through 4;

16 Each of these independent statutes relies on scientific analysis and informed permitting decisions to anticipate,
17 avoid, minimize, or mitigate significant impacts to Montana's environment.
18 WHEREAS, in Bitterrooters for Planning, Inc. v. Montana Department of Environmental Quality, 2017
19 MT 222, 388 Mont. 453, 401 P.3d 712, the Supreme Court stated, "an agency action is a legal cause of an
20 environmental effect only if the agency can prevent the effect through the lawful exercise of its independent
21 authority"; therefore, a challenge brought under MEPA must be limited to deficiencies in analysis or disclosure
22 in areas where legislative direction has been provided to agencies through substantive environmental statutes;
23 and
24 WHEREAS, the 69th Legislature affirms the intent of the 42nd Legislature, which expressed the
25 following statements and positions while passing MEPA into law in 1971: "A major conservation challenge
26 today is to achieve needed development and use of our natural resources while concurrently protecting and
27 enhancing the quality of our environment. MEPA seeks that often elusive middle ground between purely

1 preservationist philosophy and purely exploitive philosophy, and indeed we must soon find that middle ground.

21 subsection (6)(b)(i) (4)(b)(i), the court may not remand the matter to the agency or consider the proffered
22 information in making its decision.
23 (c) (i) The remedies provided in this section for successful challenges to a decision of the agency
24 or the adequacy of the statement are exclusive.
25 (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-19-201 and 27-19-314, a court having considered the
26 pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
27 injunction, permanent injunction, or other equitable relief may not enjoin the issuance or effectiveness of a

1 license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court
2 specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not to prevail on the merits of its
3 complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in the absence of a temporary
4 restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or other equitable relief, that the:
5 (A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
6 (B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
7 the public interest, a court:
8 (I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
9 (II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
10 findings with respect to both.
11 (C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
12 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
13 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
14 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
15 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
16 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
17 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
18 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
19 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
20 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking
21 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
22 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
23 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
24 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
25 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
26 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
27 and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:

1 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
2 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
3 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
4 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
5 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
6 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
7 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
8 (f) Attorney fees or costs may not be awarded to the prevailing party in an action alleging
9 noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3.
10 (7)(5) For the purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
11 inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
12 to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
13 that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding
14 pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
15 (8)(6) The director of the agency responsible for the determination or recommendation shall endorse
16 in writing any determination of significance made under subsection (1)(b)(iv) (1)(a)(iv) or any recommendation
17 that a determination of significance be made.
18 (9)(7) A project sponsor may request a review of the significance determination or recommendation
19 made under subsection (8) (6) by the appropriate board, if any. The appropriate board may, at its discretion,
20 submit an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue. The period of time between the request
21 for a review and completion of a review under this subsection may not be included for the purposes of
22 determining compliance with the time limits established for environmental review in 75-1-208."

1 (b) To the extent that the requirements of this section are inconsistent with federal requirements,
2 the requirements of this section do not apply to an environmental review that is being prepared jointly by a state
3 agency pursuant to this part and a federal agency pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act or to an
4 environmental review that must comply with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.
5 (2) (a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), a project sponsor may, after providing a 30-day
6 notice, appear before the environmental quality council at any regularly scheduled meeting to discuss issues
7 regarding the agency's environmental review of the project. The environmental quality council shall ensure that
8 the appropriate agency personnel are available to answer questions.
9 (b) If the primary concern of the agency's environmental review of a project is the quality or
10 quantity of water, a project sponsor may, after providing a 30-day notice, appear before the water policy
11 committee established in 5-5-231 at any regularly scheduled meeting to discuss issues regarding the agency's
12 environmental review of the project. The water policy committee shall ensure that the appropriate agency
13 personnel are available to answer questions.
14 (3) If a project sponsor experiences problems in dealing with the agency or any consultant hired by
15 the agency regarding an environmental review, the project sponsor may submit a written request to the agency
16 director requesting a meeting to discuss the issues. The written request must sufficiently state the issues to
17 allow the agency to prepare for the meeting. If the issues remain unresolved after the meeting with the agency
18 director, the project sponsor may submit a written request to appear before the appropriate board, if any, to
19 discuss the remaining issues. A written request to the appropriate board must sufficiently state the issues to
20 allow the agency and the board to prepare for the meeting.
21 (4) (a) Subject to the requirements of subsection (5), to ensure a timely completion of the
22 environmental review process, an agency is subject to the time limits listed in this subsection (4) unless other
23 time limits are provided by law. All time limits are measured from the date the agency receives a complete
24 application. An agency has:
25 (i) 60 days to complete a public scoping process, if any;
26 (ii) 90 days to complete an environmental review unless a detailed statement pursuant to 75-1-

1 (iii) 180 days to complete a detailed statement pursuant to 75-1-201(1)(b)(iv) 75-1-201(1)(a)(iv).
2 (b) The period of time between the request for a review by a board and the completion of a review
3 by a board under 75-1-201(9) 75-1-201(7) or subsection (10) of this section may not be included for the
4 purposes of determining compliance with the time limits established for conducting an environmental review
5 under this subsection or the time limits established for permitting in 75-2-211, 75-2-218, 75-20-216, 75-20-231,
6 76-4-114, 82-4-122, 82-4-231, 82-4-337, and 82-4-432.
7 (5) An agency may extend the time limits in subsection (4) by notifying the project sponsor in
8 writing that an extension is necessary and stating the basis for the extension. The agency may extend the time
9 limit one time, and the extension may not exceed 50% of the original time period as listed in subsection (4).
10 After one extension, the agency may not extend the time limit unless the agency and the project sponsor
11 mutually agree to the extension.
12 (6) If the project sponsor disagrees with the need for the extension, the project sponsor may
13 request that the appropriate board, if any, conduct a review of the agency's decision to extend the time period.
14 The appropriate board may, at its discretion, submit an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the
15 issue.
16 (7) (a) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), if an agency has not completed the environmental
17 review by the expiration of the original or extended time period, the agency may not withhold a permit or other
18 authority to act unless the agency makes a written finding that there is a likelihood that permit issuance or other
19 approval to act would result in the violation of a statutory or regulatory requirement.
20 (b) Subsection (7)(a) does not apply to a permit granted under Title 75, chapter 2, or under Title
21 82, chapter 4, parts 1 and 2.

23 relevant to the environmental review required under this part.
24 (9) An agency shall ensure that the notification for any public scoping process associated with an
25 environmental review conducted by the agency is presented in an objective and neutral manner and that the
26 notification does not speculate on the potential impacts of the project.

2 appropriate board, if any, review an agency's request regarding the level of design detail information that the
3 agency believes is necessary to conduct the environmental review. The appropriate board may, at its
4 discretion, submit an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue.
5 (11) An agency shall, when appropriate, evaluate the cumulative impacts of a proposed project.
