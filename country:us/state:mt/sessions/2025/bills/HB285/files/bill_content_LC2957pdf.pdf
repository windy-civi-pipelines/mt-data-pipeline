18 WHEREAS, the Department of Environmental Quality convened a MULTIDISCIPLINARY work group to
19 review and recommend updates to the Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) during the summer of 2024.
20 That work group recommended that the Legislature confirm the importance of MEPA as a valuable data
21 gathering and analytical tool intended to provide sound and objective information to the public, agency
22 DECISIONMAKERS, and lawmakers as each strives to make fully informed decisions; and
23 WHEREAS, Article II, section 3, of the Montana Constitution enumerates inalienable rights, including
24 the right to a clean and healthful environment, rights to pursue life's basic necessities, rights to enjoy and
25 defend their lives and liberties, rights to acquire, possess, and protect property, and rights to seek safety,
26 health, and happiness in all lawful ways, and neither the Constitution nor the Legislature through the passage of
27 MEPA has identified a prioritization of one right over any other. As such, MEPA requires a balanced view of
28 competing social, economic, and environmental goals and potential impacts in order to promote the overall
- 1 - LC 2957

****
69th Legislature 2025 LC 2957
1 health, safety, and welfare of Montanans; and
2 WHEREAS, the Legislature and the Supreme Court are in agreement that MEPA is purely procedural
3 in nature and intended to foster more informed DECISIONMAKING on state actions, and that the process is
4 intended to provide a transparent public forum in which to analyze and disclose potential significant impacts to
5 Montana's environment and to provide a clearer understanding of the rationale behind state permitting
6 decisions; and
7 WHEREAS, the Legislature has made the act's intent clear in "A Guide to the Montana Environmental
8 Policy Act," which states that "MEPA is not an act that controls or sets regulations for any specific land or
9 resource use. It is not a preservation, wilderness, or antidevelopment act. It is not a device for preventing
10 industrial or agricultural development. If implemented correctly and efficiently, MEPA should encourage and
11 foster economic development that is environmentally and socially sound. By taking the time to identify the
12 environmental impacts of a state decision before the decision is made and including the public in the process,
13 MEPA is intended to foster better decisionmaking for people and the environment"; and
14 WHEREAS, the permissibility of environmental impacts is not determined by MEPA, but through
15 compliance with standards and criteria adopted under the authority granted by the LEGISLATURE in substantive
16 environmental statutes. As such, MEPA is not intended to force, hinder, or preclude particular outcomes or
17 decisions, and the statute has no independent regulatory authority, and no means to withhold, deny, or modify
18 permits independently administered under Montana's substantive environmental regulations; and
19 WHEREAS, Article IX, section 1, of the Montana Constitution clearly assigns the Legislature with the
20 responsibility to administer and enforce a system of laws to protect the environment against unreasonable
21 degradation, and the Legislature has duly enacted substantive statutes to provide THESE environmental
22 protections. The following statutes and attending rules establish requirements for predictive analysis to satisfy
23 the "anticipatory and preventative" test established by the Supreme Court:
24 Montana Clean Indoor Air Act of 1979, Title 50, chapter 40, part 1;
25 Clean Air Act of Montana, Title 75, chapter 2, parts 1 through 4;
26 Water Quality, Title 75, chapter 5;
27 The Natural Streambed and Land Preservation Act of 1975, Title 75, chapter 7, part 1;
28 The Montana Solid Waste Management Act, Title 75, chapter 10, part 2;

1 Montana Hazardous Waste Act, Title 75, chapter 10, part 4;
2 Comprehensive Environmental Cleanup and Responsibility Act, Title 75, chapter 10, part 7;
3 Montana Underground Storage Tank Installer and Inspector Licensing and Permitting Act, Title 75,
4 chapter 11, part 2;
5 Montana Underground Storage Tank Act, Title 75, chapter 11, part 5;
6 Montana Major Facility Siting Act, Title 75, chapter 20;

10 The Montana Strip and Underground Mine Reclamation Act, Title 82, chapter 4, part 2;
11 The Opencut Mining Act, Title 82, chapter 4, part 4;
12 The Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act, Title 87, chapter 5, part 1;
13 Each of these independent statutes relies on scientific analysis and informed permitting decisions to anticipate,
14 avoid, minimize, or mitigate significant impacts to Montana's environment.
15 WHEREAS, in Bitterrooters for Planning, Inc. v. Montana Department of Environmental Quality, 2017
16 MT 222, 388 Mont. 453, 401 P.3d 712, the Supreme Court stated, "an agency action is a legal cause of an
17 environmental effect only if the agency can prevent the effect through the lawful exercise of its independent
18 authority"; therefore, a challenge brought under MEPA must be limited to deficiencies in analysis or disclosure
19 in areas where legislative direction has been provided to agencies through substantive environmental statutes;
20 and
21 WHEREAS, the 69th Legislature affirms the intent of the 42nd Legislature, which expressed the
22 following statements and positions while passing MEPA into law in 1971: "A major conservation challenge
23 today is to achieve needed development and use of our natural resources while concurrently protecting and
24 enhancing the quality of our environment. MEPA seeks that often elusive middle ground between purely
25 preservationist philosophy and purely exploitive philosophy, and indeed we must soon find that middle ground.
26 As we guide Montana's development, we must use scientific, technological, and sociological expertise."

15 injunction, permanent injunction, or other equitable relief may not enjoin the issuance or effectiveness of a
16 license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court

27 the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
28 extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the

1 relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
2 (d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
3 injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
4 in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
5 party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
6 decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
7 the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking
8 for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
9 court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
10 amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
11 challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
12 vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
13 initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
14 and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
15 (i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
16 (ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
17 license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
18 (iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
19 (e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
20 authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
21 agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
22 (f) Attorney fees or costs may not be awarded to the prevailing party in an action alleging
23 noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3.
24 (5) For the purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
25 inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
26 to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
27 that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding
28 pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.

3 approval to act would result in the violation of a statutory or regulatory requirement.
4 (b) Subsection (7)(a) does not apply to a permit granted under Title 75, chapter 2, or under Title
5 82, chapter 4, parts 1 and 2.

12 than that necessary to fairly evaluate the proposed project. The project sponsor may request that the
13 appropriate board, if any, review an agency's request regarding the level of design detail information that the
14 agency believes is necessary to conduct the environmental review. The appropriate board may, at its
15 discretion, submit an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue.
16 (11) An agency shall, when appropriate, evaluate the cumulative impacts of a proposed project.
