INTENT, VENUE, PROCEDURES, AND CONSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS OF THE MONTANA
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT; ELIMINATING CERTAIN LAWS ON POLICIES, GOALS,
CONSTITUTIONAL DETERMINATIONS, AND VENUES OF THE MONTANA ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
ACT; ESTABLISHING THE REVISED POLICY, PURPOSE, AND INTENT OF THE ACT AND THE PURPOSE
OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS; REAFFIRMING EXISTING LAW THAT THE MONTANA
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT IS PROCEDURAL; PROVIDING THAT A PLAINTIFF HAS THE BURDEN OF
ESTABLISHING THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE UNDERLYING STATUTE FOR LICENSING OR
PERMITTING DECISIONS OR ACTIVITIES UNDER TITLES 75 OR 82; PROVIDING THAT VENUE IN
DISTRICT COURT MUST BE IN THE COUNTY WHERE THE ACTIVITY SUBJECT TO THE PROCEEDING IS
PROPOSED TO OCCUR OR WILL OCCUR; AMENDING SECTIONS 5-16-102, 75-1-102, 75-1-104, 75-1-106,
75-1-201, 75-1-208, AND 75-1-324, MCA; REPEALING SECTIONS 75-1-103, 75-1-105, 75-1-107, AND 75-1-
108, MCA; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE DATE.”
WHEREAS, the Department of Environmental Quality convened a multidisciplinary work group to
review and recommend updates to the Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) during the summer of 2024.
That work group recommended that the Legislature confirm the importance of MEPA as a valuable data
gathering and analytical tool intended to provide sound and objective information to the public, agency
decisionmakers, and lawmakers as each strives to make fully informed decisions; and
WHEREAS, Article II, section 3, of the Montana Constitution enumerates inalienable rights, including
the right to a clean and healthful environment, rights to pursue life's basic necessities, rights to enjoy and
defend their lives and liberties, rights to acquire, possess, and protect property, and rights to seek safety,
health, and happiness in all lawful ways, and neither the Constitution nor the Legislature through the passage of
MEPA has identified a prioritization of one right over any other. As such, MEPA requires a balanced view of
- 1 - Authorized Print Version – HB 285
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 285
competing social, economic, and environmental goals and potential impacts in order to promote the overall
health, safety, and welfare of Montanans; and
WHEREAS, the Legislature and the Supreme Court are in agreement that MEPA is purely procedural
in nature and intended to foster more informed decisionmaking on state actions, and that the process is
intended to provide a transparent public forum in which to analyze and disclose potential significant impacts to
Montana's environment and to provide a clearer understanding of the rationale behind state permitting
decisions; and
WHEREAS, the Legislature has made the act's intent clear in "A Guide to the Montana Environmental
Policy Act," which states that "MEPA is not an act that controls or sets regulations for any specific land or
resource use. It is not a preservation, wilderness, or antidevelopment act. It is not a device for preventing
industrial or agricultural development. If implemented correctly and efficiently, MEPA should encourage and
foster economic development that is environmentally and socially sound. By taking the time to identify the
environmental impacts of a state decision before the decision is made and including the public in the process,
MEPA is intended to foster better decisionmaking for people and the environment"; and
WHEREAS, the permissibility of environmental impacts is not determined by MEPA, but through
compliance with standards and criteria adopted under the authority granted by the Legislature in substantive
environmental statutes. As such, MEPA is not intended to force, hinder, or preclude particular outcomes or
decisions, and the statute has no independent regulatory authority, and no means to withhold, deny, or modify
permits independently administered under Montana's substantive environmental regulations; and
WHEREAS, Article IX, section 1, of the Montana Constitution clearly assigns the Legislature with the
responsibility to administer and enforce a system of laws to protect the environment against unreasonable
degradation, and the Legislature has duly enacted substantive statutes to provide these environmental
protections. The following statutes and attending rules establish requirements for predictive analysis to satisfy
the "anticipatory and preventative" test established by the Supreme Court:
Montana Clean Indoor Air Act of 1979, Title 50, chapter 40, part 1;
Clean Air Act of Montana, Title 75, chapter 2, parts 1 through 4;
Water Quality, Title 75, chapter 5;
The Natural Streambed and Land Preservation Act of 1975, Title 75, chapter 7, part 1;

The Montana Solid Waste Management Act, Title 75, chapter 10, part 2;
Montana Hazardous Waste Act, Title 75, chapter 10, part 4;
Comprehensive Environmental Cleanup and Responsibility Act, Title 75, chapter 10, part 7;
Montana Underground Storage Tank Installer and Inspector Licensing and Permitting Act, Title 75,

Montana Underground Storage Tank Act, Title 75, chapter 11, part 5;
Montana Major Facility Siting Act, Title 75, chapter 20;
Open-Space Land and Voluntary Conservation Easement Act, Title 76, chapter 6;
Environmental Control Easement Act, Title 76, chapter 7;
The Strip and Underground Mine Siting Act, Title 82, chapter 4, part 1;
The Montana Strip and Underground Mine Reclamation Act, Title 82, chapter 4, part 2;
The Opencut Mining Act, Title 82, chapter 4, part 4;
The Nongame and Endangered Species Conservation Act, Title 87, chapter 5, part 1;
Each of these independent statutes relies on scientific analysis and informed permitting decisions to anticipate,
avoid, minimize, or mitigate significant impacts to Montana's environment.
WHEREAS, in Bitterrooters for Planning, Inc. v. Montana Department of Environmental Quality, 2017
MT 222, 388 Mont. 453, 401 P.3d 712, the Supreme Court stated, "an agency action is a legal cause of an
environmental effect only if the agency can prevent the effect through the lawful exercise of its independent
authority"; therefore, a challenge brought under MEPA must be limited to deficiencies in analysis or disclosure
in areas where legislative direction has been provided to agencies through substantive environmental statutes;
and
WHEREAS, the 69th Legislature affirms the intent of the 42nd Legislature, which expressed the
following statements and positions while passing MEPA into law in 1971: "A major conservation challenge
today is to achieve needed development and use of our natural resources while concurrently protecting and
enhancing the quality of our environment. MEPA seeks that often elusive middle ground between purely
preservationist philosophy and purely exploitive philosophy, and indeed we must soon find that middle ground.
As we guide Montana's development, we must use scientific, technological, and sociological expertise."

injunction, permanent injunction, or other equitable relief may not enjoin the issuance or effectiveness of a
license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court
specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not to prevail on the merits of its
complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in the absence of a temporary
restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or other equitable relief, that the:
(A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
(B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
the public interest, a court:
(I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
(II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
findings with respect to both.
(C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
- 12 - Authorized Print Version – HB 285
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 285
extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
(d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking
for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
(i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
(ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
(iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
(e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
(f) Attorney fees or costs may not be awarded to the prevailing party in an action alleging
noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3.
(7)(5) For the purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding

(8)(6) The director of the agency responsible for the determination or recommendation shall endorse
in writing any determination of significance made under subsection (1)(b)(iv) (1)(a)(iv) or any recommendation
that a determination of significance be made.
(9)(7) A project sponsor may request a review of the significance determination or recommendation
made under subsection (8) (6) by the appropriate board, if any. The appropriate board may, at its discretion,
submit an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue. The period of time between the request
for a review and completion of a review under this subsection may not be included for the purposes of
determining compliance with the time limits established for environmental review in 75-1-208."
Section 8. Section 75-1-208, MCA, is amended to read:
"75-1-208. Environmental review procedure. (1) (a) Except as provided in 75-1-205(4) and
subsection (1)(b) of this section, an agency shall comply with this section when completing any environmental
review required under this part.

the requirements of this section do not apply to an environmental review that is being prepared jointly by a state
agency pursuant to this part and a federal agency pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act or to an
environmental review that must comply with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.
(2) (a) Except as provided in subsection (2)(b), a project sponsor may, after providing a 30-day
notice, appear before the environmental quality council at any regularly scheduled meeting to discuss issues
regarding the agency's environmental review of the project. The environmental quality council shall ensure that
the appropriate agency personnel are available to answer questions.
(b) If the primary concern of the agency's environmental review of a project is the quality or
quantity of water, a project sponsor may, after providing a 30-day notice, appear before the water policy
committee established in 5-5-231 at any regularly scheduled meeting to discuss issues regarding the agency's
environmental review of the project. The water policy committee shall ensure that the appropriate agency
personnel are available to answer questions.

- 14 - Authorized Print Version – HB 285
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 285
the agency regarding an environmental review, the project sponsor may submit a written request to the agency
director requesting a meeting to discuss the issues. The written request must sufficiently state the issues to
allow the agency to prepare for the meeting. If the issues remain unresolved after the meeting with the agency
director, the project sponsor may submit a written request to appear before the appropriate board, if any, to
discuss the remaining issues. A written request to the appropriate board must sufficiently state the issues to
allow the agency and the board to prepare for the meeting.
(4) (a) Subject to the requirements of subsection (5), to ensure a timely completion of the
environmental review process, an agency is subject to the time limits listed in this subsection (4) unless other
time limits are provided by law. All time limits are measured from the date the agency receives a complete
application. An agency has:
(i) 60 days to complete a public scoping process, if any;
(ii) 90 days to complete an environmental review unless a detailed statement pursuant to 75-1-
201(1)(b)(iv) 75-1-201(1)(a)(iv) or 75-1-205(4) is required; and
(iii) 180 days to complete a detailed statement pursuant to 75-1-201(1)(b)(iv) 75-1-201(1)(a)(iv).
(b) The period of time between the request for a review by a board and the completion of a review
by a board under 75-1-201(9) 75-1-201(7) or subsection (10) of this section may not be included for the
purposes of determining compliance with the time limits established for conducting an environmental review
under this subsection or the time limits established for permitting in 75-2-211, 75-2-218, 75-20-216, 75-20-231,
76-4-114, 82-4-122, 82-4-231, 82-4-337, and 82-4-432.
(5) An agency may extend the time limits in subsection (4) by notifying the project sponsor in
writing that an extension is necessary and stating the basis for the extension. The agency may extend the time
limit one time, and the extension may not exceed 50% of the original time period as listed in subsection (4).
After one extension, the agency may not extend the time limit unless the agency and the project sponsor
mutually agree to the extension.
(6) If the project sponsor disagrees with the need for the extension, the project sponsor may
request that the appropriate board, if any, conduct a review of the agency's decision to extend the time period.
The appropriate board may, at its discretion, submit an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the
issue.

(7) (a) Except as provided in subsection (7)(b), if an agency has not completed the environmental
review by the expiration of the original or extended time period, the agency may not withhold a permit or other
authority to act unless the agency makes a written finding that there is a likelihood that permit issuance or other
approval to act would result in the violation of a statutory or regulatory requirement.
(b) Subsection (7)(a) does not apply to a permit granted under Title 75, chapter 2, or under Title
82, chapter 4, parts 1 and 2.
(8) Under this part, an agency may only request information from the project sponsor that is
relevant to the environmental review required under this part.
(9) An agency shall ensure that the notification for any public scoping process associated with an
environmental review conducted by the agency is presented in an objective and neutral manner and that the
notification does not speculate on the potential impacts of the project.
(10) An agency may not require the project sponsor to provide engineering designs in greater detail
than that necessary to fairly evaluate the proposed project. The project sponsor may request that the
appropriate board, if any, review an agency's request regarding the level of design detail information that the
agency believes is necessary to conduct the environmental review. The appropriate board may, at its
discretion, submit an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue.
(11) An agency shall, when appropriate, evaluate the cumulative impacts of a proposed project.
However, related future actions may only be considered when these actions are under concurrent consideration
by any agency through preimpact statement studies, separate impact statement evaluations, or permit
processing procedures."

adequacy of an environmental review, a court may not consider any information, including but not limited to an
issue, comment, argument, proposed alternative, analysis, or evidence, that was not first presented to the
agency for the agency's consideration prior to the agency's decision or within the time allowed for comments to
be submitted.
(iv)(iii) Except as provided in subsection (6)(b) (5)(b), the court shall confine its review to the record
certified by the agency. The court shall affirm the agency's decision or the environmental review unless the
court specifically finds that the agency's decision was arbitrary and capricious.
(v)(iv) A customer fiscal impact analysis pursuant to 69-2-216 or an allegation that the customer fiscal
impact analysis is inadequate may not be used as the basis of an action challenging or seeking review of the
agency's decision.
(b) (i) When a party challenging the decision or the adequacy of the environmental review or
decision presents information not in the record certified by the agency, the challenging party shall certify under
oath in an affidavit that the information is new, material, and significant evidence that was not publicly available
before the agency's decision and that is relevant to the decision or the adequacy of the agency's environmental
review.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of 27-19-201 and 27-19-314, a court having considered the
pleadings of parties and intervenors opposing a request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary
injunction, permanent injunction, or other equitable relief may not enjoin the issuance or effectiveness of a
license or permit or a part of a license or permit issued pursuant to Title 75 or Title 82 unless the court
specifically finds that the party requesting the relief is more likely than not to prevail on the merits of its
complaint given the uncontroverted facts in the record and applicable law and, in the absence of a temporary
restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or other equitable relief, that the:
(A) party requesting the relief will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the relief;
(B) issuance of the relief is in the public interest. In determining whether the grant of the relief is in
the public interest, a court:
(I) may not consider the legal nature or character of any party; and
(II) shall consider the implications of the relief on the local and state economy and make written
findings with respect to both.
(C) relief is as narrowly tailored as the facts allow to address both the alleged noncompliance and
the irreparable harm the party asking for the relief will suffer. In tailoring the relief, the court shall ensure, to the
extent possible, that the project or as much of the project as possible can go forward while also providing the
relief to which the applicant has been determined to be entitled.
(d) The court may issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent
injunction, or other injunctive relief only if the party seeking the relief provides a written undertaking to the court
in an amount reasonably calculated by the court as adequate to pay the costs and damages sustained by any
party that may be found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained by a court through a subsequent judicial
decision in the case, including but not limited to lost wages of employees and lost project revenues for 1 year. If
the party seeking an injunction or a temporary restraining order objects to the amount of the written undertaking
for any reason, including but not limited to its asserted inability to pay, that party shall file an affidavit with the
court that states the party's income, assets, and liabilities in order to facilitate the court's consideration of the
amount of the written undertaking that is required. The affidavit must be served on the party enjoined. If a
challenge for noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3 seeks to
- 24 - Authorized Print Version – HB 285
ENROLLED BILL

- 2025
69th Legislature 2025 HB 285
vacate, void, or delay a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority, the party shall, as an
initial matter, seek an injunction related to a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority,
and an injunction may only be issued if the challenger:
(i) proves there is a likelihood of succeeding on the merits;
(ii) proves there is a violation of an established law or regulation on which the lease, permit,
license, certificate, or other entitlement or authority is based; and
(iii) subject to the demonstration of the inability to pay, posts the appropriate written undertaking.
(e) An individual or entity seeking a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement or
authority to act may intervene in a lawsuit in court challenging a decision or statement by a department or
agency of the state as a matter of right if the individual or entity has not been named as a defendant.
(f) Attorney fees or costs may not be awarded to the prevailing party in an action alleging
noncompliance or inadequate compliance with a requirement of parts 1 through 3.
(7)(6) For the purposes of judicial review, to the extent that the requirements of this section are
inconsistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, the requirements of this section apply
to an environmental review or any severable portion of an environmental review within the state's jurisdiction
that is being prepared by a state agency pursuant to this part in conjunction with a federal agency proceeding
pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
(8)(7) The director of the agency responsible for the determination or recommendation shall endorse
in writing any determination of significance made under subsection (1)(b)(iv) (1)(a)(iv) or any recommendation
that a determination of significance be made.
(9)(8) A project sponsor may request a review of the significance determination or recommendation
made under subsection (8) (7) by the appropriate board, if any. The appropriate board may, at its discretion,
submit an advisory recommendation to the agency regarding the issue. The period of time between the request
for a review and completion of a review under this subsection may not be included for the purposes of
determining compliance with the time limits established for environmental review in 75-1-208."
