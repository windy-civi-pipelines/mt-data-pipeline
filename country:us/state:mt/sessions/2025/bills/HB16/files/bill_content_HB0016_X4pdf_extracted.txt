The local government or Indian tribal government receiving the loan may charge fees to the users of the
infrastructure. A loan repayment agreement must provide for repayment of the loan from the entity authorized to
charge fees for the use of the services of the infrastructure. Loans made pursuant to 17-6-309(2) qualify for the
job credit interest rate reductions under 17-6-318 if the interest rate reduction passes through to the business
creating the jobs.
(2) A loan pursuant to 17-6-309(2) and this section may not be made until the board is satisfied
that the condition in 17-6-309(2) will be met. If the condition contained in 17-6-309(2) is not met, any credits
received pursuant to subsection (3) of this section must be returned to the state.
