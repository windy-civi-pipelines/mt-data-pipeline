20 contract with a qualified contractor to construct the project prior to September 30 of the even-numbered year

22 obligation to the grant recipient ceases, and the funds revert to the historic preservation grant program account
23 established in 22-3-1307 for use in the next biennium.
24 (b) A grant recipient who fails to meet the contract deadline for either of the following reasons may
25 request one 2-year extension, during which the project must be placed under contract or any obligation to the
26 grant ceases:
27 (i) the project is damaged by fire or another form of casualty; or
28 (ii) the grant recipient fails to find a qualified contractor to construct the project and diligently
