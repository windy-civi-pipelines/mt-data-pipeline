23 pursued all reasonable avenues to find a qualified contractor.

17 established in 22-3-1307 for use in the next biennium.
18 (b) A grant recipient who fails to meet the contract deadline for either of the following reasons may
19 request one 2-year extension, during which the project must be placed under contract or any obligation to the
20 grant ceases:
21 (i) the project is damaged by fire or another form of casualty; or
22 (ii) the grant recipient fails to find a qualified contractor to construct the project and diligently
23 pursued all reasonable avenues to find a qualified contractor.
24 (7) Grant recipients shall complete all of the conditions described in [section 3(1)] by September
25 30, 2026, or any obligation to the grant recipient ceases.
