11
12 NEW SECTION. Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that:
13 (1) Government property, including state buildings AND GROUNDS, public schools, and other
14 government-owned facilities, should serve neutral governmental functions and not be used to promote political
15 or ideological advocacy.
16 (2) The United States flag and other officially recognized governmental flags represent the
17 collective identity, heritage, and sovereignty of the nation, state, and local entities and should be the primary
18 symbols displayed on government property.
19 (3) Allowing NONGOVERNMENTAL or politically charged symbols on state property creates
20 inconsistency in enforcement, legal challenges, and public divisiveness, undermining the neutrality and
21 inclusivity of government spaces.
22 (4) Flags honoring law enforcement officers, military service members, and public service
23 organizations provide appropriate, NONPOLITICAL recognition of their contributions to public safety and national
24 defense.
25 (5) [SECTIONS 1 THROUGH 3] DO not infringe on private speech or individual expression, as THEY
26 APPLY solely to government-controlled displays, ensuring personal freedoms remain intact while maintaining a
27 neutral public environment.
