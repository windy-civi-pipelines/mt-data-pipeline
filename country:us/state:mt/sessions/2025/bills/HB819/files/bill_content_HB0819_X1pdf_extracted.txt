69th Legislature 2025 HB 819
GOVERNMENT PROPERTY, STATE BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS, PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AND OTHER
GOVERNMENT-OWNED FACILITIES; PROVIDING LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS; PROVIDING DEFINITIONS;
PROVIDING RESTRICTIONS; PROVIDING EXCEPTIONS; AND PROVIDING AN IMMEDIATE EFFECTIVE

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:

Section 2:
Section 1. Legislative findings. The legislature finds that:
(1) Government property, including state buildings and grounds, public schools, and other
government-owned facilities, should serve neutral governmental functions and not be used to promote political
or ideological advocacy.
(2) The United States flag and other officially recognized governmental flags represent the
collective identity, heritage, and sovereignty of the nation, state, and local entities and should be the primary
symbols displayed on government property.
(3) Allowing nongovernmental or politically charged symbols on state property creates
inconsistency in enforcement, legal challenges, and public divisiveness, undermining the neutrality and
inclusivity of government spaces.
(4) Flags honoring law enforcement officers, military service members, and public service
organizations provide appropriate, nonpolitical recognition of their contributions to public safety and national
defense.
(5) [Sections 1 through 3] do not infringe on private speech or individual expression, as they apply
solely to government-controlled displays, ensuring personal freedoms remain intact while maintaining a neutral
public environment.
